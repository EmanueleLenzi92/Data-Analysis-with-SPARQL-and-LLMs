Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3014 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 08 SCA. It then talks about a cheese called Pultost, which is made from cow's milk without using rennet. Instead, they use a self-produced culture of old lactic bacteria strains.

Now, I need to determine if this cheese has PDO certification. PDO certification is specific and usually tied to a particular region or traditional method of production. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention anything about certifications like PDO. It focuses on the production method—using sour milk and a specific bacterial culture—but there's no reference to any official designations or protected status.

I should also consider if Pultost is a known cheese with PDO certification in real-world contexts, but since I'm instructed not to use external knowledge, I can't rely on that. Based solely on the given content, there's no indication of PDO certification.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't mention any certifications related to PDO for Pultost, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions "Parmigiano Reggiano DOP," which immediately stands out because DOP is an abbreviation for Denominazione di Origine Protetta, the Italian term for Protected Designation of Origin. That's a strong indicator that this cheese has PDO certification.

Further down, it talks about how Parmigiano Reggiano is produced with milk from the area of origin, using natural rennet and salt without additives. It also mentions that these products are certified as 'Mountain Product' under EU regulations 1151/2012 and 665/2014. While these are mountain product certifications, they tie into the PDO status because they have additional rules about geographical origin, diet of cows, breeding, and aging.

The narrative emphasizes that this cheese is one of Italy's most famous productions and that the value chain aims to preserve its tradition and quality. It also mentions that there are specific regulations governing its production, which aligns with what I know about PDO products—they have strict rules about where and how they're made.

Additionally, the mention of 350 small dairies and 3500 milk farmers-producers obtaining recognition to preserve unchanged processing methods suggests a certification system in place, likely the PDO. The focus on protecting the cheese's quality and image further supports this.

So putting it all together, the narrative clearly describes Parmigiano Reggiano as having DOP certification under the mountain product scheme. Therefore, the value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about three different cheese producers in the Nivegy-valley micro-region of Hungary. They produce high-quality artisanal cheeses and milk products. The animals they keep are goats and cows, which is pretty standard for cheese production. Their products are sold through various channels like SFCs (which I think stands for Short Food Chain), restaurants, farmers' markets, on-farm sales, and webshop delivery. 

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention anything about PDO certification. PDO is a specific designation that requires strict adherence to traditional methods, use of local ingredients, and other regulations. The producers here are described as using local grasslands and adapting modern marketing techniques like online sales. They also face challenges such as climate change and urbanization pressures, but there's no indication they're meeting the criteria for PDO.

Additionally, while they have a strong focus on quality and traditional methods, without explicit mention of PDO certification, I can't assume it's there. The narrative doesn't reference any specific designations or certifications beyond being high-quality artisanal products.

So, based on the information given, the cheese producers don't seem to have PDO certification.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Review Narrative:** The narrative describes three cheese producers in Hungary focusing on high-quality artisanal cheeses and milk products.
2. **Identify Keywords:** Terms like "high quality," "artisan," and "local" are mentioned but no specific mention of PDO.
3. **PDO Criteria:** PDO requires strict adherence to traditional methods, local ingredients, and official certification.
4. **Narrative Details:** The producers use local resources and modern marketing but there's no indication they meet PDO criteria or have such certification.
5. **Conclusion:** No evidence in the narrative suggests PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3131 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the VC (Value Chain) is labeled with a protected designation of origin (pdo). That's a strong indicator because PDO specifically refers to products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. So right there, it seems like cheese from this chain has PDO certification.

Looking further, the narrative talks about the success in registering a quality scheme and territorial identity with a PDO. It also mentions maintaining high milk prices for dairy producers due to competition and market openings within the EU. This suggests that the PDO status is actively managed and contributes to the economic sustainability of the chain.

Additionally, the cheese production is based on traditional knowledge dating back to the 17th century, which aligns with how PDO products are often tied to historical methods and local traditions. The mention of a new product called "girolle" being introduced through better organization and governance systems also indicates innovation within the framework of existing certifications like PDO.

The narrative doesn't provide any information that contradicts the presence of PDO certification. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of PDO in maintaining quality, economic viability, and traditional practices. Therefore, putting all this together, it's clear that the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given narrative involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading the narrative carefully.

The narrative has an ID of 3052. It mentions that the moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC13 ES. The main focus here is on organic production of olive oil in mountain areas. It talks about a small group of producers targeting a niche market to ensure their survival, emphasizing specific practices that conserve mountain ecosystems and landscapes.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specifically for products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Common examples include certain types of cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort.

Looking at the narrative, it's all about olive oil, not cheese. Olive oil is another product that can have PDO status, such as extra virgin olive oils from specific regions. However, the question is specifically asking about cheese with PDO certification. Since the narrative doesn't mention anything related to cheese production or any dairy products, I can conclude that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no mention of cheese in the narrative, it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. The correct response should be an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania and the reference card ID is VC 10 RO. It talks about 'Telemea' cheese being made by adding rennet to milk, curdling it, then processing it into cheesecloth, draining, pressing overnight, and cutting into squares. 

Next, there's a link provided: s://produse.produsmontan.ro/. I can't access external links, so I'll focus on the text description. It says that processing and approval for using OQT (which I think stands for Origin Quality Token) is done locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority regulates the market for 'Mountain Products' and ensures producers have authorization to use the OQT and proper labeling.

Now, I need to determine if this involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO is a specific EU certification that protects geographical names of products, ensuring they meet certain quality and production standards. From the narrative, it mentions 'Mountain Products' and OQT, which might be related but aren't explicitly stated as PDO. 

The text doesn't use the term "Protected Designation of Origin" or mention any PDO certification directly. It talks about authorization to use OQT and compliance with national regulations, but without explicit reference to EU's PDO, I can't assume it's the same thing. Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no clear indication that the cheese has PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2777 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is France CCVD, and the reference card ID is VC 02 FR1. That gives a hint about the region being in France, possibly related to specific agricultural products.

The primary sector here includes extensive sheep farming and pastoralism in the Drôme valley mountain areas. They have local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to consumers or with the label 'Agneau de Sisteron.' The term 'label' makes me think of certifications or designations, but I need to check if it's specifically about cheese.

Looking further, there are mentions of local valorization and added value through labels like 'Agneau de Sisteron.' This seems to be a specific product, likely meat since it's associated with sheep. However, the question is about cheese. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese production or any dairy products.

There's also talk about creating an organic sheep meat filière through direct sales and labels, which again points towards meat rather than cheese. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) where the specific origin and traditional methods are crucial.

Since the narrative focuses on sheep farming and meat production under a specific label but doesn't mention cheese or any dairy-related activities, it's unlikely that cheese with PDO certification is part of this value chain. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a farm called 'Latte del Parco' in Italy's Lessinia Regional Park. They produce milk, dairy products like cheese and yogurt, and confectionery items such as ice cream. The cows are grazed outdoors for seven months, which is part of their production process. The products are certified as 'mountain products' (MP) and labeled as being from the regional park.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of PDO certification. PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, which means the product must be produced in a specific region using traditional methods. In Italy, many cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Mozzarella di Bufala have PDO status.

In this narrative, the cheese is labeled as 'Product in the Lessinia Regional Park' and is part of their dairy tradition. However, there's no explicit mention of it being certified under a PDO scheme. They do talk about using natural resources and cultural context, but that doesn't necessarily equate to PDO certification unless specified.

Additionally, the narrative mentions that the products are not certified as organic, which might be a separate issue from PDO. There's also a note that the marketing strategy doesn't heavily emphasize authenticity or tradition beyond what's stated.

So, based on this information, I don't see any indication that the cheese has PDO certification. The key terms like 'certified' or 'PDO' aren't present in relation to the cheese products.

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification as there is no mention of such certification in the narrative.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3008 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference Card ID is VC 02 SCA. It talks about a cider made from local apples, specifically varieties like Discovery, Aroma, Gravenstein, and Summerred. There's a lot of data about GVA (Gross Value Added) percentages across different sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary—and some economic indicators for the region.

The narrative also discusses the success in registering a Geographical Indication (GI), which led to increased production and profitability. It mentions that this is the first Norwegian alcoholic drink with a geographical indication. The area is known for apple production since the 13th century, brought by British monks, and cider production started soon after.

The unique aspects of the product come from the Hardanger fjord's climate and soil minerals, influenced by the Gulf Stream. There are concerns about climate change affecting fruit quality and pest/disease issues. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous innovation type.

Now, I need to determine if cheese with PDO certification is involved. PDO certification is specifically for products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities due to that origin. The narrative here is about cider, not cheese. It mentions apples and their production, the GI registration for cider, and the economic impact of this designation.

There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the narrative. All the focus is on apple production and cider. Even though there's a geographical indication involved, it's for cider, not cheese. Therefore, since the value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON.

First, climate change is a significant challenge for honey production (both adverse effects on plants' biological cycles and the bees' ability to resist colder/warmer zones). Second, the honey market is quite competitive, and certification of origin or organic label can be insufficient without an appropriate marketing strategy designed by the farmer and promoter of certificate of origin (in this case, the Municipality of Amatrice). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation consists mainly in adhering to the Miele di Amatrice label, a certification of origin and craftsmanship of production promoted by the municipality of Amatrice.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the main actors are farmers and the municipality of Amatrice. The value chain doesn't depend on other SESs, which probably stands for something like Socio-Ecological Systems or similar terms in this context.

Looking at the products involved, it talks about a beekeeping farm adopting a honey certificate of origin established by the Municipality of Amatrice. They mention "Mielene di Amatric" as the certified honey. The area is known for organic or integrated agriculture due to the nature park's ecological constraints, which supports high-quality organic honey production.

The narrative also highlights that honey has historical and cultural significance in this mountain area, contributing to the VC's natural and cultural elements. Challenges include climate change affecting honey production and competition in the market, with certification being part of their strategy but needing a good marketing plan.

Nowhere in this narrative is cheese mentioned. The product discussed is honey, specifically "Miele di Amatrice," which has a certificate of origin. There's no reference to any dairy products or cheeses. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheese (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) where the specific geographical area and traditional methods are crucial.

Since the narrative focuses solely on honey and its certification, not cheese, I can conclude that the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.
</think>

The mountain value chain described involves a beekeeping farm producing certified organic honey ("Miele di Amatrice") but does not mention cheese. Therefore, it does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2877 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully to identify key points related to the products and any mention of PDO certification or similar terms.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The value chain (VC) has a specific ID: VC 44 IT. The farm in question raises about 120 Duroc pigs on open air and processes their meat into cured meats, which they sell at local markets. It notes that the quality of production has caused a surplus of demand compared to supply.

Further down, it mentions that the farm took advantage of EU regulations (Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and Reg.(UE) n.665/2014) to use the label 'Mountain Product.' These regulations are related to PDO and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) certifications, which protect traditional foods and their names.

The farm collaborates with other breeders in the community of Vottignasco to ensure production of healthy processed products. The innovation mentioned is about letting pigs graze in a wild state, resulting in healthier meat without gluten or chemical additives. The VC is classified as Innovative with exogenous innovation, involving forestry and natural local assets.

Now, looking for any mention of cheese. The narrative talks about cured meats but doesn't specifically mention cheese at all. PDO certification is typically associated with products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods.

Since the narrative focuses on pork production and cured meats, there's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain. Therefore, even though they use the 'Mountain Product' label which could relate to PDO, it's applied to their meat products, not cheese.

So, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Wait, the narrative talks about cured meat, not cheese. PDO certification is typically associated with products like cheese, wine, or certain meats where specific geographical origins contribute to their unique characteristics. Since this is about cured meat, I don't see any mention of cheese here. 

I should check if there's any indirect reference to cheese, but the narrative doesn't mention it at all. It's focused on meat production using mountain conditions. So, based solely on the content given, there's no indication that cheese with PDO certification is involved in this value chain.

It also notes that Zlatar cheese is highly rated in traditional restaurants and has presence in Belgrade.

Further down, the narrative explicitly states: "Zlatar cheese is registered PDO product at Serbian level..." This clearly indicates that the cheese does have a PDO certification. Additionally, it mentions efforts to organize farmers into associations for certification and management of the PDO product.

Alright, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2986 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the content step by step.

First, the narrative mentions Scotland as the reference member state and talks about breakfast puddings like haggis and Stornoway black pudding. It highlights their export value and cultural significance, especially in relation to tourism. The tertiary sector's contribution to GVA is noted, along with details about agricultural holdings and tourist accommodations.

The key part here is when it specifically mentions that Stornoway Black Pudding has PGI status. However, I notice that the term "cheese" isn't mentioned anywhere in the narrative. Instead, it focuses on puddings made from ingredients like oatmeal, barley, beef fat, and offal. These are clearly meat-based products rather than dairy products.

Since PDO certification applies to specific food products with a traditional link to a particular region, I know that cheese is a common category for such certifications. However, in this case, the product with PGI status is black pudding, which isn't cheese. Therefore, even though there's a protected designation, it doesn't apply to cheese.

I should also consider if any other parts of the narrative might imply cheese indirectly, but I don't see any mention of dairy products or cheese-related terms. The focus remains on puddings and their production methods.

So, putting it all together: the value chain involves a product with PGI certification (Stornoway Black Pudding), but that product is not cheese. Therefore, the JSON should be empty as per the instructions.

The natural asset used for producing 'Telemea' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing).    Value chains for artisanal products such as the 'Telemea' produced in the Vaideeni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality / 'counterfeit' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local dairy products), but this also brings additional challenges for small-scale farms. Lack of labour due to rural depopulation is also a very specific challenge which puts local farmers under increasing pressure. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania and the VC ID is VC 10 RO. The product in question is 'Telemea' cheese, which is made using rennet from milk. It's produced in Vaideeni commune in Vâlcea County. 

I see that it's registered as a 'Mountain Product' with a link provided to the Romanian Mountain Products registry. This suggests some form of official recognition, but I'm not sure if that equates to PDO certification.

PDO certification is a specific EU designation for products with a traditional link to a particular region. It requires strict geographical origin and traditional production methods. The narrative mentions Romania's use of Optional Quality Terms (OQT) for mountain products, which they've developed. However, it also notes that Romania doesn't use any derogation, meaning products must originate strictly from designated mountain areas without exception.

While 'Telemea' is recognized as a Mountain Product, the text doesn't explicitly state that it has PDO certification. It does talk about challenges with counterfeit products and the importance of registration for promotion, but again, this isn't the same as PDO status.

I should also consider if there's any mention of EU recognition or specific PDO designations in the narrative. The focus seems more on Romania's own system rather than EU-wide certifications like PDO. Therefore, without explicit mention of PDO certification, I can't confirm that 'Telemea' cheese has it.

The mountain value chain described does not explicitly involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. While the product is recognized as a 'Mountain Product' in Romania, there's no mention of EU PDO status.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 08 SCA. The main product discussed is Pultost, which is described as a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without the use of rennet. Instead, they use a self-produced culture with old strains of lactic bacteria.

The narrative provides various economic indicators like GVA shares across sectors and bed places in tourist accommodations, but I don't see any direct mention of PDO certification here. However, it does highlight that Pultost is a high-quality product with a strong reputation and tradition in the area. It's connected to natural assets like mountain pastures, which are crucial for the value chain.

There's also mention of social assets through cooperatives and cultural assets involving traditional knowledge about cheese production, cattle management, and ecological systems. The challenges include maintaining the VC against industrial dairies and preserving artisanal cheese making. The type of challenge is current, and it's classified as a Traditional VC with unspecified innovation.

Now, PDO certification typically requires that a product has specific characteristics due to its geographical environment, including natural and human factors. Pultost seems to fit because it's tied to local traditions, uses specific methods (like the self-produced culture), and relies on natural pastures. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that Pultost has PDO certification.

I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the product meets several criteria for PDO—traditional method, geographical specificity, and reliance on local resources. On the other hand, without an explicit mention of PDO certification in the text, I shouldn't assume it's certified. The narrative emphasizes tradition and quality but doesn't provide evidence of official PDO status.

Therefore, since there's no direct reference to PDO certification, I should conclude that the value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3087 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, looking at the narrative, it mentions that the Moving reference member state is Spain UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 27 ES. The key point here is about being labeled as PDO Los Pedroches. It specifies that pigs must be at least 75% Iberian breed and graze extensively in the dehesa within the area of Los Pedroches.

Wait a minute,PDO usually applies to products like cheese, wine, or other food items where the origin and specific production methods are crucial. However, in this narrative, they're talking about pigs and Iberian ham. The term "(PDO Los Pedroches" is mentioned, but it's referring to the pigs' breed and grazing conditions for producing ham, not cheese.

The narrative goes on to discuss the economic sectors, employment shares, and mentions that the product is a high-quality traditional food product nationwide. It also talks about sustainability of the dehesa ecosystem and innovations like e-commerce and processing plants for international markets.

Looking through all this, there's no mention of cheese at all. The focus is entirely on Iberian ham. So even though there's a PDO certification involved, it's not for cheese but for ham. Therefore, since the question specifically asks about cheese with PDO certification, this narrative doesn't fit that criteria.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 3087 does not involve cheese; instead, it focuses on Iberian ham with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions "Picodon AOP" as a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region. The term "AOP" stands for Appellation d'Origine Protégée, which is France's version of PDO. So that's a strong indicator that this cheese has PDO certification.

Looking further, it talks about strict requirements for the quality label AOP contributing to territorial identity. This aligns with what I know about PDO certifications, which often have specific production standards tied to a region.

The narrative also discusses how Picodon AOP is organized by producers' associations and trade unions, marketing both locally and through longer distribution channels. It mentions different types of production, including organic and conventional dairy products. Additionally, there's an emphasis on cultural aspects like tourism and ancestral know-how, which are often highlighted in PDO-designated products to maintain their regional identity.

The challenges faced by the value chain include issues like predation (wolves), droughts, biodiversity impacts, diseases, and parasites. They also mention efforts to valorize goat meat as a way to diversify for small producers. These points don't directly relate to whether it's PDO-certified but rather show the complexity of managing such a value chain.

The narrative classifies this VC as both Traditional and Innovative, with innovation in new products and processes. It involves land use systems like grassland and forestry, which supports sustainable practices often associated with PDO products.

Since Picodon AOP is explicitly mentioned and it's tied to specific regional production standards (AOP), I can confidently say that the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2989 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Serbia, and it's dominated by a single dairy production. There's a secondary dairy school in Pirot that's guarding traditional knowledge. They produce around 13,000 sheep, which probably relates to cheese production since sheep are common for certain cheeses.

Looking further, the narrative talks about Pirotski kackavalj, described as a hard cheese from Pirot. It's noted as a famous Serbian delicacy and part of the intangible cultural heritage. The ingredients are pure milk from Stara planina and salt, with a traditional manual process. This suggests it's a specific regional product.

Importantly, the narrative states that Pirot kackavalj is protected as PDO. It also mentions that while the cheese has PDO status, it doesn't fully realize its potential benefits for producers. There are challenges like depopulation and economic issues affecting production quantities and know-how preservation.

So, putting this together, the value chain does involve a cheese (Pirotski kackavalj) with PDO certification. The narrative explicitly mentions the PDO protection of Pirot cheese, which is a key point.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if a given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the "id" of the narrative; otherwise, I'll return an empty JSON.

First, let's understand what the user is asking for. They provided a specific narrative and want me to check if cheese with PDO certification is part of that value chain. The example they gave shows how the output should look in both cases—either with the ID or empty.

Looking at the narrative given:

ID Narrative: 2908
The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is NMK. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 NMK. Mainly the state-owned company (Makedonski Shumi) deals with the forestry and wood in the region of Maleshevija. Present in other Member States as well.

Okay, so let's break this down. The narrative talks about a value chain where the main activity is related to forestry and wood by a state-owned company called Makedonski Shumi in the region of Maleshevija. It also mentions that they are present in other member states.

Now, I need to check if cheese with PDO certification is involved here. PDO certification is specific to certain products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort cheese.

In the narrative provided, there's no mention of cheese at all. The focus is on forestry and wood processing. Makedonski Shumi deals with these resources, which are related to lumber, not dairy products. There's nothing indicating that they produce any kind of cheese, let alone one with PDO certification.

Additionally, the regions mentioned (Maleshevija) don't ring a bell as traditional cheese-producing areas with PDO status. Usually,PDO cheeses come from well-known regions like the Alps for certain types or specific areas in France, Italy, Spain, etc., where particular cheeses are made and protected by law.

Since there's no information about cheese production, processing, or any mention of dairy products in the narrative, it's safe to conclude that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this value chain. The focus is entirely on forestry and wood, which doesn't align with the typical sectors where PDO cheeses are found.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Despite these facts this area has suffered from demografic ageging as well as from a demographic decline. Most of the chestnut forest is currently abandoned and the vineyards are getting progressively abandoned as well because the people that upkeep them are ageging and there is not a continuity in this labors.   The microclimate of the Ribeira Sacra allows this region to produce some of the finest spanish wines. It also favours the chestnut production giving it a caliber and a sweet taste that are very valued in the market, specially for roasting.    The lack of formation on the maintenance and exploitation of both the chestnut and the vineyards represents a huge barrier for the incorporation of the local youth to the local value chains. Formation on the bussiness side of the activity is also required. Most of the grape producers lack formation on enology making it really hard to step up on their bussiness transforming it into more valuable goods as wine and liquor.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the "id" of the narrative; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully to identify any mentions related to cheese or PDO certification. The narrative is about the Ribeira Sacra region in Spain, focusing on chestnuts and wines, particularly in the Quiroga-Bibei subzone. It talks about the production of high-quality chestnuts and wines, their economic yield, and challenges faced by the local value chain.

Looking for cheese: I don't see any mention of cheese in the narrative. The products discussed are chestnuts and wines. There's no reference to dairy products or cheese-making processes. So, it seems like cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Next, checking for PDO certification: The narrative mentions that Ribeira Sacra is under the protection of a PDO, specifically for its wines. It says, "PDO Ribeira Sacra protects and promotes the wines produced in this area using traditional means and practices." So, while there's a PDO certification mentioned, it's for wine, not cheese.

Since the narrative doesn't involve cheese at all, even though there is a PDO certification for wine, the requirement is specifically about cheese with PDO. Therefore, the value chain here doesn't include cheese with such certification.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of cheese or if PDO could apply to other products, but in this case, it's clearly wines. The narrative focuses on chestnuts and wines, so cheese isn't part of the conversation.

To summarize: The narrative discusses a value chain involving chestnuts and wine with PDO certification for the wine. There's no mention of cheese. Therefore, the answer should be an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2877 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Italy, specifically UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 44 IT. The farm raises about 120 Duroc pigs on open air and processes the meat into cured meats which sells at local markets. It also notes that the quality of production has caused a surplus, but it's cut off there.

Looking through this information, I see that the value chain involves pig farming and processing cured meats. There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the narrative. PDO certification is typically associated with products like cheese, wine, or other food items where specific geographical origins contribute to their unique characteristics. Since the focus here is on pork and cured meats, it doesn't seem relevant.

I should also consider if there's any indirect connection, but given the information provided, there's nothing indicating that cheese is part of this value chain. The local assets mentioned are natural, which might relate to grazing areas for dairy cows, but again, no cheese production is indicated.

Therefore, based solely on the content given, the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference Moving Card ID is VC 11 UK. It talks about Scotch beef being awarded PGI status if produced in Scotland under specific conditions. There's a lot of data about population density, income levels, GVA, sector shares, bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, nearest large settlements, protected areas, and employment sectors.

Further down, it discusses the successful registration of the PGI scheme for Scotch beef, emphasizing its importance to the Highlands and Islands region. It mentions conservation through environmental schemes and grazing on common land. There's also a note about creating a local abattoir to shorten supply chains and reduce environmental impact.

Nowhere in this narrative is cheese mentioned. The focus is entirely on Scotch beef as a PGI product. Cheese isn't part of the conversation, whether it's with PDO certification or not. So, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that cheese with PDO certification is involved in this value chain.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the narrative provided: ID 2981 talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions Ben Lomond, the most southerly 'Munro'. It discusses cultural challenges like 'Munro Bagging' and touches on safeguarding the natural environment due to access pressures. 

Now, I'm trying to see if there's any mention of cheese or anything related to food products with PDO certification. The narrative is focused on a mountain area, specifically Ben Lomond, but it doesn't talk about agriculture, dairy production, or any specific cheeses that might have PDO status.

PDO certification typically applies to products like certain types of cheese where the origin and traditional methods are protected. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano in Italy or various French cheeses. However, the narrative here is centered around environmental and cultural aspects of mountaineering, not food production.

I don't see any keywords related to cheese, dairy, or food processing in the text. It's more about tourism, access management, and environmental challenges rather than the economic activities like cheesemaking that would be relevant for PDO certification.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative has an ID of 3141 and mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2. The reference card ID is VC 41 CH2. It talks about a familiar farm on 2 hectares of land where plants are planted, weeded, harvested by hand, and dried in a specially designed dryer. Each plant requires specific attention, and it's noted that these producers are in the Swiss mountain regions.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or anything related to dairy products because PDO certification is specifically for certain foods like cheeses. The narrative describes planting, weeding, harvesting, and drying plants. It doesn't explicitly say what kind of product they're making from these plants. They could be herbs, vegetables, or something else entirely.

Since the focus is on cheese with PDO certification, I need to see if there's any indication that the products are dairy-based or specifically cheeses. The term "plants" is quite broad and doesn't necessarily point towards cheese. There's no mention of milk processing, cheese-making steps, or any specific cheese names like Gruyère or Emmental, which are famous Swiss cheeses with PDO status.

The narrative emphasizes the organic and artisanal aspects of farming but without linking it to dairy products. Therefore, based solely on the information given, there's no evidence that the value chain involves cheese. It could be herbs, teas, or another non-dairy product.

Since there's no mention of cheese or any indication that the product is a dairy item with PDO certification, I should conclude that the value chain doesn't involve such cheese. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

During the 20th century the surface area of Savoyard vineyards was drastically reducted.

The village high quality produces wines from Altesse (unique local variety existing only on this territory) which are sold under the Roussette de Savoie appellation (specifically under the Marestel cru title). The highest slopes of coteaux Marestel above the village have excellent soil characteristics and mesoclimate for the late-ripening, low-yielding Altesse variety.    The main challenge was to reconstruct from zero the 25 ha of vineyard on the steep slope (50-60%) of the coteaux Marestel, historically known as a good spot for high quality wine production, which was abandoned due to the demographic dynamics of the 20Th century and due to the difficulties connected to the mountain wine production (manual work, steep slopes). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and vineyards. The local assets include Natural and cultural.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2886 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that France VINIDEA is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The reference card ID is VC 01 FR. It talks about wine growing being the second largest agricultural activity in Savoyard agriculture after milk production. There are six commercial wine producers in Jongieux, and they mention specific percentages regarding GVA shares across sectors.

The narrative also provides data on tourist accommodations, number of agricultural holdings, nearest large settlements, protected areas, sector employment shares, and historical changes in vineyard surfaces. It discusses the reconstruction of vineyards on steep slopes and mentions high-quality wines produced from Altesse grapes under the Roussette de Savoie appellation, specifically the Marestel cru title.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus seems to be entirely on wine production—its history, challenges, reconstruction efforts, and specific appellations related to wine. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain, let alone whether it has PDO certification.

Since the question specifically asks about cheese with PDO certification, and there's no relevant information in the provided text, I can conclude that the mountain value chain does not involve such cheese.

The narrative focuses on wine production, particularly from Altesse grapes under the Roussette de Savoie appellation. There is no mention of cheese or dairy products, so it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2798 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that Milk Kid is seasonally produced, mostly for Christmas, by approximately 200 farmers. It talks about an association of farmers involved in slaughtering animals and local administrative units, but there's no mention of cheese production specifically. The focus seems to be on milk kids, which I believe refers to young goats or lambs raised for their milk.

The narrative discusses issues with modernization leading dairy producers to specialize in milk and not knowing what to do with the kids. It also mentions that local culinary uses are diminishing, affecting the local markets and reducing added value from one animal. The challenge is about reconnecting activities like milk production with lamb breeding, which have been separated due to specialization.

There's a mention of high reputation products and local culinary heritage but no specific reference to cheese or any PDO certification. PDO typically applies to products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods, like certain cheeses in France such as Roquefort or Camembert. Since the narrative doesn't name any specific cheese or indicate that the product has such certification, I can't assume it does.

Additionally, the value chain is classified as Traditional but without any mention of PDO-protected products. The focus seems more on reconnecting different parts of the agricultural process rather than marketing a specific protected cheese.

So, based on the given content, there's no indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.27%.   The dairy, owned by a local cooperative of farmers, collects and processes the milk produced by 24 local farmers to produce Italian and local cheeses. For the production of the traditional Friulian cheese called 'Montasio', the dairy obtained in 2011 the certification 'denomination product of origin (DPO) and 'mountain product' (MP) label. In this case, the VC is strongly linked to the natural (pasture, mountain, cows, etc.) and cultural (cheese production, mountain culture, etc.) elements of the SES. The dairy's products are traditional, and innovations include adopting quality certificates and some 'new products' (but based on the food local tradition). This guarantees a competitive advantage in the market. In the dairy shop, local cheeses and milk are offered, and various other products from local and regional producers. Some of these products use cheeses from dairy (e.g. 'Frico').   The SES is involved in the VC for several reasons. The grasslands and cultivated land are used for foraging dairy cattle (exclusively Italian Red Fleckvieh cattle). The cultural dimension is involved in the production skills related to traditional cheese making in the Friuli region. From a social viewpoint, cooperative organisational forms to face economic problems are common.    The market of dairy products is very competitive due to the presence of a wide variety of cheese. Product and process innovation is relevant for competitiveness, but this VC innovation appears limited to the acquisition of quality certificates (e.g. DPO and MP). Moreover, the dairy's reference market is local (the cooperative has its point of sale in Malborghetto Valbruna), where other typical products of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region are also proposed. Recently, home delivery sales have been adopted for a limited area. These

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the dairy cooperative produces Italian and local cheeses. Specifically, it talks about the traditional Friulian cheese called 'Montasio'. It says that in 2011, the dairy obtained a certification for 'denomination product of origin (DPO) and 'mountain product' (MP) label. 

Wait, DPO stands for Denominazione di Origine Protetta, which is Italy's version of PDO. So Montasio cheese has this certification. The value chain involves producing this cheese, so it definitely includes a cheese with PDO certification.

I should check if there are any other mentions or clues. The narrative also talks about the cooperative using local resources and traditional methods, which aligns with how PDO cheeses are typically produced to maintain specific regional characteristics.

So yes, since Montasio has DPO certification, which is equivalent to PDO, the value chain does involve cheese with such certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2792 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the Value Chain ID is VC 06 FR. The union gathering firms isn't very active, and the market is demanding without production or trade rules. It's influenced by summer and export markets.

Looking at the sectors, the primary sector share of employment in the region is 0.036, secondary is 0.162, and tertiary is 0.802. So, most employment is in the tertiary sector, which usually includes services, retail, etc., but that's not directly related to cheese production.

The narrative then talks about pork meat products made by big firms using imported raw materials from lean pigs for the European market. Some of these products have PGI certification since 2019 and are part of the reputation of 'Corsican charcuterie'. It mentions whether a traditional mountain product's reputation can be shared with other actors, both external and internal to the mountain area.

It also discusses challenges like linking up with local breeders for meat suitable for mid-range deli meats, using local resources like acorns and cereals. There's benchmarking towards Italian 'suino pesante' production systems. The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or dairy products. It's focused on pork meat products, specifically charcuterie items like dry sausages. While there's a mention of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) for some products, these are related to pork meat, not cheese. PDO certification is specifically for cheeses and other food products with a specific geographical origin.

Therefore, since the value chain deals with pork products and not cheese, even though some products have PGI certification, it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2792 focuses on pork meat products with PGI certification but does not involve cheese. Therefore, it does not include cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy, specifically UNIMOL and UNIPI. It also notes that the value chain isn't dependent on other SES for production. The relevant actor here is a farmer who produces and processes peppers. The products are labeled as such, and the land use systems involved are cropland and natural land. Additionally, there's a ZAC (dog training area) for hunting dogs on the land.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specifically for agricultural products and foodstuffs that have traditional significance within a region. It requires that the product not only comes from a specific place but also follows traditional methods of production.

Looking at the narrative, the key product mentioned is peppers. There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the text. The farmer is involved in producing and processing peppers, which are vegetables, not dairy products. PDO certification typically applies to cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort, but not to vegetables like peppers.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't reference any specific certifications related to food production beyond mentioning the ZAC area for dogs, which seems unrelated to food processing or PDO standards. There's no indication that the peppers are processed into a dairy product or meet the criteria for PDO certification.

Therefore, since the value chain is centered around pepper production and there's no mention of cheese or any certifications related to it, especially PDO, I can conclude that this narrative doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let's break down the information given in the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is FRANCE INRAE, and the reference MOVING Card ID is VC 12 FR. That tells me it's related to France, which is a country known for its cheeses with PDO certifications, like Roquefort or Camembert. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.

Next, it says that "Milk Kid" is seasonally produced, mostly for Christmas, by approximately 200 farmers. The term "Milk Kid" isn't immediately familiar to me as a specific cheese, but it's described as being produced around Christmas. That makes me think of traditional cheeses or dairy products made during specific times of the year.

An association of farmers is involved in slaughtering animals and managing local assets, which include natural and cultural aspects. This suggests that there's a community-driven production process, possibly adhering to local traditions or regulations, which could be relevant for PDO certification since such certifications often require traditional methods and local ingredients.

The value chain is described as rare and present in other mountains of France, specifically the Alps and CCVD (which I think might be a typo or abbreviation; perhaps it's meant to say something else like another region). It also mentions that similar issues are arising there. Additionally, they compare this production with that of kid dedicated to meat in Portugal regarding resource use and specialization.

Now, considering PDO certification, the key factors are geographical origin, traditional methods, and quality linked to the region. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese; it talks about "Milk Kid," which I'm not sure is a cheese or another dairy product. If it's cheese, then maybe it's a type of cheese made in specific mountain regions of France.

However, without explicit mention of cheese or PDO certification, I can't confirm that the value chain involves such cheese. The narrative focuses more on production methods and regional presence but doesn't tie it to a specific cheese product with PDO status.

Therefore, based solely on the given content, there's no clear indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, based solely on the given information, the value chain might involve local cheese, but without explicit evidence of PDO certification, I shouldn't assume it.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2764 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the value chain uses an EU PGI label. PGI stands for Protected Geographical Indication, which is similar to PDO but slightly different. PDO is for products whose characteristics are entirely due to their geographical environment, while PGI can also include factors like traditional methods. So, I should note that they're using a PGI label here.

Looking further, the product in question is a cake called 'Valašský' from the Beskydy mountains. It's made traditionally for about 200 years and uses pears as the topping. The narrative emphasizes its link to the region and the use of the regional name 'Vallachian.' There are issues with fake products mimicking it, which suggests that the genuine product has a specific geographical association.

Nowhere in the description does it mention cheese. Instead, it's talking about a cake. Cheese would typically be an ingredient or the main product, but here, the focus is on a baked good. The PGI label is for the cake, not for any dairy product like cheese.

So, putting this together: the value chain involves a cake with a PGI certification, not cheese with PDO. Therefore, since the question specifically asks about cheese with PDO, and there's no mention of cheese in the narrative, the answer should be an empty JSON.

Since the product in question is herb liquers and not cheese, and there's no mention of PDO certification, I can conclude that this mountain value chain does not involve cheese with such certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the reference card ID is VC 09 CH2. It talks about Alpine Gruyère being produced seasonally from April to October in 53 alpine chalets. There's an organization called the Gruyère Interprofession created in 1997.

Looking further down, it says that emblematic Swiss cheese, known and exported worldwide, is a high-quality product with an international reputation. It also mentions a successful registration of a quality scheme with a PDO. The narrative explicitly states that this cheese is connected to cattle farming, which is the main farming system in Switzerland and representative of Swiss agriculture.

Since Gruyère is mentioned as having a PDO certification, it fits the criteria. Therefore, I should create a JSON object with the "id" of the narrative.

Their production ranges from very extnensive to semi intensive, and intensive, from lack of any mechanisation and treatment to fully organised fishpond productions. Fresh fish is sold usually localy and through HORECA sector, while bigger facilities are starting processing and packaging for more remote markets, as demain is increasing. The organic production is underdeveloped though an interesting niche market. Linkages with tourism are strong not only outlets for the final product, but also in promotion of sport fishery in the mountain regions which are in case of Bajina Basta protected as Natural Park and cross border regions of Drina river watershead. Some companies are even having their operations in both countries (Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia) using the best locations for the production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Dinarid mountains, mountain Tara. Heavily relying on the natural capacity of the mountain springs and waterflwos the trout production is very conditioned and interlinked with the fresh mountain water ecosystesm. There are several considerations to note, starting from the almost full conversion to production of invasive species such as RAinbow or California trout, to intensification of production in trout fish farms and in cages. Due to a water shortage in the summer period, as well as lack of aeration and oxygenation systems, production on a number of farms is 10 to 20 kg/m3, which means that farms only operate at partial capacity. Still this is considered to be a very high quality protein food and due to the strong potential for income diversification in mountain areas, as well as the market demand from HORECA, it is often a small scale bussines placed close to touristic areas nature protected regions all over Western Balkans. The production practices can be improved to reduce environemntal impacts to minimum.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided text.

The narrative is ID 2999 and it's about a trout value chain in Serbia, specifically in the Western Serbia region within the Dinaric Alps. It mentions small actors, production ranges from extensive to intensive, and talks about fresh fish being sold locally and through HORECA (Hospitality, Restaurants, Cafés) sector. There are some processing activities like smoking, fillets, and pate mentioned.

Nowhere in this text is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on trout production—how it's done, the challenges faced, market distribution, and processing methods. PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products, including cheeses, wines, and sometimes fish products under certain conditions. However, since the narrative doesn't reference cheese at all, I can confidently say that this value chain isn't about cheese.

Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object because there's no indication of cheese with PDO certification involved.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is NMK, and the VC ID is 09 NMK. The key actors are involved in cheese production under brands like Maleshevo milk Berovo, Mlekara Malesh, Mlekara Natasha, and Farma Pacarski. It also notes that sheep breeding is a traditional activity in Maleshevija, and Berovo cheese is recognized as a quality product both nationally and beyond.

The narrative highlights that the cheese has high quality due to the clean environment in the mountains of Maleshevija. It's mentioned that Maleshevski cheese has a very good identity and is sold across the country with high demand. However, there's no explicit mention of any certification like PDO.

I know that PDO certification requires specific conditions related to the origin, production methods, and quality. While the narrative emphasizes the unique environment and traditional methods, it doesn't state that the cheese has obtained a PDO certification. It does talk about potential for development in the market chain but doesn't provide evidence of existing certifications.

Therefore, based solely on the information given, I can't confirm that the cheese has PDO certification. The answer should be an empty JSON.

Okay, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3015 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the cheese is made from April to October using milk from local goats. It's part of the region's cultural heritage and identity, which suggests it might have some special recognition. The cheese market they host annually and their association with Norsk Gardsost could indicate a certification, but I'm not sure if that's PDO specifically.

Looking at the details provided, there's no explicit mention of any certifications like PDO. They talk about high quality and reputation nationwide, which are good indicators, but without specific references to PDO or similar designations, I can't confirm it. 

So, based on the content given, there's no evidence that the cheese has a PDO certification. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3030 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Slovakia, with a reference card ID VC 04 SK. The key activities listed are sheep breeding, wool selling, wool processing, and marketing. The key actors involved are sheep breeders, processors, and consumers. It also notes positive impacts on local and regional social aspects, involving grassland, natural, social, and cultural elements.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products because PDO certification typically applies to such items. However, the activities here revolve around sheep breeding and wool processing. The focus is on wool, not milk or cheese production. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain. 

PDO certification usually pertains to products like wine, cheese, olive oil, etc., where specific geographical regions and traditional methods are recognized. Since the narrative doesn't mention any dairy-related activities or products, it's safe to conclude that cheese with PDO certification isn't involved here.

Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2893 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy's Valtellina region. The main products are high-quality red wines, specifically Valtellina Superiore DOCG. There's a lot of detail about the wine production, including the use of Nebbiolo grapes and traditional methods like building dry stone walls for terracing.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products because the question is about whether cheese with PDO certification is part of this value chain. Scanning through the narrative, I see that all the focus is on wine. There's talk about vineyards, winemaking techniques, and marketing strategies related to wine. The challenges mentioned are about high production costs due to difficult terrain and maintenance of terraces, but again, these relate to wine production.

There's no section or sentence in the narrative that discusses cheese at all. It doesn't mention any dairy products, milk processing, or cheese-making activities. All the economic data—like GVA contributions, sector shares, employment figures—are centered around agriculture and viticulture, not dairy.

Since the value chain is entirely focused on wine production, particularly red wines with a specific DOCG certification, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this chain. PDO certification here refers to the wine, not any cheese product. Therefore, there's no involvement of cheese with PDO in this narrative.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, and the Value Chain (VC) ID is VC 05 CZ. The primary activities are sheep breeding, husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. Farms here often use organic methods. 

Looking at the economic data, it shows shares of GVA across sectors but doesn't directly mention cheese or PDO. However, in the section about the VC itself, it says that sheep dairy products represent a specific market niche and are highly demanded. It also notes that these products utilize the symbolic value of the region's mountains, associating them with purity and nature, which is used in promotions.

The narrative emphasizes the unique niche market created by sheep dairy products and mentions that farms use organic methods and the natural assets of the locality. While it talks about the quality and marketing aspects, there's no explicit mention of PDO certification. PDO typically requires specific geographical origins and traditional production methods, but without a direct reference to any certification like PDO, I can't confirm its involvement.

So, based on the information given, even though the products are unique and marketed with regional pride, there's no indication that they have PDO certification.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The narrative describes a value chain focused on sheep husbandry in mountainous regions of the Czech Republic, producing dairy products.

2. **Look for PDO Indicators:** PDO certification requires specific mentions of geographical origin and traditional methods. The text doesn't explicitly reference any certifications like PDO.

3. **Assess Market Positioning:** While the products are niche and marketed using regional symbolism, this positioning doesn't equate to having a PDO label.

4. **Conclusion:** Without explicit mention of PDO, it's determined that the value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2838 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content to see if there's any mention related to cheese or PDO.

Looking at the narrative, it starts by talking about Eplény ski arena in Hungary and its impact on tourism during both winter and summer. It mentions things like downhill cycling, artificial snow, modern infrastructure, and economic development through tourism-related income. There are statistics about Gross Value Added (GVA) across different sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary—and employment shares.

I'm scanning for any keywords related to agriculture, dairy products, or cheese. The primary sector is mentioned with a 4.78% share of GVA and 4.47% employment in the province and region. However, the narrative doesn't specify what the primary sector includes here. It could be farming, including dairy, but without explicit mention of cheese production, it's hard to confirm.

The focus seems heavily on tourism, with new services, marketing strategies, and infrastructure developments. There are challenges mentioned like climate change affecting ski seasons and environmental issues from tourism activities. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, involving endogenous and exogenous innovations related to new products and marketing.

Since the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese or any dairy products, let aloneProtected Designation of Origin certification, I can't find evidence that PDO cheese is part of this mountain value chain. It's more about tourism and skiing infrastructure rather than agricultural or food-related products.

The marketing strategy also stresses the link between the Di Nucci dairy with Alto Molise's cultural and rural tradition (like the practice of transhumance) and supporting sustainable development initiatives. The company as a clear vocation for internationalization, oriented towards the haute cuisine sector and experiential tourism (e.g., dairy crafts museum). A new marketing strategy emphasises the family and territorial tradition that makes the product 'unique'. At the same time, the Di Nucci promoted collaboration with local actors, both farmers and institutions, playing a relevant (or even pivotal) role in local development strategy.   The territorial context (in its natural and cultural-historical settings) is engaged in the value chain through both dairy craft skills and cow breeding. Here a social value exchange where a form of cooperation prevails between the different actors involved in the Vcs.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2853 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Di Nucci family organized Value Chains involving local economic actors like breeders in high-quality traditional dairy productions. The company is a very old family business dating back to 1662 and produces typical local cheese, specifically mentioning Caciocavallo cheese. 

Caciocavallo is an Italian cheese, and I recall that many traditional Italian cheeses have PDO certifications. PDO ensures that the product not only comes from a specific region but also that its production methods are traditional and contribute to the local economy and culture.

The narrative emphasizes that the production cycle uses only local raw materials, ensuring fair economic collaboration with local breeders who supply milk under high quality and environmental sustainability standards. This attention to local sourcing and traditional methods aligns well with PDO requirements, which often require specific ingredients and processes tied to a particular region.

Additionally, the marketing strategy highlights the link between Di Nucci dairy and Alto Molise's cultural and rural traditions, such as transhumance practices. This connection to local culture and history further supports the likelihood of PDO certification, asPDO products are recognized for their regional heritage.

The narrative also mentions that the company is focused on internationalization, targeting haute cuisine and experiential tourism. High-end markets often seek products with certifications like PDO because they guarantee quality and authenticity, which can enhance marketability.

While there's no explicit mention of PDO certification in the text, the details about traditional production methods, local ingredients, and cultural significance strongly suggest that Caciocavallo cheese from Di Nucci likely has such a certification. Therefore, I should include the narrative ID in the JSON response.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2972 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference Moving Card ID is VC 13 UK. It talks about forestry being managed for commercial or recreational use but notes a growing interest in artisanal or bespoke wood products. The primary sector shares are given as around 4%, both for the province and region, with secondary sectors at 22.6% and 27.2%, respectively.

The narrative then goes into detail about high-quality, handcrafted timber products made using traditional methods. It emphasizes the use of local reclaimed timber to ensure short supply chains and sustainability. There's a mention of natural assets like upland mountain areas providing timber, along with a steady climate and maintained land use. Social and cultural assets are highlighted, including good relations among stakeholders and traditional knowledge for production.

Challenges include reduced availability of wood due to government forestry targets and decreased tourism because of Brexit and COVID-19.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on timber, woodworking, and related sectors. There's no indication that the value chain involves food products like cheese, let alone ones with PDO certification. PDO typically applies to agricultural products, especially cheeses, wines, etc., but since the narrative doesn't touch on such items, it's clear cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in question does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3070 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning Spain's ADEGUA as the reference member state. The value chain is about Rute's mantecados and polvorones, which are traditional sweets. These products have prestige in the region, contribute to a local production cluster, and create seasonal jobs. 

Looking at the economic data, the braiary sector (which I think refers to dairy or livestock) contributes 73.46% of the GVA in the region. That's a significant portion. There are details about tourist accommodations with 407 bed places, but that seems more related to tourism than cheese specifically.

The narrative mentions that since the mid-20th century, there's been a value chain for mantecados. It involves three main bakeries employing over 300 people, many women. They produce vegan sweets and vegetable fats, which suggests diversification beyond traditional dairy products. There's also mention of artistic chocolate, exhibitions, and collaborations with other sectors like liquors and hams, attracting a lot of visitors.

The ingredients used are lard, almonds, sugar, and flour. Most raw materials come from outside the production area. The value chain includes museums and shops, creating a thematic park for Christmas products. 

Challenges include diet changes reducing animal fats and sugar, leading to new product lines. Innovation is both endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external), focusing on new products and marketing strategies. They're trying to break seasonality by diversifying their offerings.

Now, the key point: does this involve cheese with PDO certification? Mantecados and polvorones are typically sweet pastries, not cheeses. Cheese would usually fall under dairy products, but here the focus is more on baked goods. The mention of lard suggests animal fat, which could be related to dairy, but it's used in baking, not cheese production.

There's no specific mention of cheese or any PDO-certified dairy products. Instead, the emphasis is on confectionery and their innovations like vegan sweets. PDO certification usually applies to cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort, which have specific geographical origins and traditional methods. Since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all, it's safe to conclude that this value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Raw milk is not a new product because it has always been consumed in this way in rural areas, but it can represent a new strategy for selling milk, more natural and above all sold directly (the consumer's desire to consume locally and not processed).   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest.    Conservation is a challenge since raw milk must be sold quickly as it cannot be stored at room temperature for several days. The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario).

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is very short and includes farmers and potentially resellers in local markets. The main product here is raw milk, which cannot be stored for long and is sold directly. It talks about the desire to consume locally and not processed, highlighting a return to traditional forms of milk consumption.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese specifically. Instead, the focus is on raw milk production, its sale, and the challenges related to storage and climate change affecting pasture lands. There's also a discussion about marketing strategies and land use systems but no reference to cheese or any certification like PDO.

Since the question is about whether the value chain involves cheese with PDO certification, and since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, I can conclude that it doesn't involve such cheese. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the VC is in Switzerland 2, specifically involving milk producers from the Jura mountain areas. It's made up of 11 manufacturers and ripeners as well as milk producers. The key point here is that they successfully registered a quality scheme with a PDO, which directly relates to their cheese product.

The narrative also talks about maintaining high milk prices for dairy producers despite market competition and EU openings. This suggests that the cheese has a recognized quality standard, which aligns with PDO certification because such certifications often help in maintaining premium pricing due to their unique characteristics tied to a specific region.

Additionally, it's mentioned that Vacherin cheese is produced in France but without the same PDO label or recipe. This comparison emphasizes that the Swiss version does have the PDO, whereas the French one doesn't. Therefore, this confirms that the value chain in question involves cheese with PDO certification.

So, putting it all together, the narrative clearly indicates the presence of a PDO-certified cheese within the mountain value chain.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the narrative provided.

The narrative has an ID of 2850 and mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The key activities include forestry, local assets like cultural aspects, and it talks about systems involved such as Forestry. It also mentions key actors, labelling, quality schemes, dependencies on local SES (Socio-Economic Systems), and impacts on regional SES.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products with PDO certification. PDO is a specific type of protected status that indicates a product's origin and traditional method of production. Common examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano, Mozzarella di Bufala, etc., which are often associated with Italian regions.

In the narrative provided, there's no explicit mention of cheese or dairy products at all. The focus seems to be on forestry systems and cultural aspects. There's talk about key activities in forestry, local assets being cultural, but nothing related to agriculture, dairy, or food production that would involve PDO certification for cheese.

I should also consider if any indirect references might hint towards cheese. For example, sometimesPDO cheeses are tied to specific regions known for their milk and cheese production. However, the narrative doesn't specify any such details. It's more about forestry and cultural aspects without linking them to food products.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. The narrative focuses on different areas but doesn't touch upon dairy or agricultural products that would require such a certification.

The narrative does not mention cheese or any product with PDO certification. It focuses on forestry and cultural aspects.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the narrative provided.

The narrative mentions a cooperative called Weizer Schafbauern - Die Schaferei, which owns the brand Määh. They produce various products including meat (lamb), milk, and milk products such as cheese, yogurt, cream, and cosmetics. The text also notes that they have different marketing channels like direct sales, online shops, supermarkets, etc.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of PDO certification specifically related to their cheese products. PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, which is a label given to food products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. 

Going through the narrative again, I don't see any explicit reference to PDO certification for their cheese or any other product they produce. They do mention that Weizer mountain lamb is classified as traditional food in Austria, but that's about lamb, not cheese. There's also a note about organic certification when they rebuilt the slaughterhouse, but that's under EC regulations and doesn't specifically tie to PDO.

Since there's no direct mention of PDO for their cheese products, I can conclude that the value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2748 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, specifically focusing on the Iskar Gorge near Sofia. It talks about the gorge's geological features, its length, and popularity as a tourist destination. There are statistics provided about the economic sectors in the province and region, including primary, secondary, and tertiary sector shares of GVA (Gross Value Added) and employment.

The challenges mentioned relate to visitor management issues, such as overcrowding at viewing points due to limited parking. The value chain is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese production, dairy products, or anything related to food or agriculture beyond the general statistics about agricultural holdings. There's no indication that PDO-certified cheese is part of this value chain. PDO certification typically applies to specific food products with a traditional link to a particular region, but since the focus here is on tourism and natural景观 (landscape), there's no evidence pointing towards any such product.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, I can conclude that the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2890 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative talks about a value chain centered around viticultural activity on an island, specifically mentioning wine production. It details percentages for different sectors and mentions specific wines like 'Malvasia delle Lipari' and Corinto Nero variety. There's also talk about marketing strategies and challenges related to isolation and production costs.

Nowhere in the narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on wine, its production methods, marketing, and the local economy surrounding it. Since PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) or wines (like Champagne), I'm looking for either term here.

The narrative does mention 'Malvasia delle Lipari' as a traditional wine with PDO status, but that's a wine, not cheese. There's no indication of cheese production or any dairy-related activities in the value chain described.

Therefore, since the value chain is about wine and doesn't involve cheese, especially not one with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. It mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE, and the value chain (VC) has a card ID VC 04 FR. There are details about dairies collecting milk from dairy farmers, both Ewe and Goat. Some farmers make their own cheese twice a year.

Looking further, it talks about high reputation products and mentions that dairies produce a large range of cheeses embedding local typicality. They have different sizes and know standardization with various intensity. The narrative also references the production of cheese in other MRLs (Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland) and notes that recognition of GIs (Geographical Indications) is common there.

Now, I need to determine if any of this relates to PDO certification. PDO is a specific type of GI that applies to products originating from a specific region with traditional methods. The narrative mentions "local typicality" and "recognition of GIs," which suggests that the cheeses might have some form of protected status. However, it doesn't explicitly mention PDO by name.

I should consider whether "Geographical Indications" (GIs) mentioned here include PDOs. In the EU, PDO is a subset of GI, so if they're recognized in the regions like Italy and Switzerland, which do have many PDO cheeses, it's possible that the cheeses in question are PDO-certified.

But wait, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that the cheese has PDO certification. It only mentions GIs in general. Without an explicit mention, I can't be certain. The example given by the user shows a JSON with the ID if it involves PDO cheese, but here, since it's not directly stated, I should err on the side of caution.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided and without external knowledge, I cannot confirm that the cheese has PDO certification. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3053 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the content step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 16 ES. It talks about springs discovered at the end of the 18th century and declared mineral-medicinal water in 1818. There are various percentages given for different sectors' shares of GVA (Gross Value Added) and employment, as well as data on tourist accommodations and agricultural holdings.

The narrative then discusses Lanjarón, a brand of natural mineral water owned by Aguas Danone, SA, which is part of the Danone Group. It mentions that the water comes from the Salud spring in Lanjarón in the Sierra Nevada massif in Granada province. The focus here is on the mineral water and its environmental commitments, such as using recycled plastic bottles and dedicating profits to eco-friendly initiatives.

There's also mention of legal protection perimeters for mineral waters, including recharge zones and controlling activities that might affect water quality. Additionally, it notes that some waters are in a National Park, like Sierra Nevada, adding another layer of protection.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any reference to cheese or dairy products. The entire focus seems to be on mineral water production, specifically Lanjarón water. There's no mention of cheese being part of the value chain, whether it's PDO-certified or not.

Since the question is about identifying if the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification, and given that all the information points towards a mineral water brand without any dairy products, I can conclude that cheese isn't part of this value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Scotland Hutton and a specific card ID, VC 02 UK. It then mentions traditional Welsh artisinal Caerphilly cheese being protected under a European Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). I know that PGI is similar to PDO but slightly different in scope; PDO typically refers to products with a specific geographical origin whose quality and characteristics are directly linked to that region, while PGI can also include products from a broader area where the raw materials are produced.

The narrative clarifies that PGI status applies to English and Welsh spellings. It goes on to discuss how this cheese relies partly on tourism, which was affected during COVID. There's mention of local Caerphilly producers facing competition from mass-produced versions made in England, threatening their territorial identity because the traditional methods are more expensive.

The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation involving a return to pre-war cheesemaking processes—handmade cheese and local production within the town. It also touches on land use systems like grassland and local assets such as natural, social, and cultural aspects. Additionally, it notes that Caerphilly cheese is made in Somerset and Wiltshire in England.

Now, I need to determine if this involves PDO certification. The narrative specifically mentions PGI, not PDO. While both are forms of geographical protection under EU regulations, they're distinct. PDO is for products where the raw materials must be sourced from a specific area, whereas PGI allows broader sourcing but still requires some link to the region.

Since the cheese in question has PGI status and not PDO, it doesn't meet the criteria specified in the query. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2886 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that France VINIDEA is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC), and the reference card ID is VC 01 FR. It states that wine growing is the second largest agricultural activity in Savoyard agriculture, after milk production. Jongieux has six commercial wine producers and vineyards. The local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specific to products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods. Cheese like Roquefort or Parmigiano-Reggiano are examples with PDO status.

In the narrative, while there's discussion about milk production being significant, it doesn't explicitly mention cheese at all. The focus seems to be on wine growing as the second largest activity, with details about producers and vineyards. There's no indication that any cheese is part of this value chain, let alone whether it has PDO certification.

I should also consider if there are any indirect references. For instance, milk production could relate to cheese-making, but without specific mention of cheese or PDO, I can't assume that. The narrative doesn't provide enough information about the processing of milk into cheese or any certifications related to dairy products.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain in question involves cheese with PDO certification.

First, the narrative mentions "The Dão Demarcated Region was delimited in 1908, becoming the second demarcated wine region in Portugal." It talks about vineyards and specific grape varieties like Touriga Nacional, Encruzado, Alfrocheiro Preto, and Jaen. The product is described as having PDO certification, which stands for Protected Designation of Origin. 

The narrative also mentions that Dão Wine DOP - Serra da Estrela subregion can be produced in certain municipalities. However, the entire focus here seems to be on wine production, not cheese. There's no mention of cheese at all in the content provided.

I'm looking for any indication that the value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. Since the narrative is centered around wines and their production, including details about vineyards and winemaking processes, it doesn't touch upon dairy products or cheese. Therefore, there's no evidence to suggest that cheese with PDO certification is part of this mountain value chain.

So, based on the information given, the answer should be an empty JSON because the value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania and the reference card ID is VC 13 RO. It specifically talks about 'Brănză Horezu,' which was first produced in Horezu, a town in the mountainous region of northern Vâlcea County (RO415) back in 2001. The narrative also states that all milk used for cheese production is collected and mentions that authorization to use OQT has been granted, with labeling compliant with national regulations.

Now, I need to determine if 'Brănză Horezu' has PDO certification. From my knowledge, PDO is a European certification that protects food products based on their geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Products like certain cheeses, wines, and cured meats often have PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, it mentions OQT, which I believe stands for "Origin Quality Label." However, the key point here is whether 'Brănză Horezu' has been grantedPDO certification. The text says that authorization to use OQT was granted, but it doesn't explicitly mention PDO. 

I should consider if OQT and PDO are related or if one implies the other. In some cases, products with OQT might be on their way to obtaining PDO, but unless it's stated directly, I can't assume that. The narrative doesn't provide information about PDO certification specifically.

Therefore, based solely on the content given, there's no explicit mention of PDO certification for 'Brănză Horezu.' It only mentions OQT authorization and compliance with national regulations. Without more direct evidence, I shouldn't infer that PDO is involved.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the value chain has a reference card ID VC 38 CH2. It describes a beekeeper who produces and markets honey locally in small shops and online. The honey goes through a certification process related to grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets include natural resources.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specifically for agricultural products and foodstuffs that have traditional regional importance. It's about the specific geographical origin of the product and its unique characteristics tied to that region.

Looking at the narrative, it's all about honey production by a beekeeper. There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the text. The focus is on honey being sold locally and online, with certifications related to natural land and local assets. Since cheese isn't part of this value chain, there's no need to consider PDO certification for any dairy product here.

I should also make sure I'm not bringing in any external knowledge. The user specified that I should only use the content given as context. So, even if I know about Swiss cheeses like Gruyère or Emmental, which do have PDO status, they aren't mentioned in this narrative. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that cheese with PDO certification isn't involved here.

So, putting it all together, since the value chain is about honey and not cheese, the correct response should be an empty JSON object.

Looking further, there's data about the region's Gross Value Added (GVA) across different sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary. It also mentions the number of bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and the nearest large settlement. There are statistics on employment shares across sectors for both the province and the region.

The narrative then shifts to the production aspect, stating that cultivation is done exclusively in mountain areas. The product has a high reputation and strong demand from consumers and cosmetics companies for medicinal and aromatic plants and herbs. It's noted as a fast-growing market with mostly organic and nature-friendly production methods. Sales are direct or through e-commerce.

The challenges mentioned include dependency on altitude for beneficial plant metabolites, traditional knowledge, complex cropping issues like planting, fertilization, pest control, harvesting, drying, and storage problems. There's also difficulty in covering production costs and preserving Swiss mountain culture. The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation, involving cropland and local assets of natural and cultural significance.

The farm is a member of the VBKB association, which brings together organic medicinal plant producers in Swiss mountain regions.

Now, to determine if this involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification typically applies to products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort are examples with PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, the focus is on medicinal and aromatic plants, not dairy products or cheese. The production involves drying herbs and plants for presumably cosmetic or herbal uses, not cheese-making. There's no mention of milk processing, cheese production, or any dairy-related activities. Instead, it's about cultivating plants for their medicinal properties.

Additionally, the association mentioned (VBKB) is focused on organic medicinal plant producers, which further indicates that the product isn't cheese but rather herbs or similar products.

Therefore, since there's no indication of cheese being part of this value chain, especially not with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, with a specific VC ID. It talks about producers not necessarily being located in the mountains but associated with livestock farms aiming for diversification and valorization. The economic data includes shares of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, per capita income, GVA, and bed places in tourist accommodations. These stats give context about the region's economy but don't directly mention cheese or PDO.

Next, the narrative discusses meat production as a significant part of food production. It mentions that the value chain valorizes natural and symbolic values associated with the mountain region and is an example of an alternative food network. Farms process their products to add higher value, and meat products are attractive even to mainstream consumers. Producers are creating new marketing channels and using symbols like 'pure nature' and traditions in their branding.

The Sumava Mountains are described as picturesque, with a history of being partly abandoned during the socialist era but seeing farm renewals based on pre-WWII traditions. The region is tourist-friendly year-round, which producers use in their product names and descriptions to highlight symbolic resources.

Challenges include marketing and hygiene, but again, no mention of cheese or PDO certification.

Now, I'm looking for any clues about cheese with PDO. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods. The narrative focuses on meat production and the valorization of mountain symbols through branding and tourism. There's no explicit mention of cheese at all in the text.

Since the value chain is centered around meat products, not dairy or cheese, it's unlikely that PDO certification for cheese is involved here. PDO usually applies to agricultural products with a strong link to their origin, but without any reference to cheese, I can't assume it's part of this value chain.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2892 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy Vinidea, and the reference card ID is VC 33 IT. It talks about wine produced in the area having two appellations: PDO 5terre for a white wine made from local varieties like Bosco, Albarola, Vermentino, and another PDO called 5terre schiacchetra, which is a dessert wine. 

The focus here is on wine, not cheese. The narrative discusses processes related to new methods, land use systems as natural, and local assets including both natural and social aspects. There's no mention of cheese production or any dairy products at all. PDO certifications are mentioned for the wines, but since the question is about cheese with PDO certification, this doesn't apply.

Therefore, the value chain in narrative 2892 does not involve cheese with a PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Greece, specifically the region of Epirus. The actors include small animal husbandry farmers whose main income comes from milk production and a company called EPIRUS SA. 

Looking further down, it talks about Epirus Feta being a successful PDO product. It's described as the best-known Greek cheese with a territorial identity and traditional production methods. This already suggests that there is a PDO certification involved becausePDO products are known for their specific origin and traditional methods.

The narrative also mentions that sheep and goat farming is significant in the region, contributing to the local economy and culture. Epirus Feta's PDO status is highlighted, along with its export success and awards for taste and quality. This reinforces the idea that the cheese has a protected designation.

Additionally, the region is noted for its rugged mountainous terrain, which ties into the PDO criteria as the specific geographical location contributes to the unique characteristics of the product. The traditional animal husbandry customs further support the PDO aspects, as these methods are often part of what defines such products.

Putting it all together, the narrative explicitly mentions Epirus Feta having a PDO certification and describes its production in detail, which aligns with the criteria for a protected designation. Therefore, the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3051 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 11 ES. It talks about Huesca small vineyards and cellars located in higher mountain areas facing economic decline. The data includes various economic sectors' contributions to GVA (Gross Value Added) and employment shares, which are more about the region's economy but don't directly mention cheese.

Looking further, it discusses Huesca as a historic vineyard region with small productions that have identity value. There's an IGP (Indication Geographical Protected) for Ribera del Gállego-Cinco Villas wine. The narrative also talks about cooperation among producers, regaining old grape varieties, and issues related to climate change affecting grape growing.

In the latter part, it mentions the pre-Pirineos area where people from high mountains exchange products like cheese, meat, etc., with those from France and lowlands exchanging fruits and vegetables. The region is referred to as 'Reino de los Mallos.'

Now, I'm trying to see if any mention of cheese having PDO certification exists. PDO is a specific type of protected designation that applies to products with a traditional link to a particular region. While the narrative does talk about cheese being exchanged, it doesn't explicitly state whether this cheese has PDO certification.

The presence of an IGP for wine suggests there's some form of geographical protection, but that's for wine, not cheese. There's no specific mention of any cheese product receiving PDO status in the text. The focus seems more on vineyards and winemaking rather than dairy products.

Therefore, based solely on the provided narrative, there isn't enough information to confirm that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 48 ES. It talks about traditional charcoal making as an essential source of heat for cooking or heating. The region has a protected area, specifically the Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve, which supports the charcoal industry.

The narrative details various economic sectors' contributions to GVA (Gross Value Added) and employment in both the province and region. It also mentions that the primary sector shares are quite low, with tertiary being dominant. The number of tourist accommodations is given, but I don't see any mention of cheese or dairy products here.

The key part comes when it discusses the 'Asociación Charamusco Carboneros de la Cumbre' and their collaboration to register the brand CARBÓN DE LA CUMBRE. This focuses on sustainable charcoal production using local materials without chemicals. There's a challenge in making this small-scale, artisanal production sustainable against cheaper alternatives.

Looking through all the details provided, there's no mention of cheese at all. The value chain revolves around charcoal production, specifically CARBÓN DE LA CUMBRE, which is aiming for FSC certification but not PDO. PDO typically applies to food products like cheeses, wines, etc., where origin and traditional methods are crucial.

Since the narrative doesn't discuss any cheese or dairy products, it's clear that this mountain value chain isn't about cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 15 SCA. The value chain is based on a family farm with few employees besides the two owners. They produce herbs and flowers, selling them fresh and dry. Additionally, they own a dehumidifier, which I assume is used for drying or preserving these products.

The narrative also notes that more cases of organic herb farms are located in Roros (NO1640) and Gloppen (NO1445). Nowhere in this text is there any mention of cheese. The focus seems to be entirely on herbs and flowers, their production, and the tools they use for drying.

Since PDO certification specifically relates to products like cheese, wine, or other food items that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods. Without any reference to cheese in the narrative, it's clear that this value chain doesn't involve such products.

Therefore, I should output an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2914 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is NMK, which I'm not familiar with, but it's probably an abbreviation for a country. The process described starts with tobacco seeds, planting seedlings, harvesting, selling raw material, processing, and then selling the final product to end users. It also includes natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if cheese is involved here. The narrative talks about tobacco products, from seeds through to the final processed product. There's no mention of dairy products, milk, or any kind of cheese-making process. PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products like cheeses, wines, or cured meats that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods.

Since the entire chain is focused on tobacco, which isn't a dairy product, it doesn't involve cheese at all. Therefore, there's no possibility of PDO-certified cheese being part of this value chain. 

I should also consider if "natural" aspects might relate to cheese, but in this context, it's more about the agricultural process of growing and processing tobacco. So, even with natural elements, it doesn't tie into cheese production.

In conclusion, the mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification because the entire focus is on tobacco products.

The forest covers a very large part of the Jura mountain (together with the pastures) and therefore represents a large prevalence of landuse systems. The forest area should not be reduced in favour of built-up or agricultural area, as it is extremely protected in Switzerland. The sustainable development of the forest is therefore extremely important for the development of the Swiss Jura mountains.   Forests are a local asset and depend strongly on natural conditions (change in rainfall, temperature, soils, slope, etc.). In Switzerland, forests are managed by legal bases guaranteeing sustainable exploitation in the framework of forestry planning.    Wood production is threatened by natural hazards such as drought increased by climate change (in addition to the shallow, calcareous soil), as well as the bark beetle. A major transformation in the composition of forests is expected. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the narrative provided.

The narrative ID is 3136. It mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland and talks about various sectors contributing to the GVA, which stands for Gross Value Added. The primary sector contributes 0.86%, secondary 38.65%, and tertiary 60.49%. There's also mention of tourist accommodations with bed places and agricultural holdings.

The narrative goes into detail about forests covering a large part of the Jura mountains, their protection, sustainable development, challenges like climate change affecting wood production, and land use systems focused on forestry. It mentions natural assets and political norms as local assets but doesn't specifically talk about cheese or dairy products at all.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese, especially with PDO certification. PDO is a specific type of protected status that usually applies to agricultural products, including cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Gruyère. Since the narrative focuses on forestry and wood production, there's no indication that dairy or cheese processing is part of this value chain.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

The remoteness of the area make it difficult for the active part of the population to share formal and informal knowledges and experiences that can promote the valorisation of local natural (busheses, woods, and natural grass land) and human (traditional know-how) resources .

For these reasons, producers are exploring alternative marketing strategies besides local markets, such as e-commerce and on farm selling (usually coupled with agritourism actvities). The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is present within the two mountain areas present in the Province of Foggia (NUTS3: ) ('Gargano' and 'Monti Dauni').

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the cheese is produced using milk from the 'Podolica' cow, which is a local breed. It also talks about traditional processing methods and the challenges faced due to the remote area, such as an aging population and depopulation affecting knowledge sharing. The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with innovation related to new marketing strategies like e-commerce and on-farm sales.

Now, I'm trying to recall what PDO certification entails. From what I know, PDO is a designation given to products that have specific characteristics due to their geographical origin and traditional production methods. So, if the cheese in question uses local breeds, traditional methods, and has unique geographical features, it might qualify for PDO.

Looking at the narrative again, it does mention traditional activities and local natural resources, which are factors often considered for PDO. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that the cheese has PDO certification. It only describes the production methods and challenges without mentioning any specific certifications or designations.

Since there's no direct reference to PDO in the narrative, I can't confirm that the cheese has such certification. Therefore, according to the instructions, if it doesn't involve cheese with PDO, I should return an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2882 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the main activities are breeding Limousine beef cattle and recovering an old variety of corn called 'ottofile'. The products listed include meat from veal and heifer, but there's no mention of cheese at all. PDO certification typically applies to dairy products like cheese, wines, or certain meats, often in European contexts.

Looking further, the narrative talks about promoting the territory and sustainable agricultural practices but doesn't specify any cheese production. The sectors involved are primary (agriculture), secondary (processing), and tertiary (services). However, without a specific mention of cheese processing or PDO certification, I can't assume it's there.

The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, focusing on new marketing strategies and governance systems. But again, no indication that cheese with PDO is part of this chain. The emphasis seems to be more on meat production and environmental sustainability rather than dairy products.

So, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that cheese with PDO certification is involved in this mountain value chain.

The narrative does not mention cheese or any product with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. It focuses on meat production and traditional agricultural practices without reference to dairy products.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the VC ID is 05 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in open pastures during summer and being covered by snow the rest of the year. The region has protected areas, which might be relevant for PDO since such designations often require specific geographic regions.

Looking at the economic data: primary sector contributes 3.65% to GVA, secondary 23.37%, tertiary 72.98%. Tourism seems significant with 3704 bed places and a regional share of 14.53%. The narrative also mentions that besides cultural aspects, the VC is important for conserving mountain pastures. It adds value through tourism assets and marketing via regional brands and e-commerce.

The challenges include competition from meat industry, adding value due to lower production capacity, and climate change impacts. Innovations involve exogenous changes like touristic packages and rural development projects with websites and e-commerce.

Nowhere in the narrative is cheese explicitly mentioned. The focus seems more on tourism, pasture management, and economic sectors rather than specific dairy products or certifications like PDO. There's no mention of cheese production, brands, or any indication that a product has PDO status.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3161 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Turkey, with the VC ID being VC 14 TR. It talks about dairy cattle enterprises being small scale and cows grazing in highlands, which suggests a traditional or local method of cheese production. The main livelihood for households comes from livestock, which ties into their economic reliance on dairy products.

The cheeses specifically mentioned are Kars Gruyere and Kashar. I know that PDO certification is given to products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. So, I should check if these cheeses have such certifications.

Kars Gruyere: I recall that Gruyère is a type of cheese originally from Switzerland, but there are other regions producing similar cheeses under different names. However, for it to be PDO certified, the specific region in Turkey where Kars Gruyere is made would need to meet EU standards if they're exporting to Europe.

Kashar: This is another cheese I'm familiar with, often associated with Balkan countries like Serbia and Turkey. Kashar typically has a PDO status in some regions. For example, Serbian Kashar has PDO certification. But does the Turkish version also have it? That's something I need to verify.

Looking at the narrative again, it doesn't explicitly state whether these cheeses have PDO certification. It just mentions they are the most-produced cheeses and lists some states that produce similar cheeses, like Serbia and Switzerland. However, without explicit mention of PDO in the narrative, I can't assume it.

Wait, but sometimesPDO status is implied if a cheese is traditionally made in a specific region with protected methods. Since Kars Gruyere and Kashar are traditional Turkish cheeses, especially Kashar being mentioned alongside countries that have PDO versions, maybe they do have it. But the narrative doesn't say so directly.

I think I need to stick strictly to the information given. The narrative doesn't mention anything about certifications like PDO. It only talks about production methods and the types of cheese produced. Therefore, based solely on this content, there's no evidence that these cheeses have PDO certification.

So, since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that the cheeses involved have PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the syrups are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative is about a value chain (VC) in the Czech Republic, specifically VC 15 CZ. It mentions that syrup producers are involved, collecting ingredients from mountain regions but processing them nearby. There's a lot of data on GVA, employment sectors, and tourism accommodations, but I'm more interested in whether cheese or any dairy products with PDO certification are part of this chain.

The narrative describes the VC as focusing on producing syrups with various flavors. These syrups use herbs and fruits from the mountains and reference traditional recipes. They're marketed as a regional product, leveraging cultural traits and symbolic values associated with the mountain area. The challenge here is about marketing and valorization rather than anything related to cheese or PDO certification.

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention cheese, dairy products, or any specifics about certifications like PDO. It's all about syrups made from mountain ingredients. Even though they're trying to create a unique selling proposition by emphasizing regional and cultural aspects, there's no indication that this involves cheese with any special designation.

So, based on the information given, the value chain is centered around syrup production, not cheese. Therefore, it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, let me try to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3130 involves cheese with PDO certification. First, I'll read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions a family farm that produces yogurt directly on the farm and sells it locally. They also supply local cheese dairies. The products are labeled 'IP S' but there's no mention of any specific certification like PDO. 

PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, which is a label given to products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. For example, cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort have PDO certifications.

Looking at the details, the farm uses milk from Swiss breeds of goats—Graubünden and Appenzell—which are part of ProSpecieRara, a foundation that supports heritage and genetic diversity. This adds to the product's uniqueness but doesn't necessarily mean it has a PDO certification.

The narrative talks about the challenges faced by the value chain due to climate change affecting pastures and milk production. It also mentions that the VC is classified as both traditional and innovative, with innovation in new products. However, there's no explicit mention of any certifications or labels beyond 'IP S,' which isn't a PDO.

Since the content doesn't specify that the cheese has a PDO certification, I can conclude that it doesn't involve such a certification.

PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products and foodstuffs that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Examples include certain types of cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

The new products they market include apples (fresh, jams, juices), and they've implemented organic farming practices.

Nowhere in the narrative is there a mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus seems to be on apple-based products, beer, and other agricultural goods. There's no indication that Melise deals with cheese production or any related activities. Additionally, PDO certification typically applies to specific food products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) where the origin and traditional methods are protected.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, it's safe to conclude that the mountain value chain in question does not involve cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The narrative mentions Corsica and an association called Casgiu Casanu, which has been around since 1998. They focus on on-farm cheese making using dairy goats and ewes. It talks about requalifying husbandry to regulate socioecological systems and uses local resources like breeds and feeding species.

Now, I know that PDO certification is a mark of quality that protects food products with distinct characteristics due to their geographical origin. For example, Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort cheese have PDO status. So, for the cheese in question to have PDO, it should be specifically tied to a region and have unique production methods.

Looking at the narrative, while they mention cheese production and local traditions, there's no explicit mention of any certification like PDO. They talk about reassembling resources and using local breeds but don't specify that their cheeses meet the criteria for PDO. There's also no reference to any specific protected status or EU recognition, which is usually required for PDO.

Therefore, based solely on the information given, I can't confirm that the cheese in this value chain has PDO certification. The narrative focuses more on traditional methods and local practices without indicating any formal certifications.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Hungary, with the VC 19 HU as the card ID. It talks about a monastery of Cistercian Sisters in Kismaros processing their own fruit and making jams and syrups from purchased raw materials. They're also looking into new marketing strategies. The land use systems and local assets are noted as N/A.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specific to certain products that have a traditional link with a particular region or country. Cheese with PDO would typically be mentioned explicitly, especially since it's a protected status.

Looking at the narrative, the focus is on fruit processing— jams and syrups. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese, or any indication that they're involved in cheesemaking. The monastery is processing their own fruit, which suggests their main products are fruit-based rather than dairy-based.

Since there's no information about cheese at all in the narrative, it's safe to conclude that this value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, I should output an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3082 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that there are six main types of cheeses in the area, shared across three provinces. It specifically highlights blue cheeses from this region, noting that they stand out nationwide and even compete internationally. The regions listed include various municipalities like Cabezón de Liébana, Camaleño, etc., all within Spain.

I know that PDO certification is a mark of quality and authenticity for food products, especially cheeses, which are produced in specific regions following traditional methods. Many famous cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort have PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, it talks about blue cheeses being significant. Blue cheeses often have strong flavors and are sometimes associated with specific regions. For example, Roquefort is a well-known blue cheese with an PDO certification from France. However, in this case, the cheeses are from Spain, specifically mentioned as being from provinces that include Cantabria (like Posada de Valdeón) and possibly others.

I'm trying to recall if there's a Spanish blue cheese with PDO status. One that comes to mind is "Queso de Cabrales," which is a blue-veined cheese produced in the Asturias region of Spain. It does have a PDO certification, so if the cheeses mentioned include Cabrales or something similar, then it would qualify.

The narrative lists several municipalities but doesn't explicitly name any specific cheese types beyond being blue cheeses. However, given that they are from these regions and considering the prominence of Queso de Cabrales in Spain, it's plausible that the cheeses involved have PDO certification.

Therefore, based on the context provided, I can infer that the mountain value chain does involve cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin certification.

Okay, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2978 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and VC 19 UK as the card ID. It talks about over 130 distilleries producing whisky in Scotland, noting that Scotch Whisky is a PDO product. The key points here are that 'Scotch' must be distilled and matured in Scotland, which aligns with PDO requirements.

The narrative goes on to discuss various economic indicators like per capita income, GVA, sector shares, bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and the nearest large settlement. These details don't directly mention cheese but focus more on whisky production and tourism.

Further down, it explicitly states that Scotch Whisky has PDO status and is highly regarded globally. It mentions exports worth £4.9 billion, contributing significantly to Scotland's economy, employment figures, and its role in food and drink tourism. The narrative also discusses natural assets like clean water, peat, and barley, as well as social and cultural assets related to the whisky industry.

There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the narrative. The focus is entirely on Scotch Whisky, its production, economic impact, sustainability efforts, and tourism aspects. Since cheese isn't discussed, it doesn't involve any PDO-certified cheese products.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3134 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that it's a small-scale farming operation where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk into cheese, which they sell directly on the farm. The processing happens on-site, which suggests a traditional method. 

Switzerland is known for its cheeses like Gruyère and Emmental, many of which have PDO certifications. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention any specific cheese names or certifications. It talks about organic production meeting environmental standards and the artisanal transformation of milk into cheese using traditional knowledge.

I'm trying to recall if just making cheese on a small scale automatically grants it a PDO status. From what I know, PDO certification requires specific geographical origins and traditional methods, but it's not automatic. The narrative does mention that the cheese is produced in an artisanal way with traditional knowledge, which aligns with PDO criteria. However, without explicit mention of the certification or the specific cheese name tied to a region, I can't be certain.

The value chain is described as Traditional and there are uncertainties about climate change impacts, but nothing about certifications. So while it's possible that the cheese could have PDO status given the traditional methods and geographical location, the narrative doesn't provide enough information to confirm this.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding PDO Requirements:** PDO certification requires specific geographical origin and traditional production methods.

2. **Analyzing Narrative Content:** The narrative describes small-scale farming producing cheese from sheep's milk using traditional methods but doesn't mention any specific certifications or cheese names tied to a region.

3. **Conclusion:** Without explicit mention of PDO certification, it cannot be confirmed that the cheese in this value chain has such status.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given narrative involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative has an ID of 2836. It mentions that the reference member state is Hungary, and the reference card ID is VC 11 HU. The activities described include logging for firewood, sawmill operations, and a nearby thermal power plant. There's also mention of replantation and maintenance of the forest. The narrative describes these as traditional mountain activities complemented by building wood to a thermal power plant, which is considered innovative.

The land use systems involved are forestry, and the local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products that have specific geographical origins and traditional production methods. Cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort are examples of such products.

Looking at the narrative, the activities revolve around forestry—logging, sawmills, thermal power plants. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese production, or anything related to agriculture beyond forestry. The focus is on wood and energy generation from a thermal power plant, not on food or dairy industries.

Since there's no indication that cheese or any dairy product is part of this value chain, especially one with PDO certification, I can conclude that the narrative does not involve such cheese.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The narrative describes a value chain focused on forestry activities in Hungary, including logging, sawmills, and energy production from a thermal power plant.

2. **Look for PDO Cheese Indicators:** PDO certification is relevant to agricultural products with specific geographical origins. The narrative does not mention any dairy or cheese-related activities.

3. **Conclusion:** Since the value chain revolves around forestry and energy, there's no involvement of cheese with PDO certification.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. It mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE, and the value chain (VC) has an ID of VC 04 FR. There are 20 dairies collecting milk from about 300 dairy farmers, including both Ewe and Goat farmers. Some of these farmers make their own cheese, specifically mentioning "cheese two." The narrative also talks about how dairies might not be located in mountainous areas but collect milk there, influencing the socioeconomic aspects.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is a mark of quality and authenticity, typically for agricultural products that meet specific regional standards. For example, cheeses like Roquefort or Camembert have PDO status in France.

Looking at the narrative, it mentions cheese production but doesn't explicitly state whether it'sPDO-certified. It refers to "cheese two," which might be a typo or a specific local term, but without more context, I can't assume it's a PDO product. The mention of France INRAE suggests a research or agricultural focus, but again, there's no direct link to PDO certification.

Since the narrative doesn't provide any information about certifications like PDO, I can't confirm that cheese with such certification is involved in this value chain. Therefore, according to the instructions, if there's no mention of PDO cheese, the output should be an empty JSON.

It is very well-known by local tourists and is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/pastrama-oaie-stana-stefanu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Pastrama de Oaie' is the semi-natural and alpine grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing) in the mountain areas of Gorj County (RO412). Many of the communal pastures used for grazing sheep and cattle are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and associated dairy products and the consumption of sheepmeat is steadily declining due to changing consumer preferences. 'Pastrama de Oaie' continues to maintain a very specific niche in the market since it is very seasonal and especially sought after for traditional summer barbecues / grills. However, products such as this rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are an increasing number of specialist butcher shops looking for good quality local meat products), but this also brings additional challenges for traditional small-scale businesses - including compliance with food hygiene and safety rules.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Romania and the VC ID is VC 14 RO. The product in question is 'Pastrama de Oaie', which is made from boneless mutton, preserved and smoked with a special recipe. It's produced by a family farm in Gorj County and is registered as a Mountain Product under Romania's Optional Quality Term (OQT). 

I know that PDO certification is a specific type of protected status for food products, usually indicating that the product has a traditional link to a specific region and its quality is tied to local factors. The narrative mentions OQT, which stands for Optional Quality Term. I'm not entirely sure if OQT is the same as PDO, but I think they are related in some way.

Looking further, it says Romania has been active in developing OQT for mountain products. 'Pastrama de Oaie' is registered under this system and recognized as a Mountain Product with a link to the website provided. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that it's PDO certified; it just mentions OQT.

I'm trying to recall if OQT is a different designation or part of the PDO framework. From what I remember, PDO is a European Union certification, and OQT might be a national term used by Romania for similar products. So, maybe 'Pastrama de Oaie' doesn't have PDO certification but has an equivalent under Romania's system.

Since the narrative doesn't mention PDO specifically, even though it's a quality product with a protected status, I think the answer should be that it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The narrative mentions that there are three cheese producers in the Nivegy-valley micro-region. They produce high-quality artisan cheeses and milk products.

Looking at the types of innovation mentioned: endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous innovations usually come from within the community, while exogenous might involve external influences or technologies. They use small machinery, solar power, ICT for marketing, which suggests they're modernizing their methods.

The narrative doesn't explicitly mention anything about PDO certification. PDO is a specific EU certification that protects food products with unique characteristics due to their geographical environment and traditional production methods. For cheese, this often involves strict regulations on ingredients, production processes, and the region where it's made.

In the text, while they talk about high-quality products and traditional animal husbandry, there's no mention of any specific certifications like PDO. They do have innovative aspects in packaging, marketing via the internet, and use of technology, but again, nothing about PDO.

Some farms are trying to certify their farm process and refer to a specific quality scheme. However, these examples are quite rare.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the narrative provided.

The narrative ID is 2761, and it's about a value chain in the Czech Republic, specifically mentioning the Sumava region. It talks about chicken husbandry on farms located in the mountain area. There are some statistics about per capita income, GVA (Gross Value Added), sector shares, bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and proximity to settlements.

The key part here is the discussion of the primary activities in the value chain. The narrative mentions that chicken production belongs to small-scale farms in Sumava. These farms are linked to urban areas due to high demand for chicken meat, which they supply through niche markets competing with larger industrial farms. Some farms are trying to certify their processes under specific quality schemes, but these are rare.

Now, the question is whether this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification typically applies to products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production, ensuring quality and authenticity. Cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort are examples with PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, it's focused on chicken meat production, not dairy products or cheese. There's no mention of cheese being part of this value chain. The farms are specialized in chicken husbandry and meat production, not milk or cheese. While some farms are trying to get certifications for their processes, these seem to be about quality schemes related to meat production, not PDO specifically for cheese.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't reference any dairy-related activities, such as milk processing or cheese-making. The focus is on chicken meat, its production, and marketing strategies. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain at all.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the narrative, there's no evidence to suggest that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

The focus seems to be on timber exploitation in Switzerland, specifically stopping at the canton of Jura but extending beyond with different forest compositions.

Now, I need to check if this narrative involves cheese. The key terms here are "timber exploitation" and "forest owners." There's no mention of dairy products, cheese production, or any agricultural activities related to cheese-making. PDO certification is typically associated with specific food products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) that have a geographical origin and traditional methods.

Since the narrative doesn't discuss anything related to cheese or dairy, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain. Therefore, the mountain value chain described here doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention that I might be missing. The narrative talks about processing and sales companies, but without specific details on what they process or sell, it's safe to assume based on the given information that cheese isn't involved.

In conclusion, the value chain is centered around timber and forestry, not dairy products. Hence, the output should be an empty JSON as specified.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if a given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the "id" of the narrative; otherwise, I'll return an empty JSON.

First, let's understand what a mountain value chain is. Typically, this refers to a sequence of processes and actors involved in producing and delivering goods from a specific mountainous region. These chains often focus on local products that have unique characteristics due to their geographical origin.

Now, the key here is whether the narrative mentions cheese with PDO certification. PDO is a label used in the European Union for products that have a specific quality linked to their place of production. So, if the product in question is cheese and it's certified under PDO, then we need to include its ID in the JSON.

Looking at the provided narrative:

ID Narrative: 2857
The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 IT. The VC is not dependent on other SES for its production process. Relevant actor is the family farmer who produce white garlic and herbs in mountain area. They use sustainable packaging. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and social.

Alright, let's break this down. The value chain involves a family farmer producing white garlic and herbs in a mountain area. They mention using sustainable packaging and that the innovation relates to the entire VC. Land use is cropland, with natural and social assets involved.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or any dairy product. It's focused on garlic and herbs. PDO certification is specifically for products like certain cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) that have a unique origin and specific production methods. Since the narrative doesn't reference cheese at all, there's no indication of PDO-certified cheese being part of this value chain.

Therefore, since the product isn't cheese and there's no mention of any PDO certification related to cheese, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The Value Chain ID is VC 50 IT. The farm has 35 cows of specific breeds, and their main product is 'Formai de Ceresegn' cheese, which is aged from one to... well, it doesn't specify the exact aging period here.

Looking further, there's a lot about sector shares in employment but nothing directly related to PDO certification. The narrative does talk about cheese being excellent gustatorily and nutritionally, mentioning high-quality proteins, minerals like phosphorus and calcium, and vitamins A and B2. It also notes that innovation is starting to spread in this traditional value chain, with key assets being the natural grasslands and meadows in the Alps, along with traditional dairy production knowledge.

The cheese is described as having a superior nutritional profile because the animals graze on pasture-fed herbs rich in various bioactive compounds. The challenges are current, and it's classified as a Traditional Value Chain. Innovation relates to the whole VC but isn't specified further. Land use systems include grassland and natural land, with local assets being natural.

Now, I need to determine if 'Formai de Ceresegn' cheese has PDO certification. PDO is a specific certification that denotes products originating in a specific region, with traditional methods ensuring quality and authenticity. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention PDO or any similar certification like AOP (Appellation d'Origine Protégée) in France.

However, the mention of 'Formai de Ceresegn' makes me think about whether this is a known cheese with such certification. From my general knowledge, some Italian cheeses do have PDO status, but I'm not certain if Formai de Ceresegn does. The narrative doesn't provide any direct evidence or mention of certifications.

Since the user instructed to use only the content given and avoid external knowledge, I can't assume based on real-world information. Therefore, without explicit mention in the narrative, I shouldn't infer that it has PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3019 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 13 SCA. The example given is a raspberry farm called Veiseth. They offer picking your own raspberries, selling fresh or frozen raspberries, and raspberry juice. There's some data about economic indicators like GVA (Gross Value Added) for different sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary—and employment shares across these sectors.

The narrative also talks about the primary asset of this value chain being the cooperation between producers under an association called AUK - SMAKER FRA STJØRDALSFØRET. They focus on sustainability and natural assets like berries. The challenges include competition from greenhouse production, larger companies, imports, and potential issues due to global warming affecting their organic, unsprayed raspberry production.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of cheese or dairy products. It's all about raspberries—how they're grown, harvested, sold as fresh, frozen, or processed into juice. The association seems to be centered around berry production and related products. There's no indication that the value chain involves any cheese-making process, let alone one that would require PDO certification.

PDO certification is typically for agricultural products and foodstuffs that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. For example, certain cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort have PDO status. But in this case, the focus is entirely on raspberries and their derivatives, not cheese.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative ID is 2762. The main focus seems to be on a social enterprise in the Czech Republic that deals with healing herbs. They collect these herbs from local meadows and process them into herbal teas. The enterprise has an e-shop for distribution and employs socially disadvantaged groups, particularly Roma people, which ties into social inclusion.

Looking through the details, I see mentions of regional labels and sustainable practices. The herbs are described as being used for centuries in healing, and they're leveraging the natural resources from remote mountain areas to meet current market demands for natural products.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on herbs and their processing into teas. There's no indication that any part of this value chain involves cheese production or any product that would require PDO certification related to cheese.

PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products and foodstuffs, including cheeses, wines, and certain meats, which have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Since the narrative doesn't touch on cheese at all, it's clear that this value chain isn't about cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence to suggest that cheese with PDO certification is part of this mountain value chain.

The narrative does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. It focuses on healing herbs and their processing into teas by a social enterprise.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2982 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and a Value Chain ID of VC 23 UK. It talks about winter sports at Lecht ski resort, focusing on land maintenance during summer to preserve the area for skiing. There's data on GVA (Gross Value Added) across different sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary—and some specifics about bed places in tourist accommodations and agricultural holdings.

The narrative also discusses employment sector shares and mentions protected areas in the region. It highlights successful registration of quality schemes, high-quality products with a good reputation, and the importance of land use systems and natural assets. There's an example given about a wind-powered snow factory as both a new product and process using renewable energy.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus seems to be on tourism, specifically winter sports like skiing, and the associated economic factors such as GVA, employment sectors, and community relations. There's no indication that cheese is part of the value chain, let alone whether it has PDO certification.

PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products and foodstuffs, especially cheeses, wines, and cured meats, which have a specific geographical origin and traditional production methods. Since the narrative doesn't touch on any dairy-related activities or products, I can confidently say that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this mountain value chain.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria, and the VC ID is 06 AT. It talks about farms using their own or wild fruits to market products individually through various channels like on-farm shops, internet, local gastronomy, and regional shops. The primary sector employment in the province is around 11.55%, secondary at 29.94%, and tertiary at 58.50%. Similarly, for the region, those percentages are 5.55%, 26.47%, and 67.99% respectively.

The narrative then goes into detail about traditional fine brandies and liqueurs made from wild fruits, specifically mentioning rowanberry brandy made from mountain ash berries. It also notes that some distilleries offer guided tours with tastings. Schnaps is a traditional product in Austria, but this initiative stands out because farmers are creating various unusual types of drinks.

The high-quality products align with the 'Genussregion Almenland', which promotes local food specialties and quality standards set by AgrarMarkt Austria. They also enrich the tourist program through guided tours and tastings. The challenges mentioned include climate change affecting vegetation, impacting both wild plants and fruit cultivation for schnaps. The VC is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types. It highlights innovative products like a variety of high-quality brandies and liqueurs, along with new marketing strategies.

The land use systems involved are natural land and orchards, with local assets being natural and cultural. Many farms in Austria distil fruits, both cultivated and wild, often adhering to high quality standards.

Now, I need to determine if cheese is part of this value chain, specifically cheese with PDO certification. The narrative doesn't mention cheese at all; instead, it focuses on brandies, liqueurs, schnaps, and other alcoholic beverages made from fruits. There's no reference to dairy products or cheese production. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) where the specific origin and traditional methods are protected.

Since the narrative is centered around fruit-based distillates and doesn't touch on cheese, I can conclude that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this mountain value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The gofio of the Canary Islands is a product elaborated mainly from millet or wheat. Its origin is Berber, and the aborigines of the Canary Islands mostly consumed it. In ancient times, different types of gofio were made using ingredients such as wheat, lentils, barley, and even fern rhizomes. After the Canary Islands' conquest, the variety of cereals grew, since until then, only wheat and barley were used. After the discovery of America, it also began to be made with corn or millet. Some mills have outstanding heritage resources related to the history of gofio production. Others, such as the Molino del Fuego in Telde, are more than one hundred years old. There is a whole cultural and social tradition around gofio in the gastronomy and food of the Canary Islands that has spread to other South American and African countries.   Paradoxically, almost all the raw material are grown abroad. Thus, many mills use mixtures of cereals grown outside the islands or send the local millet seed to distant countries such as Argentina, from where they then receive the grain. The small area of millet grown in the municipality of Telde is often used as cattle feed. In some cases, such as in the Biosphere Reserve on the island of La Palma, a social initiative carries out the entire process. The Canary Islands Government has declared 'El Molino del Conde,' located in Telde, Gran Canaria, an Asset of Cultural Interest.    Consumption seems to remain stable, and even the catering industry and other processed foods are beginning to introduce gofio flour in their offer, while production by the mills remains stable.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain with ID 3066 and wants me to determine if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully to identify any mentions related to cheese or PDO certification. The narrative starts by talking about Spain's Canary Islands and their traditional product called gofio. Gofio is made from cereals like millet or wheat and has a historical background. It mentions different types of mills and cultural traditions around it.

I'll look for keywords like "cheese," "PDO," "Protected Designation of Origin," or any specific cheese names. The narrative discusses gofio, which is a flour product, not cheese. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese-making processes, or certifications related to cheese in the text.

Additionally, the narrative focuses on the production and consumption of gofio, its historical significance, and some challenges in sourcing raw materials. It also talks about mills and cultural initiatives but doesn't touch upon cheese at all.

Since there's no information about cheese or any PDO certification for cheese in the provided content, I can conclude that this value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if a given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the "id" of the narrative; otherwise, I'll return an empty JSON.

First, let's understand what PDO certification is. PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, which is a label given to products that have specific characteristics due to their geographical location and traditional methods. For example, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese has PDO certification because it's made in a specific region in Italy using traditional recipes.

Now, looking at the narrative provided:

ID Narrative: 2863
The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 IT. The VC does not depend on other SESs, and the main actors are farmers and the municipality of Amatrice. The VC has a positive impact on the SES (e.g., preserving the municipality of Amatrice. The intent is to allow greater competitiveness of local mountain farms by preserving and promoting a historical local food (the honey) to attract consumers interested in the local cultural tradition on wine and food productions. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.

Okay, so the narrative talks about a value chain involving Italy, specifically mentioning UNIMOL and UNIPI, which I believe are universities or research institutions. The main actors are farmers and the municipality of Amatrice. The purpose is to enhance the competitiveness of local mountain farms by preserving and promoting a historical local food—honey.

Wait, it says "the honey" as the historical local food. So, they're focusing on honey production here. Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese. It's all about honey. They want to attract consumers interested in local wine and food productions, but again, no mention of cheese.

So, since the value chain is centered around honey, not cheese, there's no indication that cheese with PDO certification is involved. Therefore, I shouldn't include any JSON object because the criteria aren't met.

I should also make sure I'm only using the content provided in the narrative and not adding any external knowledge. The example given in the problem shows how to structure the JSON if it does involve cheese with PDO, but since this doesn't apply here, the correct response is an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2841 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the business is run by a chemical engineer couple who farm with their family. They produce and sell wine, specifically Chardonna. The products are organic and include wines, juices, vegetables, and fruits. They market these items directly through their webshop, social media, hotels, restaurants in the area, and Budapest.

Nowhere in this description do they mention cheese or any dairy products. The focus is on wine, organic vegetables, fruits, and juices. There's no indication that cheese is part of their production line. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses, wines, or other food items with specific regional origins. Since the narrative doesn't reference cheese at all, it seems clear that cheese isn't involved in this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no mention of cheese, especially not one with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.99%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.61%.   Fly fishing is a traditional practice in Scandinavia due to the water streams that fow along its mountains and valleys with clean and cold water. These characteristics are important for the VC as trouts and other salmonid fishes find in these waters their natural habitat.   The natural assets are the five rivers and 18 lakes where fly fishing can be practiced in Hemsedal. All of them are healthy ecosystems with high quality waters, which make them ideal habitats for trouts. The social assets are all the values that underpin this activity regarding respect for the animals and their habitats, the use of specific techniques and tools and proper behaviour. Finally, fly fishing represents a traditional practice for many anglers that have learnt it from the previous generations and have been doing it during their whole lives.    Climate change may be the main challenge for this VC. Water streams in Nordic areas are expected to suffer more floods and changes in water temperature with the consequent impact on the micro biota and biochemical processes that occur in water. Therefore, water quality and biochemical parameters may change, thus altering the whole water ecosystem. Trouts and salmons are the main fish species for fly fishing in this area. Although both are quite sensible to these changes, trouts are lower thermal tolerance, hence being more vulnerable under this scenario. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3018 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 12 SCA. The fishing season runs from May to September, attracting anglers. There's a Hemsedal Fishing Association involved, which suggests it's related to fishing activities.

Looking at the economic data, the primary sector contributes only 1.02% in the province and 1.39% in the region. The secondary sector is around 18-21%, and tertiary is dominant at 80-80%. This indicates that the local economy is mostly service-oriented, which makes sense for a tourist destination.

The narrative talks about fly fishing as a traditional practice in Scandinavia because of the clean mountain streams. It mentions specific rivers and lakes where trout and salmon are found. The social assets include respect for habitats and proper behavior, indicating sustainable practices but nothing about cheese production.

There's no mention of agriculture beyond the number of holdings, which is 2111. However, since the primary sector is so low, it suggests that while there might be some farming, it's not a significant part of the economy here. Cheese production would typically fall under the secondary sector, but the numbers don't show a high contribution from manufacturing.

The challenges mentioned are climate-related and focus on water ecosystems affecting trout and salmon. Again, this is about fishing, not dairy or cheese. There's no discussion of cheese at all in the narrative.

Since PDO certification applies to products like cheese that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods, but there's no indication here that cheese is part of this value chain. The focus is entirely on fishing, particularly fly fishing, which relies on the natural water resources.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Slovakia, with a specific card ID VC 07 SK. The activities listed are herbs production, collection of wild herbs and forest fruits. Key actors include managers, workers, and consumers. Positive impacts on local and regional SES (Socio-Economic Systems) are noted, particularly in employment statistics across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors.

Looking at the quality certificates, they mention ecological production, organic farming, and quality marks for herbs, fruits, and tea mixtures. The farm has received awards for being a beautiful farm and for company turnover. Natural assets include clean mountain environments, meadows, forests, and cropland for herbs. Social assets involve recognition of organic farming and willingness to pay more for bio-quality products. Cultural assets relate to traditional knowledge about local plants and sustainable agricultural practices.

Challenges mentioned are climate change affecting herb quality, the need for more handwork due to organic production, shorter storage life requiring frequent processing, and strict control throughout production stages. The VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous species of herbs and fruits processed in bio-quality. Land use systems include cropland and forestry.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on herbs, forest fruits, and their organic production. There's no indication that the value chain involves cheese at all, let alone one with PDO certification. PDO typically applies to products like cheeses where specific regional factors contribute to unique characteristics, but since there's no cheese mentioned here, I can confidently say it doesn't involve such a product.

Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania and the reference card ID is VC 11 RO. It talks about cheeses, specifically 'Brânză de Burduf', being marketed under the brand 'Stâna de Vaideeni'. These cheeses are produced in a licensed processing unit in a village.

Next, it mentions that all products must be registered as 'Mountain Products', which strictly requires them to originate from within a designated mountain area, reducing the distance to 0km. The National Mountain Area Agency is responsible for coordinating the OQT (which I assume stands for Origin Quality Tag) and maintaining the National Registry of Mountain Products. There's also mention of 30 Mountain Development Offices that handle processing and approval of requests to use the OQT locally.

The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether these cheeses have PDO certification. However, it does talk about a specific quality tag (OQT) and strict origin requirements, which are hallmarks of PDO certification. PDO typically requires that products not only come from a specific region but also follow traditional methods and have a unique quality due to the region's environment.

Since the narrative emphasizes the geographical specificity and the controlled production process under the OQT system, it's likely that these cheeses do have PDO certification. Therefore, I should include the ID of this narrative in the JSON response.

However, strong connections with local agricultural production are not stressed.    In the high-quality traditional confectionery sector, innovation and the origin of raw materials are competitive factors. In the case of 'Di Iorio', innovation crosses local (i.e., nougat) and national (panettone, Easter eggs, dove bread, etc.) gastronomic culture. However, the origin of the raw materials is not always local. Although this is not in contradiction with the local tradition (since the Romans time, the SES is connected by trades with distant areas), it may pose a problem in communication strategies. For example, in the case of nougat, traditionally, almonds come from the Apulia region while honey is local. At the same time, in the business communication lacks a link with the local social context and environment settings. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative is about a company called Di Iorio in Italy, specifically involving UNIMOL and UNIPI as reference members. It mentions that they're part of a Value Chain (VC) that connects several SESs, which I assume stands for something like Small and Medium Enterprises or similar entities.

The key points from the narrative are:
- The VC connects several SESs to supply raw materials.
- These raw materials include honey and almonds, used in traditional desserts like nougat, panettone, Easter eggs, etc.
- There's a mention of innovation in combining local and non-local products. For example, almonds for nougat traditionally come from Apulia, while honey is local.
- The narrative discusses challenges in communication strategies regarding the origin of raw materials but doesn't stress strong connections to local agricultural production beyond historical context.

Now, I need to determine if cheese with PDO certification is involved here. PDO certification is specific to products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Gorgonzola in Italy.

Looking at the narrative, the focus is on confectionery products like nougat, panettone, Easter eggs, etc., which are baked goods and sweets. The raw materials mentioned are honey and almonds, not cheese. There's no mention of dairy products, milk, or any cheese-related items in the supply chain.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't reference any specific cheese names that I recognize as having PDO status. It talks about traditional desserts but doesn't tie them to cheese-based products. The emphasis is on confectionery and the use of certain nuts and honey, not dairy.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that cheese with PDO certification is part of this value chain. The narrative focuses on sweet goods rather than dairy products, which are typically where PDO cheeses come into play.

Sheep and cows pasture in mountain areas maintain specific land use and landscape scenery. Sheep pasture in Slovak mountains is traditional and thus has also a cultural value.    1) The pasture presence in mountains has been declining mainly due to socio-demographic and economic changes. The pasture decline also impacts land-use changes towards pasture lands' afforestation and, consequently, causes ecological changes in vegetation composition. 2) In recent years, globalization has affected even the traditional cheese production in Slovakia. Several producers started to import, especially during the winter, the sheep's milk from other European countries located more in the South of Europe.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3027 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Slovakia, and the key activities include sheep breeding, cow milk production, cheese production, and marketing. The cheeses involved are Slovenská bryndza, Slovenská parenica (smoked or not smoked), and Slovenský oštiepok (also smoked or not smoked). 

It specifically states that each type of described cheese is registered as a protected product of the EU at the national level in Slovakia with the label 'Protected Geographical Indication' (PGI). PGI is one of the categories under the EU's protected designation of origin system, which includes PDO. So, while it's labeled as PGI here, that falls under the broader category of PDO.

The narrative also mentions that these cheeses are produced in the same way throughout the defined area and use specific breeds of sheep grazed in mountain areas with particular flora and climatic conditions. This contributes to the quality of the raw material, which is sheep's milk, requiring at least 50% from grazed sheep.

Given all this, it's clear that the cheeses involved have a protected designation, specifically PGI, which is part of the PDO system. Therefore, the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France CCVD, and the reference card ID is VC 02 FR1. It talks about extensive sheep farming in the Drôme valley mountain and mid-mountain areas. They have local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to consumers or with the label 'Agneau de Sisteron'. 

I know that PDO certification is a mark of quality for products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods. For example, cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort have PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, it mentions 'local valorization' and direct sales with the label 'Agneau de Sisteron'. I'm not sure if Agneau de Sisteron is a cheese or a meat product. From what I recall, Sisteron is known for its lamb, so maybe it's about meat rather than cheese.

The value chain involves sheep farming, local slaughtering, and direct sales. There's no mention of cheese production at all. The focus seems to be on meat products, specifically lamb, given the label mentioned. Since there's no indication that any cheese is involved in this value chain, I can conclude that it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object because the narrative doesn't mention cheese with PDO.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3015 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the cheese is made from April to October using local goat's milk. It talks about three families involved and their traditional dairy production. They have an annual cheese market and are part of Norsk Gardsost, a Norwegian association of traditional dairies. Additionally, they're endorsed by a Slowfood Presidium, which involves various local actors.

Now, PDO certification is typically given to products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention PDO certification but does highlight their association with Slowfood and traditional methods. However, being part of a Slowfood Presidium can sometimes be indicative of a product seeking or having such certifications, though it's not the same as PDO.

The example given in the narrative is another cheese from Sweden that's supported by a Slowfood Presidium but doesn't mention PDO either. So while there are signs of traditional and local production, without an explicit mention of PDO certification, I can't confirm it. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 55.10%.   Pester plateau is a Special nature reserve area. Family farming is prevailing, sheep are grazed at natural pastures. Sjenica lamb meat, dry meat products and sheep Sjenica cheese have reputation of high quality. Sjenica sheep cheese is also PDO. The area is well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products. Sheep meat has very strong reputation in the country, as well as abroad (region and traditional markets / Muslim countries). There are potentials to protect PDO product at the EU level and have direct export with the label. Adding value to the products by certifying organic production, and/or other certificates that are in line with nature protection are of a great potential. Additionally, connecting the products with sustainable tourism (rural tourism) and other channels for selling these products (e-commerce) creates potential for avoiding low prices and selling animals. Reopening of export to countries asking for halal meat (Middle East, Turkey, etc.) is slowly increasing. Rising interest of young people to be involved in the livestock production creates possibilities for new approaches to traditional farming and product marketing. Sjenica and Tutin areas have higher percentage of young people than other mountainous regions.   Key local assets are multi-cultural area, with strong connections to the neighbouring countries Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Traditional knowledge on livestock farming and production of traditional products (cheese, dry meat) is kept in large multi-generational families. Strong connection to the cultural and national heritage. High level of entrepreneurial spirit reputation of healthy area, food and hospitality.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the main agricultural activity in the Pester plateau is livestock husbandry, specifically sheep farming. It talks about Sjenica lamb meat production being the basis of the value chain. There's also mention of dry meat products and sheep cheese from Sjenica. Importantly, it states that "Sjenica sheep cheese is also PDO." That seems pretty clear.

I should check if there are any other clues or mentions related to PDO certification elsewhere in the text. The narrative discusses potential for protecting PDO products at the EU level and exporting with the label. It also touches on adding value through organic certifications, but that's separate from PDO.

Since the cheese is explicitly mentioned as having PDO certification, I can confidently say that the mountain value chain does involve such cheese.

The cooperative provides an income basis for the mountain farmers which is also of importance regarding the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape, which has value for to
ve having a better income and improved marketing options. On the other side the landscape and the small size of mountain farms is an important asset for BioAlpin to promote regional, organic products in Tyrol. The cooperation among farmers as well as the cooperation with M-Preis at eye-level allows knowledge transfer and innovation. Traditional knowledge as well as innovation plays a crucial role for BioAlpin.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce the cooperative gives them a structure for a better marketing and income. Climate change is a challenge for vegetable/fruit farmers in regard the increasing heat (and heat waves) and thus for irrigation. For pasture farms climate change regards mostly biodiversity and is a logistically challenge because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Bio vom Berg exists since 2002 as a brand of the BioAlpin cooperative. This cooperative allows democratic decision making, coordination of the production and the development of new products in order to secure the income of the farmers. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is of special interest because of it s actors structure and governance of these structure. However, it doesn t meet the criteria in regard to the mountain landscapes system. That s why data in section 3 are provided at NUTS-2 level, since this VC also extends the boundaries of a NUTS-3 region. Interactions (positive and negative impact) with the SES are thus provided as general information.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2724 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the content step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria and the cooperative is called BioAlpin. They focus on promoting regional, organic products in Tyrol. The challenges include climate change affecting vegetable/fruit farmers and pasture farms, but there's no specific mention of cheese or dairy products here.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with innovations in new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. Land use systems include cropland, grassland, forestry, natural land, and pasture farming. Local assets are natural, social, and cultural.

However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese or any dairy-related products. It talks about Bio vom Berg as a brand since 2002, but again, no specifics on cheese types or PDO certification. PDO certification typically applies to specific regional foods with traditional methods, like certain cheeses, wines, or cured meats.

Since there's no direct reference to cheese or any indication that the products are certified under PDO in this narrative, I can conclude that it doesn't involve cheese with such certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the value chain includes farmers who produce and process cheese directly on their farms. It also talks about dairy production based on pastures, which are a natural asset typical in the Swiss cultural landscape. The cheese is produced in an artisanal way, relying on traditional knowledge.

Now, PDO certification typically applies to products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. Switzerland is known for several PDO cheeses, like Gruyère or Emmental. Since the narrative mentions that cheese is made using traditional knowledge and directly on the farm, it suggests a method consistent with PDO requirements.

However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that the cheese has PDO certification. It only describes the production methods and the reliance on local natural assets. Without an explicit mention of PDO, I can't definitively say that the cheese in this value chain has such certification.

Therefore, since there's no clear indication of PDO certification, the correct response would be an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative ID is 2976. It talks about Dinorwig power station, also known as Electric Mountain, which is a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme in Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd LAU1. The content mentions various economic sectors' contributions to the region's GVA, tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and employment sector shares.

It also discusses renewable energy potential from pumped storage projects in Scotland and Wales, highlighting Dinorwig as the largest in the UK and Europe. There are sections about local assets—natural (water, scenery) and social (community relationships, local sponsorships like a museum, hiking trail, marathon). Challenges include protecting a rare fish species.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on hydroelectric power, renewable energy, tourism related to the power station, and environmental considerations. There's no indication that cheese production is part of this value chain, let alone whether it has PDO certification.

PDO certification typically applies to agricultural products like cheeses, wines, etc., where specific regional methods and origins are protected. Since the narrative doesn't touch on food production or cheese at all, I can confidently say that cheese with PDO certification isn't involved here.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2785 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, looking at the narrative, it's about a Value Chain (VC) in the Drôme region, specifically focusing on organic still wine production. The reference member state is France CCVD, and the VC ID is VC 10 FR1. It mentions that this VC was developed as an innovative response to the crisis faced by Clairette de Die, which is a famous local sparkling wine.

The narrative talks about converting old vineyards into new organic still wines using local grape varieties. They've introduced new vinification processes based on organic and agroecological models, along with new marketing strategies like direct sales and local markets. There's also mention of a new viticultor group called Cairn, which operates outside the traditional Clairette de Die unions.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on wine production—specifically organic still wines—and their efforts to innovate and adapt to market changes. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain, let alone whether it has PDO certification.

PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) where the specific origin and traditional methods are crucial to their quality and characteristics. Since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all, I can confidently say that this mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, according to the instructions, if the value chain doesn't involve such cheese, I should return an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3138 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain composed of around 60 sheep farmers, an association, and consumers. The association collects wool and processes it to add value. They mention that the product is Swiss wool, which was previously seen as waste but now valorized into something valuable. There's also a Regional Wool Centre opened for documentation, exhibitions, sales, teaching, and meetings.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on wool—how it's collected, processed, and the new product created from it. They talk about organic farming and high-quality processing but again, that's related to wool, not cheese.

Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification typically applies to food products like cheeses, wines, or cured meats where specific regional factors contribute to their unique characteristics. Since the narrative doesn't mention any dairy products or cheese at all, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in question does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the Value Chain (VC) includes all producers, slaughterhouses, and retailers. It specifically notes that farmers must comply with strict specifications from the Swiss Mother Cow Association and Swiss organic production standards. This suggests a high level of quality control, which is often associated with PDO certification.

The mountain chain in question is the Jura region, known for its cheese production, particularly Comté and Emmental. These cheeses are well-known and have PDO status because they meet specific regional and traditional criteria. The narrative also describes the landscape as limestone rocks with shallow valleys and high plateaus, which supports dairy farming. It mentions milk and cheese production as the primary agricultural resources, further indicating a strong focus on dairy products.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention PDO certification, the emphasis on strict organic standards and the specific reference to cheese production in a well-known region like Jura makes me think that the cheeses involved likely have PDO status. PDO is often tied to regions with unique natural and cultural factors, which aligns with the description provided.

Therefore, I conclude that the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2738 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, and the value chain (VC) has a specific ID: VC 03 BG. It talks about a network of collectors in mountain ranges near Sofia, collecting wild berries with permits from National Parks. The land use systems involved are Forestry, and local assets include Natural.

Next, it states that Bulgaria has adopted conditions for using the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and has approved a national logo. However, the uptake of this OQT is very low.

Now, I need to check if cheese with PDO certification is involved here. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where specific geographical origins and traditional methods are protected. The narrative doesn't mention anything about cheese or dairy products. Instead, it's focused on wild berries collected in mountainous regions under permits, with a national logo for 'Mountain Product' but low uptake.

Since there's no reference to cheese or any dairy-related products, I can conclude that the value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2851 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 03 IT. It talks about having over 1000 families of bees and hive products from BIO agriculture, which I assume means organic. They're described as a specialized pole providing complex services related to rural and cultural aspects.

Now, the key points here are about beekeeping and hive products, specifically mentioning BIO agriculture. Hive products typically include honey, wax, propolis, etc., but not cheese. Cheese production usually involves milk from cows, goats, sheep, etc., which isn't mentioned here. There's no indication of cheese being part of this value chain.

Additionally, PDO certification is specific to certain agricultural products that have a particular quality and uniqueness due to their geographical origin. For cheese, examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Mozzarella di Bufala. However, the narrative doesn't mention any cheese at all; it's focused on bees and hive products.

So, putting this together, since the value chain is centered around beekeeping and organic hive products without any reference to cheese, there's no involvement of cheese with PDO certification here.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative has an ID of 2842. It mentions that the reference member state is Hungary and the Card ID is VC 17 HU. The focus here is on homemade pasta made from just flour and eggs, with no additives or artificial substances. They produce these raw materials themselves to save money and sell the pasta in local grocery stores. The packaging is nice, and it's preservative-free and healthy. The innovation relates to new governance systems, land use involving cropland and hen houses, and local assets like natural and social aspects.

Now, I need to check if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specific to products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Common examples include certain types of cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort.

Looking at the narrative, it's all about pasta. There's no mention of cheese anywhere. The ingredients are flour and eggs, nothing related to dairy or cheese-making processes. The products are pasta, not cheese. Even though they talk about local assets and governance systems, these aspects don't tie into cheese production or PDO certification.

I should also consider if there's any indirect reference that I might be missing. For instance, maybe the mention of a hen house could imply dairy cows for milk, but the narrative specifically talks about pasta production from flour and eggs. There's no indication they're making cheese from milk. So, it seems pretty clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no involvement with cheese or PDO certification in the given narrative, I should output an empty JSON as specified.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2888 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the MOVING reference member state is Italy VINIDEA and the reference card ID is VC 23 IT. It talks about organic production of champenois wines by Ferrari company, which is historically based in Trento. They process grapes from their own farms. 

Looking at the data points: province area is 72.70%, per capita income is €18,788, GVA is €18,788.1 million, primary sector share of GVA is 4.34%, secondary is 22.80%, tertiary is 72.70%. There are 3661 bed places in tourist accommodations, regional share is 9.23%. Number of agricultural holdings is 5962. The nearest big settlement is 20 km away, and there are protected areas present.

The sector shares for employment are similar across province and region: primary 4.80%, secondary 25.29%, tertiary 70.20%.

The narrative then lists three points about the VC: it's based on climate change forecasts and finding alternatives; led by a large wine company investing in the local ecosystem; and can be translated to other areas.

Points two and three mention that it shows how private companies react to climate change, transforming marginal mountain areas into valuable ones for the future. It also highlights potential for investments in local development, marketing strategies, diversification, and the role of private companies.

The challenges include economic sustainability costs and is classified as both traditional and innovative with endogenous innovation related to planting vineyards at higher altitudes based on climate change studies.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or anything related to dairy products. The focus is entirely on wine production, specifically champenois wines, by the Ferrari company. There's talk about tourism, local development, and transforming marginal areas through vineyard investments, but no indication of cheese being part of the value chain.

Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification typically applies to products like cheeses, wines, etc., that have specific geographical origins and traditional production methods. Since this is about wine, specifically champenois wines, if there were PDO certification, it would likely be mentioned. However, the narrative doesn't specify any such certification for cheese or any dairy product.

Therefore, based on the given content, the mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

 local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 2961 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania and the VC ID is VC 20 RO. The main product discussed here is 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni', which started selling fresh Rainbow Trout in 2018 and later diversified into various trout products. They mention processing and sale of additional products, but it doesn't specify what those products are beyond trout.

The value chain is for mountain products like trout and its derivatives. The challenges include premium pricing and competition from lower-quality products. They talk about the importance of being registered as a 'Mountain Product' to boost promotion and consumer trust. However, they still rely on direct sales, which can be affected by external factors like COVID-19.

Romania is highlighted for actively developing Optional Quality Terms (OQT) for mountain products. It's noted that Romania doesn't use any derogation, meaning products must strictly originate from designated mountain areas with no distance allowed. There's mention of a National Registry and Mountain Development Offices handling the OQT and logos. The authority ensures compliance with national regulations.

Now, looking for cheese or dairy products specifically: the narrative focuses on trout and its processed forms. There's no mention of cheese at all. PDO certification is related to specific products that have geographical origins and traditional methods, often applied to cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort. Since the narrative doesn't discuss any cheese products, even though it talks about mountain products and OQTs, the absence of cheese in their offerings means there's no PDO certification involved here.

Therefore, the value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

The JSON is empty because the narrative discusses trout and its derivatives but does not mention cheese or any product with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2737 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, and the value chain (VC) is related to mushroom collection, processing, and export under the brand 'Mushrooms Bulgaria'. The company involved collects wild mushrooms like Black Trumpet, Chanterelle, Fairy Ring, Morel, Porcini, Saffron Milk Caps, and St. George. These are all types of fungi found in forest environments.

The challenges mentioned include correctly identifying species, avoiding contamination, maintaining quality standards, and sustainable harvesting. There's also a note about initiatives to address overexploitation. The VC is classified as Traditional with current challenges, but the type of innovation isn't specified.

Looking at the sectors involved, the primary sector (collection) has low shares in employment and GVA, while the tertiary sector dominates, likely due to tourism and services related to the mushrooms. There's mention of Bulgaria adopting optional quality terms like 'Mountain Product' with a national logo, but it doesn't specify if they're using PDO for cheese.

Cheese with PDO certification typically involves specific regional production methods and ingredients, often tied to dairy products. However, this narrative is focused entirely on wild mushrooms, not dairy or cheese. There's no mention of cheese at all in the value chain described. The company deals with fresh, dried, and frozen mushrooms, not any form of cheese.

Therefore, since the value chain doesn't involve cheese but rather wild mushrooms, it doesn't include PDO-certified cheese.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification as it focuses on wild mushroom collection and processing.

The company is certified with various production quality labels (like BRC and IFS certificates) and it is active in the large-scale retail trade and the Ho.re.ca. sector for the local market. The innovation refers to both Sicilian PDO products and special cheeses like low-fat or lactose-free cheeses. In particular, products like the Provola cheese of Nebrodi is used in the marketing strategy to characterized the company as a producer of traditional Sicilian cheeses.   The company has a commercial relevance for the whole Sicilian dairy sector due to its large production. The cultural elements linked to the dairy tradition are incorporated into the industrial process to offer PDO cheeses and other local products.    Zappalà offers a wide selection of cheese to satisfy different types of consumers, both looking for high quality and certified products and those less interested in these aspects. The milk is collected in the entire regional territory and, if necessary, comes from the extra-regional areas. In this sense, several SES are concerned by the VC.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the main actor is Zappalà company. It says they produce both traditional and PDO-certified cheeses as well as standard products. Specifically, it highlights that they make mozzarella cheese but also mention other cheeses like Provola cheese of Nebrodi, which is used in their marketing strategy to characterize them as producers of traditional Sicilian cheeses.

The narrative also talks about the company being certified with various quality labels and mentions that they incorporate cultural elements linked to dairy tradition into their industrial process. This suggests a strong emphasis on traditional methods, which often aligns with PDO certification since such certifications are tied to specific regions and traditional production methods.

Additionally, there's a mention of doubts arising regarding the transparency of milk's origin for traditional cheese production, like Provola cheese of Nebrodi. While this raises some concerns about sourcing, it doesn't negate the fact that they do produce PDO-certified cheeses.

Putting this together, Zappalà clearly produces cheeses with PDO certification, such as the Provola cheese of Nebrodi. Therefore, the mountain value chain does involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions "Pirot white cheese in brine" produced in the Pirot/Old Mountain area. It specifies that this cheese can be made from sheep, cow, or mixed milk, with sheep and mixed cheeses having a higher reputation. The value chain involves marketing strategies like online sales and partnerships with restaurants and rural tourism.

Now, I'm trying to recall what PDO certification entails. From what I know, PDO is a label used in the European Union for products that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. These products must meet strict quality and authenticity criteria.

Looking at the narrative, it talks about traditional methods and local assets like natural, social, and cultural aspects. However, there's no explicit mention of any certifications, including PDO. The cheese is described as having a good reputation but without any reference to official designations or protected status.

I also note that similar value chains exist in other mountain areas in Serbia for white cheese made from various milks. Again, this doesn't necessarily imply PDO certification unless stated.

Since the narrative doesn't mention anything about PDO or any specific certifications, I can't confirm that the cheese involved has such a designation. Therefore, according to the instructions, if there's no mention of PDO cheese, the JSON should be empty.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 28 ES. It talks about companies associated with PGI Botillo del Bierzo, which are meat companies producing botillo, chorizo, salchichón, etc. They follow production rules set by regulations and a quality manual. There's mention of forbidden use of certain names or brands to avoid confusion.

The challenges faced are current, classified as both traditional and innovative. The innovation here is exogenous, meaning it comes from outside the system. Specifically, they've introduced regulation and certification mechanisms for origin and elaboration process, plus online marketing strategies due to their products' prestige in El Bierzo's gastronomy.

Local assets include cultural aspects, and European regions produce pig-related products with varying certifications and connections to local ecosystems.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese. The narrative focuses on meat products like botillo, chorizo, salchichón—these are all types of sausages or cured meats. There's no reference to cheese at all in the content provided. PDO certification is mentioned in the context of regulations and quality control, but it's applied to the meat products, not cheese.

Since cheese isn't part of this value chain, even though there's a mention of certifications for origin and elaboration, it doesn't pertain to cheese. Therefore, the mountain value chain described here does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Wild populations of forest berries - notably: blackberries, blueberries, eldeberries, lingonberries, rose hips and strawberries. Wild berries are thought to be qualitatively superior to equivalent cultivated stock and therefore remain in very high demand.    The main challenges with wild collected foods (herbs, berries or mushrooms), especially when working with large networks of (often untrained) collectors, are: a) correctly identifying the relevant species / type; b) avoiding contamination (e.g. with soil or other species); c) maintaining a consistent standard of quality, and; d) sustainable harvesting to ensure the continued viability of the harvested populations. Unsustainable harvesting and overexploitation of the most accessible sites is a major problem in Bulgaria and there have been several initiatives and communication campaigns to address this.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2738 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, and the value chain (VC) is related to wild berries collected from mountain ranges near Sofia. The company involved is a Bulgarian-UK business established in 2003, focusing on collecting, processing, and exporting frozen wild forest berries under the brand 'Mushrooms Bulgaria'. They deal with types like blackberries, blueberries, eldeberries, lingonberries, rose hips, and strawberries.

The challenges they face include correctly identifying species, avoiding contamination, maintaining quality standards, and sustainable harvesting. There's also a mention of initiatives to address overexploitation. The VC is classified as Traditional, with the type of innovation unspecified. Land use systems involved are Forestry, and local assets include Natural aspects.

Bulgaria has adopted conditions for using the optional quality term 'Mountain Product' but uptake is low. However, there's no mention of cheese or dairy products anywhere in the narrative. The focus is entirely on wild berries, their collection, processing, and export under a specific brand.

Since PDO certification pertains to products with unique characteristics tied to their geographical origin, and given that this VC deals exclusively with wild berries without any reference to cheese, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The fame of Corsican honey is old but its contemporary reputation results from the professionalization of the activity since 1980 and subsequently from a recognition consecrated by obtaining a PDO in 1998. The PDO brings together six honeys, four of which are produced from the spontaneous flora of the maquis. Except in winter, which is the season during which bee colonies rest, there is one honeydew per season. The definition of honey and its controls are based upon its taste and pollen analyzes, reflecting the foraging areas (heather, asphodel, lavender, broom, oaks, anthilli, thyme, etc.). The value of honey is very directly linked to the management of apiaries in a set of varied environments exposed to climate change. The location of the apiaries is strategic for the production of different honeys, especially those located in the mountains. The value is therefore dependent on the melifer and pollen potential of the foraging areas and the ability of beekeepers to choose the right locations.   The weak industrialization of Corsica and the way in which apiaries are managed, which use several layers of vegetation, are the assets. They also show as many dependencies to the local environment as there are types of vegetations/forageing areas, and as many potential vulnerabilities.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2793 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France INRAE and the Value Chain ID is VC 07 FR. It talks about beekeeping activity being guided by a body managing PDO, but also mentions other organizations for beekeepers. The secondary and tertiary sector shares are unspecified, as well as bed places in tourist accommodations.

Further down, it discusses the primary sector share of employment in the region, which is quite low at 0.036, with the tertiary sector being the highest at 0.802. Then, the fame of Corsican honey is highlighted, noting that its contemporary reputation started after professionalization in 1980 and obtaining PDO in 1998. It mentions six types of honey, four from the maquis flora, and talks about production methods and vulnerabilities due to climate change.

Wait a minute, the narrative is all about honey, specifically Corsican honey, and its PDO certification. There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the text. The focus is on beekeeping, apiaries, and the environmental factors affecting honey production. Cheese isn't discussed at all.

So, since the value chain here is related to honey with PDO, not cheese, I shouldn't include an ID. Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2829 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a social employment program in Hungary where local communities, including poor and unemployed people, especially Roma, are involved. They produce pumpkin seeds and process them into different products. There's mention of a small processing plant with high-tech solar drying equipment, branding, design, and a small shop. The products include peeled seedless pumpkins, herbs, and pumpkin seed oil. These products are sold through short food chains, targeting wealthy customers with attractive packaging.

The value chain uses natural resources from the area, like pumpkin plantations for raw materials. They emphasize solar energy for production and use social networks and ICT for marketing. The challenges include climate change effects like droughts and working with disadvantaged groups.

Nowhere in this narrative is cheese mentioned. The products are all related to pumpkins and herbs, not dairy products. PDO certification typically applies to cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort, which have specific geographical origins and traditional methods. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, it's clear that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as required.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Italy's VINIDEA, and the key activities are vine growing and wine production. It talks about the vineyard area, population stats, economic data like GVA, income levels, and employment sectors. There's also information about tourist accommodations and agricultural holdings.

Then it specifically mentions a wine called 'Vallée d'Aoste Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle DOC', which is made from Prié Blanc grapes. It highlights this wine as an example of quality mountain viticulture contributing to the region's identity and attracting tourists.

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention cheese, let alone any type of cheese with PDO certification. The focus is entirely on wine production, specifically a DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) wine, which is similar but not the same as PDO for cheeses. PDO typically applies to products like certain types of cheese, cured meats, etc., where specific geographical and traditional factors are crucial.

Since there's no mention of cheese at all in the narrative, I can confidently say that this mountain value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3074 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the value chain is based in Spain, specifically UCO as the reference member state. It's a holistic approach combining nature and culture for responsible tourism. The primary sectors have a significant share of GVA, but there's no specific mention of cheese or dairy products.

Looking further, it talks about local gastronomy being part of the offerings. They also mention new products like Iberian ham routes and bird-watching tours. These are based on collaboration between various actors such as conservationists, restaurants, accommodations, and museums. However, there's no direct reference to cheese or any specific product that would require PDO certification.

PDO certification is typically for agricultural products and foodstuffs that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Examples include certain types of cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort. Since the narrative doesn't mention any specific cheese or dairy-related products, I can't assume they're involved in PDO-certified cheese.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned are about making the tourism model appealing, raising awareness on sustainable tourism, and addressing seasonality in employment. These points don't relate to food production or certifications like PDO.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no indication that the mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2868 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. It talks about key activities, actors, labeling, quality schemes, and how the value chain depends on local SES (Socio-Economic Systems). The shares of different sectors in employment are provided for a province and region, but I don't see any direct mention of cheese or dairy products here.

Next, it says that the farm took advantage of EU regulations 1151/2012 and 665/2014 to use the label 'Mountain Product.' These regulations are related to PDO and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) certifications. So, they're using a mountain product label which could be relevant for PDO cheese.

However, when looking at the specific activities, it mentions organic production of cereals and a bakery that follows bio-architecture principles. They use photovoltaics and heat pumps for energy. The focus seems to be on bread production, starting from cereal production up to baking. There's talk about mixing innovative processes with traditional products, visiting bakeries in France and Germany to improve their methods.

The narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese at all. It's more about cereals and bread. Even though they're using mountain product labeling which could apply to cheeses, the specific activities described don't involve cheese production or PDO certification for cheese. They're focusing on grains and baked goods.

So, while the use of 'Mountain Product' label might hint at some form of protected designation, the actual products discussed are cereals and bread, not cheese. Therefore, I can conclude that this value chain doesn't specifically involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the VC's moving reference member state is Spain UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 14 ES. That might be relevant because PDOs are often region-specific, so Spain could have several cheeses with such certifications.

Next, it talks about goats sleeping and grazing in the same farm where cheese production happens. The milk is sent to a lab for processing. High-quality goat cheese from the Florida Andaluza breed is produced here. These goats have grazed in natural pastures for centuries, which suggests a traditional method, possibly indicating a PDO since such products often rely on specific regional practices.

The narrative also mentions challenges like the scarcity of herds and competition with industrially-produced cheese. It's classified as both traditional and innovative, with exogenous innovation related to energy use and waste management. They use solar energy and treat wastewater for reuse in their garden. This doesn't directly mention PDO but shows attention to quality and sustainability.

Another point is that there are other goat cheese producers in the Sierra Morena region, specifically mentioning 'Besos y Quesos' using a different breed. However, this doesn't provide information about PDO status.

I'm trying to recall if Spanish cheeses like Manchego or something similar have PDOs. Florida Andaluza goats might produce a specific type of cheese that could be PDO-certified, especially since it's tied to a region with natural pastures and traditional methods. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that the cheese has PDO certification.

Since there's no direct mention of PDO in the text, I can't confirm it. Therefore, according to the instructions, if it's not mentioned, I should return an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2965 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference card ID is VC 04 UK. It talks about deer hunting, or stalking, being popular tourist activities in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The land where this activity takes place is described as wild. Additionally, it notes that another value chain is undertaken in the same region as well as in North East and North West England (specifically NUTS3 regions).

Now, I'm looking for any mention related to cheese or dairy products with PDO certification. PDO certification is a mark of quality and authenticity, typically associated with specific regional foods like certain cheeses. However, the narrative doesn't mention anything about cheese, milk production, dairy farms, or any food products at all. It's focused entirely on deer hunting as a tourist activity.

Deer hunting or stalking is more related to wildlife management and tourism rather than agriculture or dairy. There's no indication of any agricultural activities, cheese production, or any PDO-related products in the text. The mention of Scotland's Highlands and Islands might make one think of famous Scottish cheeses like Highland Cheese or something similar, but without explicit information, I can't assume that.

Since there's no reference to cheese or dairy in the narrative, it doesn't involve a product with PDO certification. Therefore, according to the instructions, if the value chain doesn't involve such cheese, I should return an empty JSON object.

In the Piacenza province has an average yearly production of 24 million bottles of wine, with an average selling price slightly above 4 €/bottle. The foothill production of Colli Piacentini PDO is able to obtain higher prices, but often barely enough to compensate the greater production costs and the lower yield that are chracteristic of high slope viticulture. There is a strong need in creating added value on wine of the region. The most dynamic situation can be found in Val Nure and Val Trebbia, where all the production is coming from family owned estates, most under organic certified production and used to joint promotional activities. Many wineries in these valleys have already reached high technical quality and outstanding reputation on the national and international markets.

The region has a long history of winemaking with fossilized vine roots and grape seeds excavated from the region showing viticulture taking place as early as 2000 BC. In Roman times, Julius Caesar's father-in-law Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, grew grapes in the Piacenza hills. The Colli Piacentini was once considered part of the Piedmont wine region. To the northwest is the Lombardy wine region of Oltrepò Pavese and, like Oltrepò Pavese, the wine industry of the Colli Piacentini has had strong historical ties to the wine markets of Milan. The region produces over 17 different wines ranging from Vin Santo dessert wines to slightly sparkling frizzante wines. While the practice of labeling wines by varietal is more often associated with New World wines, winemakers in the Colli Piacentini are

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy, specifically UNIMOL and UNIPI. The Value Chain (VC) ID is 24 IT. It talks about wine production in Piacenza province, with an average of 24 million bottles yearly and a selling price just above €4 per bottle. There's a mention of the foothill production of Colli Piacentini PDO achieving higher prices but still struggling due to high costs and lower yields from mountain viticulture.

Wait, so it's about wine, not cheese. The narrative goes into detail about the wine region, its history, DOC designations, and specific wines like Gutturnio, Monterosso Val D'Arda, Trebbianino Val Trebbia, and Val Nure del Colli Piacentini. It also discusses viticulture practices and historical ties to Milan's wine markets.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese with PDO certification. The entire narrative is focused on wine production, vineyards, winemaking techniques, and the economic aspects of the wine industry in the region. There's no reference to cheese at all. Terms like "PDO" here refer to wines, specifically Denominazione di Origine Controllata, which is an Italian certification for wines.

Since there's no mention of cheese or any dairy products, let alone PDO-certified ones, I can conclude that this mountain value chain doesn't involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin certification. Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2893 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy's VINIDEA and the reference card ID is VC 34 IT. It talks about individual winegrowers and small cooperatives producing high-quality red wines, specifically Valtellina Superiore DOCG.

Looking at the key elements here: the focus is on wine production, not cheese. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese-making processes, or any indication that cheese is part of this value chain. The PDO certification mentioned in the query refers to specific cheeses, like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Gorgonzola, which have geographical protections.

Since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all and is centered around wine, it's clear that cheese with PDO certification isn't involved here. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2792 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the Value Chain ID is VC 06 FR. It talks about a not very active union gathering firms, facing a demanding market without production or trade rules. The activity is influenced by summer and export markets. 

Next, it discusses innovation types as both endogenous and exogenous. Specifically, there's mention of new ways to raise animals, like 'suino pesante type' pigs for dry sausages, and efforts to share value from mountain productions with other regional players. The innovations relate to new products, marketing strategies, and governance systems.

The land use systems involve mountain product reputation, and local assets are cultural. They also reference farming methods inspired by 'Suino pesante' and 'Cerdo de la dehessa estremadura' types, which focus on specific feed types like bellota and pienso.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products with PDO certification. The narrative doesn't explicitly talk about cheese at all. It focuses more on animal husbandry methods, particularly pigs, and the production of dry sausages. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain, let alone whether it has PDO status.

PDO certification typically applies to specific regional foods with traditional methods, like certain cheeses. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese or any dairy products, I can infer that cheese isn't involved here. The focus seems to be on meat production and sausage-making rather than dairy.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content without external knowledge, there's no evidence that this mountain value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2832 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain run by a monastery in Hungary. It mentions that they produce high-value local products, including chocolate and biscuits made using traditional herbs like lavender and thyme. They also have various sections such as herb gardens, winery, brewery, fruit and vegetable gardens, among others. The focus is on blending tradition with modern marketing techniques, leveraging their 1000-year history and UNESCO World Heritage status.

Nowhere in the narrative does it specifically mention cheese. The products listed are chocolate, biscuits, herbs from the garden, wine, beer, fruits, vegetables, etc., but cheese isn't mentioned. PDO certification typically applies to specific food products with a geographical origin, like certain cheeses. Since there's no reference to cheese production or any certifications related to it, I can conclude that this value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2717 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria and the reference card ID is VC 12 AT. It talks about 'Lungauer Saatzucht- und Saatbauverein' marketing two-thirds of their edibles through food retailers and Salzburg Lagerhaus, which is a cooperative under RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG. They also mention "serbodner Erdäpfel," which I think refers to starch potatoes, as seen in another VC AT11.

Now, the key points here are that they're marketing edibles through retailers and a cooperative. The specific products mentioned are "edibles" and "Erdäpfel," which translates to potatoes. There's no mention of cheese at all in this narrative. PDO certification is specifically for cheeses or other foods with a traditional regional connection, but since the narrative doesn't talk about cheese, I can't assume it's involved.

I should also consider if there's any indirect reference to cheese through the cooperative or marketing channels mentioned. However, Salzburg Lagerhaus is more likely associated with storage and distribution rather than cheese production. Without explicit mention of cheese or PDO terms like "Schweizer Käse" or specific cheese names, it's safe to conclude that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in narrative 2717 doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 03 SCA. It talks about approximately 6500 Sami people engaged in reindeer herding, specifically noting that only Sami with ancestors linked to reindeer herding have the right. 

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products, especially those with PDO certification. PDO is a specific status given to foods that have a particular quality and are produced in a specific region using traditional methods.

In this narrative, the focus seems to be on reindeer herding by the Sami people in Scandinavia. There's no direct reference to cheese production or any mention of dairy products. The context revolves around herding practices, land rights, and possibly the economic activities related to reindeer but not to cheese-making.

Since there's no information about cheese being part of this value chain, let alone having PDO certification, I can conclude that the mountain value chain in narrative 3009 does not involve cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative ID is 2979. It mentions Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and VC 20 UK as the reference card ID. The region discussed is South Lakeland, which includes parts of the Lake District National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There's a lot of data about population changes, income levels, GVA (Gross Value Added) across different sectors, bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, nearest large settlements, employment sector shares, and some information about outdoor adventure companies.

Looking through all this, I'm trying to spot any mention related to cheese or dairy products. The primary sectors include agriculture, which might involve farming, but the narrative doesn't specify anything about cheese production. There's talk about outdoor activities, tourism, corporate team-building, and educational programs, but nothing that ties into cheese manufacturing or PDO certification.

PDO certification is specific to certain agricultural products that have a particular quality due to their geographical location and traditional methods. For example, cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort have PDO status. However, in this narrative, there's no indication of any cheese production, let alone one with such certification. The focus seems more on tourism and outdoor activities rather than food or agricultural products.

I also check if the terms "cheese," "dairy," "PDO," or similar keywords appear anywhere. Scanning through the text, I don't see any references to cheese or PDO. The economic data points are all about sectors like primary (agriculture), secondary (manufacturing), and tertiary (services). Even though agriculture is mentioned, it's not detailed enough to suggest cheese production.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain in question involves cheese with PDO certification. The narrative doesn't mention any specific products like cheese or any certifications related to them.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has given a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with PDO certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain VINIDEA, and the VC reference card ID is VC 12 ES. It falls under the protection of PDO Ribeira Sacra, which protects wines produced in that area using traditional methods. 

Wait a minute, the narrative says "PDO Ribeira Sacra" but then it mentions cheese as part of the value chain. The text states: "The cheese type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified." So, there's a mention of cheese, but it doesn't specify whether it has PDO certification.

I need to determine if the cheese in question has PDO certification. The narrative explicitly mentions that Ribeira Sacra protects wines, not cheese. There's no direct statement linking the cheese to a PDO certification. Even though the value chain is present in mountain areas of Spain and similar ones exist elsewhere, without explicit mention of cheese having PDO status, I can't assume it.

So, based on the information given, the narrative doesn't specify that the cheese has PDO certification. Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain with ID 3013. My task is to determine if this value chain involves cheese that has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON object containing the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions several points:

1. **MOVING Reference Member State**: It's SKANDINAVIAN UCO.
2. **Reference MOVING Card ID**: VC 07 SCA.
3. **Cereal Mentioned**: Barley is highlighted because it grows quickly and suits mountain areas like Roros, which has extreme climate conditions.
4. **Type of Innovation**: Exogenous. It's associated with the Rorosmat brand, which promotes and sells regional products.
5. **Marketing Strategies**: They use e-commerce on their own website and another platform.
6. **Land Use Systems**: Cropland is involved.
7. **Local Assets**: Natural, social, and cultural aspects are considered.

Now, I need to focus on whether cheese with PDO certification is part of this value chain. PDO certification is specific to certain products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods. Common examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort cheese.

Looking at the narrative, the main product mentioned is barley, which is a cereal. There's no mention of dairy products, milk, or cheese anywhere in the text. The brand Rorosmat promotes regional products, but without specific details about what those products are beyond barley and possibly other crops since cropland is involved.

Since the narrative doesn't reference any cheese or dairy-related products, it seems unlikely that PDO-certified cheese is part of this value chain. The focus appears to be on agricultural production, specifically barley, and marketing strategies for regional goods without specifying any particular protected designation.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, there's no indication that cheese with PDO certification is involved. My conclusion is that the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is Spain UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 22 ES. The goats are used for both cooking traditional dishes and as a tourist attraction. It talks about economic aspects like GVA shares but doesn't specify if any products, particularly cheese, have PDO certification.

The narrative details that the herd is owned by the municipality of El Boalo, grazing in natural pastures which provides ecological benefits like fire prevention. They mention adding value through a School of Shepherds and touristic packages as innovations. However, there's no explicit mention of cheese production or any certifications related to it.

Challenges include abandonment of traditional practices, economic profitability, conflicts with other livestock producers, and finding people to care for the herd. The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation in governance but not necessarily in product certification.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, let alone PDO certification, I can conclude that it doesn't involve such cheese.

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. The narrative focuses on goat herding for both culinary and tourism purposes but does not reference cheese production or any certifications.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2937 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Portugal Estrelda, and the VC ID is PT2. The primary product here is wool from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela sheep. It talks about the sheep breed, their characteristics, and how the wool is used for textiles. There's a lot of data on economic sectors, employment shares, and tourism aspects, but I don't see any mention of cheese or dairy products.

The narrative does discuss wool products, including those from other breeds like Churra Mondegueira and Portuguese Merino. However, it doesn't specify that these wool products are cheeses. PDO certification typically applies to food products, especially cheeses, wines, and certain agricultural goods. Since the focus is on wool for textiles, not dairy or cheese, there's no indication of any cheese being part of this value chain.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned relate to reduced numbers of shepherds due to the nature of the job, but again, this pertains more to sheep farming and wool production rather than cheese-making. There's also a mention of traditional practices in wool weaving, which reinforces that the primary product is wool-based textiles, not dairy products.

Given all this, I don't find any evidence in the narrative that suggests the involvement of cheese with PDO certification. The value chain revolves around wool, its production, and its use in textile industries, without any reference to cheese or dairy applications.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification as it focuses on wool production from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela sheep for textiles.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Turkey, and the Value Chain (VC) ID is VC 18 TR. It talks about small family farms involved in feeding and milking sheep and goats. The cheese is ripened in dried goat or sheep skin, which is described as a unique traditional process. 

It also notes that the cheese made from goat and sheep milk is included in other MRLs (I think this stands for Maximum Residue Limits) in member states like Serbia, Spain, Switzerland. However, it specifically mentions "Bergama tulum cheese" as a special kind made by placing into handmade dried goat or sheep skin.

Now, I need to determine if this cheese has PDO certification. PDO is a certification that protects names of food products and ensures they meet specific quality and production standards in their origin region. 

Looking at the narrative, it doesn't explicitly state whether Bergama tulum cheese has PDO certification. It does mention that the process is unique and traditional but doesn't provide any information about certifications like PDO. There's a mention of other cheeses being included in MRLs, which relates to food safety standards rather than origin protection.

Since there's no direct mention or indication of PDO certification for Bergama tulum cheese in the narrative, I can't confirm that it has such a certification based on the given information.

The narrative does not explicitly mention that Bergama tulum cheese has Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Therefore, an empty JSON is appropriate.

The SES of the area depends on a series of activites based on livestock, which interconect with the production of xinochondros, an integral part of the diet of the mountaineers of Crete and a favourite ingredient of the Cretan cuisine. Livestock in the wider area of Anogeia focuses mainly on dairy sheep and goats breeds, although the traditional sheep/goat breading has become economically unprofitable and heavily dependent on the European subcidies. Ksinochondros, a relatively high priced product, can give a prospect to the graziers. It is a traditional product, not well known in the new generation of consumers. The high quality of milk in combination with high quality of local wheat create a unique product which could be called as super food.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Greece and the VC ID is 21 GR. It talks about xinochontros, also known as ksinochondros, which is produced using milk and wheat. The product is traditional, part of Cretan cuisine, and has a high price. They mention it's made from local resources and has nutritional value.

Now, I know that PDO certification is given to products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. So, does xinochondros qualify? The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether it has PDO status. It mentions that the product isn't well-known among younger consumers but is gaining traction in Greek gastronomy.

I should check if there's any mention of certifications or designations like PDO. Scanning through, I don't see any specific references to PDO or similar terms. The focus seems more on traditional methods and local production without explicitly linking it to a protected status.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no indication that xinochondros has PDO certification. So, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3054 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 18 ES. That gives a hint about the region being in Spain, which is known for various PDO cheeses like Manchego or Iberian ham, but I need to see if cheese is part of this specific value chain.

Looking at the content, it talks about horse breeding in the Cabra and Zuheros mountain ranges. The focus seems to be on equines—horses, mules, donkeys—and their historical role as work and transport animals. There's mention of the Purebred Spanish Horse (Pura Raza Española) and how they're bred extensively in a natural environment.

The narrative also discusses agricultural holdings, tourist accommodations, and economic sectors like primary, secondary, and tertiary. However, these are more about the regional economy rather than specific products like cheese. There's talk of diversifying activities by combining beef cattle breeding with a restaurant, but again, no mention of dairy or cheese production.

I'm looking for keywords related to cheese, milk, dairy processing, or any certifications like PDO. The terms "cheese," "dairy," "PDO," or "Protected Designation of Origin" don't appear anywhere in the narrative. Instead, it's centered around horse breeding and its economic impact, including challenges in the market for foals.

The value chain is described as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation focusing on extensive management and natural pastures. But this pertains to horse breeding methods rather than cheese production.

Since there's no mention of cheese or any dairy-related products, it seems clear that this mountain value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. The focus is entirely on equine animals and their role in the local economy.

First, looking at the narrative, it's about a Value Chain (VC) where the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA, and the reference card ID is VC 39 ES. The main focus seems to be on textile craftsmanship in Grazalema. They mention that Mantas de Grazalema uses Merino sheep wool to produce blankets, scarves, and other garments. They combine traditional handcrafted methods with mechanized processes.

The narrative talks about the economic sectors' shares, per capita income, Gross Value Added (GVA), number of bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, nearest large settlement, and employment sector distributions. However, all these details are related to the textile industry and tourism, not agriculture or dairy products.

There's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the narrative. The primary resource is sheep wool, specifically from Merino sheep, which is used for textiles. Even though sheep are involved, it's for their wool, not milk, which would be necessary for cheese production. 

Additionally, the challenges faced by the company relate to the textile industry's difficulties, such as higher costs and economic crises, but there's no indication of any involvement with dairy products or cheese. The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, focusing on textiles and possibly some new product lines like hats and bags, but again, nothing about cheese.

Since PDO certification applies to products like cheese where the specific origin and traditional methods are crucial for quality and recognition, and given that this narrative doesn't mention cheese at all, it's clear that the value chain in question does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

The mountain value chain described in narrative 3068 focuses on textile production using Merino sheep wool. There is no mention of cheese or dairy products, so it does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that Mila is a cooperative focused on mountain farming and producing high-quality dairy products. They specifically talk about SKYR, which is a dairy specialty made from 100% hay milk from South Tyrolean mountains. The description highlights that it's full of proteins and low in fat.

Now, I know that PDO certification is given to products that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods of production. Products like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Gouda often have PDO status. SKYR isn't a commonly known cheese with PDO certification, but the narrative doesn't explicitly mention any certifications.

The narrative does talk about innovation, mentioning that Mila was the first producer of SKYR in Italy and that it's made with selected ingredients from their specific region. However, without an explicit reference to PDO or similar designations like AOP (Appellation d'Origine Protégée), I can't assume they have such certification.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't mention any protected areas or specific geographical indications tied to the cheese production, which are usually key factors for PDO status. It focuses more on the quality and traditional methods but stops short of detailing certifications.

So, putting it all together, while the product is high-quality and region-specific, there's no direct evidence in the narrative that SKYR has a PDO certification. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Italy, specifically UNIMOL and UNIPI. It talks about enhancing the Montese potato through production chain redefinition and promotional activities. There's a lot of data about agricultural holdings, employment sectors, and regions like Emilia Romagna, Campania, and Tuscany.

It mentions that potatoes were traditionally considered a commodity but have seen new marketing strategies to mitigate reduced consumption. The project under the RDP 4 aims to improve the perceived value of mountain products by adopting the European 'Mountain Product' brand along with 'Patata di Montese'. They're working on packaging, distribution, and marketing activities.

Nowhere in this narrative is cheese mentioned. It's all about potatoes—production, marketing strategies, brands like 'Patata di Montese', and the use of the 'Mountain Product' label. There's no reference to dairy products or any mention of cheese at all. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) where origin and specific production methods are protected.

Since the entire narrative focuses on potatoes and their value chain, without any indication that cheese is involved, I can conclude that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this mountain value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided narrative.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the key actors are farmers who manage their activities independently without a specific organization. The mountain chain in question is the Jura region, which is known for its cheese production, particularly Comté and Emmental. However, I don't see any explicit mention of these cheeses or any PDO certification in the text.

The narrative does talk about milk and cheese being the primary agricultural resources, but it doesn't specify the types of cheese or whether they have PDO status. It also mentions clock-making as a cultural heritage but doesn't relate that to cheese production or certification.

Since there's no direct reference to cheese with PDO certification in the provided content, I can't confirm that the value chain involves such cheeses. Therefore, according to the instructions, if it doesn't involve PDO cheese, I should return an empty JSON.

Further, the 'natural landscapes' are a key asset in the marketing of Styria beef. The feeding is used as argument for the special taste of the beef.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce Styria Beef provides in this regard a niche by producing and selling a premium product. Climate change is a challenge for pasture farms mostly in regard to biodiversity and logistically because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Some alpine pastures are used as ski slopes which is an overall challenge that might change in the course of climate change. An increasing artificial snow infrastructure is a challenge in regard to the 'beauty of the landscape. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The invention of 'Styria Beef' was a reaction due to the lack of quality beef products in the late 1980s in Austria. Styria beef has not only been representing itself as a new brand, but has set new standards in regard to animal welfare (suckler cow husbandry) that are now common in mountain farming practices in Austria. The innovation is related to New product and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural and social.   There are some farmers from the neighbouring federal states of Carinthia and Lower Austria supplying Styria beef.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2726 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria and the reference card ID is VC 20 AT. It talks about "Styria beef," which is a premium organic beef product from Styria. The homepage states it's only available on-farm, small food shops, and high-class gastronomies. There's also mention of community among farmers and natural landscapes as key assets in marketing.

The challenges faced include income for mountain farmers, climate change affecting pasture farms, and issues with alpine pastures being used as ski slopes. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. It was created in the late 1980s due to a lack of quality beef products, introducing new standards for animal welfare.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or any dairy product. The focus is entirely on beef production—Styria Beef. There's no reference to cheese being part of the value chain, nor is there any indication that PDO certification applies here since PDO typically relates to specific agricultural products with a defined geographical origin, like certain cheeses.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't involve cheese at all, let alone one with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the Almenland small local dairy produces various types of cheese from cow, sheep, and goat milk, all sourced from the region using pasture farming and hay. They process this cheese further, and it's mentioned that some cheeses are matured in the tunnel of a former silver mine for up to 1.5 years. This maturing process is unique, as noted.

The narrative also talks about participation in international cheese competitions where they've won awards, including being vice world champions. However, there's no specific mention of any certifications like PDO. PDO certification typically requires that the product not only comes from a specific region but also follows traditional methods and has a unique character due to its geographical location.

While the cheese is described as being made from local hay milk and matured in an unusual way, which could contribute to its unique characteristics, there's no explicit mention of it having PDO status. Without that specific certification mentioned, I can't assume it has one based solely on the information provided.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the narrative provided.

The narrative ID is 2980. It talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions the North-West Highland landscape, wildlife tourism, flora and fauna species like red deer, ptarmigan, golden eagles, etc. It discusses the scenic value for visitors, environmental and cultural knowledge by locals, challenges related to wildlife disturbance, climate change impacts, land ownership issues, species reintroduction projects, and the effects of Covid-19 on tourism.

It also mentions that the VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with innovations in new products, marketing strategies, etc. The land use systems are grassland, forestry, and natural land, with local assets being natural and cultural.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of cheese or dairy products. It's focused on wildlife tourism, landscapes, environmental issues, and tourism-related innovations like webcams and online booking. There's no indication that the value chain involves food production, specifically cheese, let alone one with PDO certification.

PDO certification is typically for agricultural products, especially cheeses, wines, etc., that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods. Since the narrative doesn't touch on any such products or certifications related to food, I can confidently say that cheese with PDO certification isn't part of this value chain.
</think>

The narrative does not mention cheese or any food products, focusing instead on wildlife tourism and natural landscapes. Therefore, it does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the MOVING reference member state is SPAIN ADEGUA, and the reference card ID is VC 38 ES. It talks about cultivation over the past 50 years in family farms, with a harvest reaching up to 2.5 million kg. Marketing is done through cooperatives.

Looking at the economic data: capita income is around €16,409 per year, and the Gross Value Added (GVA) for the region is €150,440 million annually. The primary sector contributes about 6.53% to GVA, secondary 20.01%, and tertiary 73.46%. There are 148 bed places in tourist accommodations, which seems low but not directly related to cheese.

The narrative also mentions the number of agricultural holdings (1287) and the nearest large settlement is about 40.6 km away. It notes that there are no protected areas in the region, which might be relevant for PDO status since such designations often require specific geographic regions with unique characteristics.

Moving on, it discusses employment sector shares: primary 9.44%, secondary 16.41%, tertiary 74.15%. The main crop is described as the first stone fruit to reach the market, adapting well to cold climates and high altitudes. They grow up to nine varieties of these fruits, which help stagger production and provide employment in areas like Sierra Sur and Sierra Mágina in Jaén province.

The challenges include low prices that don't cover costs (70% of crop) and spring storms causing significant damage (80% loss in 2020). The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. It mentions some marketing strategies like a Cherry Festival started in 1984, gastronomic proposals, and liqueur production, but nothing about cheese.

Throughout the narrative, there's no mention of cheese at all. It focuses on stone fruits, cultivation, economic data, and marketing initiatives related to agriculture and tourism, specifically festivals and liqueurs made from these fruits. There's no indication that any dairy products are involved, let alone cheese with PDO certification.

PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where the specific methods, ingredients, and origin contribute to their unique characteristics. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese or dairy, it's clear that this value chain isn't about such products. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the activity revolves around the Defense and Management Organization of the PDO. It talks about diseases in orchards and local uses of flour called "pulenta." The value chain is described as endogenous and exogenous, with innovation in controlling the sanitary state of trees and constituting chestnut groves as a common resource.

It also mentions that the land use system involves forestry, specifically chestnut groves with economic and landscape values. Local assets include social and cultural aspects. Countries involved are Greece, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy (producing chestnut flour), and Turkey, which has high-value products under GI (Geographical Indication).

Now, I need to determine if cheese is part of this value chain. The narrative discusses chestnut groves, flour production, and other related activities but doesn't mention anything about cheese or dairy products. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where the specific origin and traditional methods are crucial. Since there's no reference to cheese in the narrative, it seems that the value chain isn't focused on cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, I should output an empty JSON as specified.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3144 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I'll create a JSON object with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain is managed by the 'Association interprofessionnelle de l'absinthe', which deals with absinthe production. It talks about the economic sectors in the region, shares of GVA (Gross Value Added), and employment statistics. There's also a mention of a quality scheme with PDO certification for a product that has strong territorial identity and high reputation.

Wait, the narrative specifically says they successfully registered a quality scheme with a PDO. The product in question here is absinthe, not cheese. Absinthe is an alcoholic drink, typically made from herbs like wormwood, fennel, and aniseed. Cheese, on the other hand, is a dairy product. Since the narrative doesn't mention anything about cheese production or certification related to cheese, I can conclude that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned are about certifying absinthe with AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée), which is similar to PDO in some contexts. There's no reference to cheese at all. Therefore, the mountain value chain described doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

The narrative discusses a value chain centered around absinthe production, not cheese. It successfully registered a quality scheme with a PDO for absinthe but does not mention cheese.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 CZ. Syrup producers are not necessarily located in mountain areas. They collect ingredients from the mountain region and process the ingredients in nearby regions. Crucial point: This VC is classified as Traditional. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural. The VC is not so important in terms of the use of natural (tangible) resources, but it is a typical example of the VC that is embedded in mountain region, but uses the intangible resources of the region.

Okay, so the narrative talks about a value chain (VC) related to syrup production. It mentions that syrup producers collect ingredients from mountain regions and process them nearby. The VC is traditional, classified as such, with unspecified innovation. Land use systems are natural, and local assets include both natural and cultural resources. Importantly, it's noted that the VC isn't heavily reliant on tangible natural resources but uses intangible ones.

Now, I need to check if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specific to certain products that have a particular geographical origin and traditional methods of production. Cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort are examples with PDO status.

Looking at the narrative, it's about syrup producers, not cheese. The key points here are "syrup" and "ingredients from mountain regions." There's no mention of cheese, dairy products, or any specific certification related to cheese. The focus is on the production process and the classification of the VC as traditional.

Since the narrative doesn't reference cheese at all, let alonePDO-certified cheese, I can conclude that this value chain does not involve such cheese. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should return an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2897 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the main production is organic beef, which is produced entirely on pasture, processed locally, and sold at a regional level. It also talks about organic dairy production and sheep breeding being part of the sector but doesn't specify if they produce cheese or other dairy products. 

The narrative highlights several points about the value chain's success, including land reversion through innovation, strong social cooperation, and environmental preservation. However, there's no mention of any specific certifications like PDO for their products. They do talk about avoiding misuse of fame by external actors processing agriculture products from other areas, but that doesn't necessarily relate to PDO certification.

PDO certification is typically associated with specific regions where the product's characteristics are directly linked to its geographical environment. The narrative does mention that the area has protected landscapes and organic animal husbandry, which could be relevant for PDO. However, without explicit information about cheese production or any mention of PDO, I can't confirm it.

So, based on the given content, there's no clear indication that the value chain involves cheese with PDO certification.

The narrative does not explicitly mention cheese production or Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2880 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the Moving reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 48 IT. The farm in question is 'Latte del Parco,' which is linked to the natural and cultural context of the mountains, specifically mentioning mountain pasture as a resource.

Next, it points out that the value chain is less competitive because milk and cheese aren't certified as organic. It also notes that the production's territorial and historical identification is reported in a limited way. This part is crucial because PDO certification often relies on specific geographical origins and traditional methods. If the cheese isn't certified organic, that doesn't necessarily rule out PDO, but it does suggest that maybe they're not emphasizing organic practices.

The narrative goes on to say that 'Latte del Parco' doesn't fully utilize e-commerce potential and lacks links with other breeders. The challenges faced are both current and predicted, classifying the VC as Traditional. Innovation in the VC is unspecified, but it does mention processed products beyond local dairy traditions, like ice creams and parfaits from farm milk, along with tourist services.

Looking for any mention of PDO certification: I don't see any direct reference to cheese having a Protected Designation of Origin. The focus seems more on traditional methods and limited use of e-commerce rather than specific certifications like PDO. Since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that the cheese has PDO status, I can't assume it does.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no indication that the cheese in this value chain has PDO certification.

Road accessibility has improved a lot in recent years, but it is still 'difficult' to get there. The impact of climate change in the Vila Nova de Foz Côa region have been similar to the environmental changes occurred in the rest of the Douro region. High temperatures Summers, heat waves, prolonged and intense droughts have been experienced throughout the region. These changes call into question the survival of some crops, including vines. The adaptation of the production methods and agricultural crops is essential. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Many companies present in the region with solid export volumes. Conversion of vineyards to organic production. Replanting old vineyard with the same traditional grape varieties. Investment by young farmers in the region through the production of wine (and olive oil). Growth of wine tourism, tourism supported by the skills of the municipality (wine, almonds, olive oil and schist) is fundamental for the development of the territory. Vila Nova de Foz Côa, over the years, has been prominent as a tourist destination. Landscapes, heritage, culture, traditions and gastronomy are the basis for the development of rural tourism. The Côa Museum stands out as a portal that allows visitors to discover the rock art of the Côa and Douro valleys.The Museum is also a welcoming center for researchers who wish to study the Côa, taking advantage of the largest national library dedicated to rock art. The region stands out for being the only one to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO - the paleolithic rock engravings located in the Côa river valley and the Alto Douro Wine Region. The innovation is related to New product, new process, new marketing strategy and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Crop land, grassland, forestry and natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2921 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the main activities in Vila Nova de Foz Côa include wine production, olive oil, almonds, and tourism related to archeology, land, and olive trees. It talks about smallholdings with vineyards being predominant, improved road accessibility, and challenges from climate change affecting crops like vines.

Further down, it discusses the types of products: wine, olive oil, almonds, and mentions tourism aspects. There's a focus on organic production, replanting old vineyards, young farmers producing wine, and growth in wine tourism. The region is highlighted for its cultural and natural heritage, including being a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of cheese or dairy products. The emphasis is on wine, olive oil, almonds, and tourism. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano) where the specific origin and production methods are protected. Since there's no reference to cheese here, it seems that the value chain doesn't involve such products.

Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2987 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Serbia, with the card ID VC 06 SER. It talks about local wild berries being picked to supplement incomes. These are described as pure natural products dependent on the natural system. The local knowledge includes aspects of nature, society, and culture.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products in this narrative. The focus here is on wild berries, which are fruits, not cheeses. There's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain at all. PDO certification typically applies to specific agricultural products like certain types of cheese, wines, or cured meats where the origin and traditional methods are crucial.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese or any dairy-related products, it seems clear that cheese isn't involved here. Therefore, there's no need to include an ID in the JSON response because the criteria aren't met.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the given narrative about a mountain value chain involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative is ID 3059 and talks about Siete Valles de Montaña, which is the first cooperative of organic livestock farmers in Cantabria. They mention animal welfare, consumer health, proximity trade, environmental commitment, and social commitment. The main challenge they face is consolidating after four years amidst a health and economic crisis. They focus on short marketing channels, direct sales, or specialized commercial channels that align with their production philosophy.

Looking through the details, I don't see any mention of cheese specifically. The narrative discusses organic livestock farming, grazing practices, and challenges related to market channels and sustainability. It also talks about being a traditional yet innovative value chain, highlighting aspects like certified organic production, cooperative structure, and direct marketing. However, there's no reference to cheese or dairy products at all.

Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification is typically associated with specific regional foods, often cheeses, wines, or other agricultural products. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese or any PDO-related terms, I can infer that this value chain isn't about cheese with PDO certification.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative is about a value chain in Hungary, specifically in the Balaton Uplands area. The key activities include collecting truffles, making special processed products, and organizing truffle collecting tours. A young couple runs this venture as lifestyle entrepreneurs. They collect truffles with their dogs and then create processed products like cheese stuffed with truffle, oil with truffle, and salt with truffle. These are described as innovative because they don't exist in the area before.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese having PDO certification. PDO is a specific type of protected status that denotes that a product comes from a particular region or locality where its quality and characteristics are influenced by that environment. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Champagne.

In the narrative, it says they use local artisanal cheese to make their products. However, there's no explicit mention of whether this cheese has PDO certification. The focus is more on the processed products being innovative and using local ingredients rather than the cheese itself having any special designation.

I should also consider if the context implies PDO without stating it outright. For instance, if they were using a well-known regional cheese that's typically PDO-certified, but again, there's no indication of that here. The narrative doesn't mention any certifications or designations for the cheese used in their products.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned include uncertainty about continuing to use forests for truffle collection and marketing their tours, but nothing about the certification status of their ingredients.

So, based on the information given, there's no evidence that the cheese involved has PDO certification. The narrative focuses on the processed products being innovative and locally sourced, not on any specific certifications for the cheese itself.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Narrative:** The value chain is centered around truffle collection in Hungary's Balaton Uplands, producing processed products like truffle-stuffed cheese and organizing tours.
2. **Identifying Key Elements:** The focus is on innovative processed products using local ingredients, including cheese.
3. **Checking for PDO Certification:** There's no mention of the cheese having any specific certifications like PDO in the narrative.
4. **Conclusion:** Since there's no explicit or implied reference to PDO certification for the cheese used, it doesn't qualify.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2933 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully and analyze it step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the MOVING reference member state is PORTUGAL ESTRELA, specifically referring to Serra da Estrela. The product in question here is Zimbro Brandy. It's described as being made from Wild Zimbro harvested by shepherds, then fermented and distilled in traditional alembics. 

I know that PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where the specific origin and traditional methods are crucial to their quality and characteristics. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort cheese. However, this narrative is talking about a brandy made from Zimbro, which is Juniperus communis. 

Looking through the details, there's no mention of cheese at all. The product is clearly an alcoholic beverage—brandy. Even though it's described as innovative and connected to local natural assets, it doesn't fall under the category of cheese. PDO usually pertains to food products with a strong geographical and traditional link, but in this case, it's about brandy.

Additionally, the narrative discusses the production process, which involves fermentation and distillation, typical for spirits rather than dairy products. There's also mention of the product being sold through e-commerce and its classification as innovative due to using an autochthonous species. 

Since cheese isn't mentioned anywhere in the description, I can conclude that this value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the narrative provided.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the VC ID is 34 ES. It talks about a highly feminized value chain combining public, private, and social resources in a mixed governance system. The economic sectors' shares are given: secondary sector at 17.61%, tertiary at 71.89% for the province, and similar stats for the region.

Looking further, there's data on Gross Value Added (GVA) across different regions, number of bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, nearest large settlement distance, and employment sector shares. It also mentions protected areas in the region.

Then, the narrative shifts to elderly care as an important economic activity due to an aging population. It discusses a private care company hiring local women, professionalization through certificates based on informal experience, maintaining female population under 65, attracting immigrants, especially females, some in formal sectors and more in informal ones.

The value chain involves multilevel governance with various actors but needs better structuring. There are mentions of municipal residences for the elderly managed by a private company (PROMI), active participation centers, dependency assistance companies hired by municipalities, emergency carers managed by the Provincial Council, and assistance frameworks.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus seems to be on elderly care services, combining public and private resources, professionalization of care, and economic activities related to tourism (bed places) and agriculture (agricultural holdings). There's no indication that the value chain involves food production, specifically cheese, let alone PDO certification.

PDO certification is typically associated with specific agricultural products like cheeses, wines, etc., which have a unique origin and traditional methods. Since the narrative doesn't touch on any such products or their certifications, I can confidently say that this mountain value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania, with the VC ID 20 RO. The company involved is 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni', which started selling fresh Rainbow Trout in 2018 and later diversified into processing and selling a variety of additional products. 

First, I should recall what PDO certification entails. PDO is a label used to protect food products that have specific characteristics due to their geographical origin. For cheese, this often involves traditional methods and specific ingredients tied to the region.

Looking at the narrative, it talks about Rainbow Trout being sold fresh and then processed into various products. However, there's no mention of cheese or dairy products at all. The focus is on fish processing and diversification into other products, but nothing related to cheese production or PDO certification.

It talks about Sami people engaged in reindeer herding, with specific numbers for population density and changes over the last decade. There's a lot of data on economic indicators like per capita income, Gross Value Added (GVA) across different sectors, and employment shares.

Then, it discusses tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and the nearest large settlement. The primary sector has low shares in both GVA and employment, which might suggest that while reindeer herding is important, other sectors contribute more to the economy.

The narrative emphasizes high reputation and quality products linked to ancient traditions, noting that reindeer meat and cold-smoked meat have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) granted by the EU. It also mentions new products and practices in herd management, adding value to the chain. The VC is tied to arctic pastures and involves a network of organizations at various levels.

Now, I'm looking for cheese with PDO certification. The narrative specifically talks about reindeer meat and cold-smoked meat getting PDO status, not cheese. There's no mention of dairy products or cheese in the entire text. Reindeer herding is central, but that's for meat production, not cheese.

So, based on this, the value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification. It's about meat products. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2772 involves cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic and the reference card ID is VC 17 CZ. It talks about animals being hunted by members of a hunters' organization, and that the game meat wasn't available for mainstream consumers but has recently opened up to public by developing in several countries: Poland, Germany, Austria.

Hmm, okay. So the value chain here seems to be centered around hunting and game meat. The key points are about the hunters' organization, the availability of game meat, and expanding into other countries. There's no mention of cheese at all in this narrative. PDO certification is specifically for products like cheese that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods.

Since the narrative doesn't talk about dairy products, cheese production, or any food items beyond game meat, it seems clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain. Therefore, there's no indication that any cheese with PDO certification is involved here.
</think>

The narrative does not mention cheese or any product related to dairy, so it doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

ents were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    At such high altitude the pastures are increasingly liable to abandonment (due to their inaccessibility, low productivity and poorly targeted policy support) leading to scrub encroachment (by juniper) and the consequent loss of biodiversity value. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. There are four innovations associated with this value chain: a) Setting up a NEW farm holding in the high mountains at a time when people are leaving the region not settling there plus good dialogue and cooperation with other farmers in the region; b) Introduction of suckler beef cows (Aberdeen Angus) there no tradition of grass-fed beef production in the region; c) Establishment of a rotational grazing system using electric fences, and; d) Direct online sales of beef and processed beef products (notably to customers in Sofia) supported by an effective marketing campaign on social media (Facebook and blog). The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2742 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, and the VC ID is VC07 BG. The farm involved is Linbul Farm, located in Petrohan area of Berkovitsa Municipality, Montana Province. 

The challenges they face include pasture abandonment due to high altitude issues like inaccessibility and low productivity. They've introduced innovations such as setting up a new farm holding, introducing suckler beef cows (Aberdeen Angus), establishing rotational grazing with electric fences, and direct online sales of beef and processed products.

They also mention that Bulgaria has adopted conditions for using the optional quality term 'Mountain Product' with a national logo, but uptake is very low. 

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The innovations are focused on beef production, rotational grazing, and marketing strategies for beef and processed beef products. There's no indication that they're producing cheese, let alone one with PDO certification.

PDO certification typically applies to specific regions and traditional products like cheeses. Since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all, it seems clear that this value chain isn't involved in cheese production with PDO certification.

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification as there is no mention of cheese production.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 03 ES. It talks about Cazalla de la Sierra having around 15 distilleries, but only two remain now. There's a mention of quality certification by a committee that has since disappeared. The focus seems to be on new products and marketing strategies, with land use systems as cropland and local assets including natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to check if this value chain involves cheese with PDO certification. PDO certification is specific to certain agricultural products, like cheeses, wines, etc., that have a traditional link with the area they come from. The narrative here doesn't mention anything about cheese at all. Instead, it's talking about distilleries and their products, which are likely alcoholic beverages rather than dairy products.

Additionally, the narrative mentions that there used to be a committee certifying quality, but it has disappeared. However, this certification isn't specified as being related to PDO or any specific agricultural product like cheese. The focus is more on the decline of distilleries and changes in their strategies.

Since there's no mention of cheese, dairy products, or any indication that the value chain involves PDO-certified goods, I can conclude that it doesn't involve cheese with such certification.

The narrative mentions a Value Chain (VC) where the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the specific card ID is VC 13 SCA. It gives an example of a raspberry farm called Veiseth. The farm allows visitors to pick their own raspberries, buy fresh or frozen ones, and purchase raspberry juice. 

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovations mentioned are allowing customers to pick fruits themselves, which adds a recreational and educational experience, strengthening the producer-consumer bond. Additionally, they offer various products like frozen berries and juices for year-round availability. These innovations relate to new products and marketing strategies.

Looking at the land use systems involved, it's Cropland, and local assets include Natural and social aspects.

Now, I need to determine if cheese with PDO certification is part of this value chain. PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where specific geographical regions are recognized for their unique characteristics. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort.

In the narrative, the focus is on raspberries and related products—fresh, frozen, and juice. There's no mention of cheese at all. The innovations revolve around fruit products, not dairy or cheese-related items. Therefore, it seems that cheese isn't part of this value chain, let alone one with PDO certification.

So, since the narrative doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification, I should return an empty JSON object as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the narrative step by step.

First, the narrative mentions Spain's beef cattle production in 2019, which is part of the primary sector. It talks about the Natural Area of Las Tuerces and provides various statistics like area size, population density, GVA, etc. These details are more about the economic structure and demographics rather than specific products.

Then there's a section about 'Carne de Cervera,' which refers to meat from a specific breed with traditional management practices. It mentions that the animals are kept in the wild for nine months and sheltered during winter. This seems focused on beef or meat production, not dairy or cheese.

The narrative also discusses extensive livestock farming in public utility forests managed by local councils. Again, this points towards meat production rather than cheese-making. There's no mention of milk processing, cheese production, or any specific cheese names that I recognize as PDO products.

PDO certification typically applies to products like cheeses where the origin and traditional methods are crucial. Examples include Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort. Since the narrative doesn't reference any cheese at all but rather meat, it's unlikely that cheese with PDO certification is involved here.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of dairy products. The text talks about agricultural holdings and extensive livestock farming, which could include both meat and dairy animals. However, without specific references to cheese production or PDO terms, I can't assume it's about cheese.

In summary, the narrative focuses on beef cattle and meat production in a specific region with traditional methods but doesn't mention cheese or any certification related to it. Therefore, the mountain value chain described does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Switzerland 2 and the VC ID is VC05 CH2. The value chain includes farmers, breeding horses in the wild, slaughterhouses and processors for sausage, terrine, or fresh meat, and local butcher shops for sale. 

Looking at the economic data, it talks about per capita income, GVA, sector shares, etc., but nothing here directly mentions cheese. It does mention that the primary products are horse meat, processed into sausages, terrines, or sold fresh. They also talk about promoting the local meat as a cheaper alternative to cow meat and addressing taboos around eating horse meat.

The key assets mentioned are local know-how and cultural heritage related to the Franche-Montagne horse breed and wooded pastures. There's no mention of cheese production at all in this narrative. PDO certification is specifically for products like cheese that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods, but since there's no cheese involved here, it doesn't apply.

So, based on the information given, the value chain is about horse meat processing, not cheese. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 3017 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 11 SCA. The product in question is Rakfish, which is fermented trout. It's noted as one of the most extended traditional products in Norway. 

The text describes how the fish are taken from the water and immediately put into buckets for fermentation. There's a lot of data about economic indicators like per capita income, GVA (Gross Value Added), sector shares, bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and proximity to settlements. It also mentions that there are protected areas in the region.

Importantly, it talks about Rakfish having a high reputation and long tradition in Norwegian cuisine. The narrative highlights the use of e-commerce and quality and geographical indication labeling to improve marketing. Geographical indications often tie into PDO or PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) certifications because they denote products specific to a region with unique characteristics.

Further, it mentions that the social asset is represented by the PDO that brings producers together. This explicitly points towards the product having a PDO certification. Additionally, Rakfish is described as a traditional product consumed throughout Norway and uses a unique fermentation method in Europe.

However, I need to confirm if this product is cheese. The narrative clearly states it's fermented trout, which is a fish product, not cheese. Cheese would typically come from milk, but here the focus is on fish processing. Therefore, even though there's mention of PDO for marketing and social assets, the product isn't cheese.

So, putting it all together: while the value chain does involve a product with PDO certification (Rakfish), that product is fermented trout, not cheese. Since the question specifically asks about cheese with PDO certification, this narrative doesn't meet the criteria.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2833 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain run by a monastery in Hungary. It mentions that they produce high-value local products, mixing tradition with modern marketing. They have various agricultural holdings like herb gardens, winery, brewery, and fruit and vegetable gardens. The primary ingredients include lavender from their abbey garden. Packaging is described as innovative and high quality.

Nowhere in the narrative does it specifically mention cheese or any dairy products. The focus seems to be more on herbs, wines, beers, fruits, and vegetables. There's also a mention of selling history and culture, leveraging UNESCO World Heritage status, but again, no direct reference to cheese.

Since PDO certification is specific to certain agricultural products with unique characteristics tied to their origin, the absence of cheese in the description means there's no indication that any cheese here has PDO certification. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2742 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Linbul Farm in Bulgaria's Berkovitsa Municipality. It mentions that they're an innovative farm enterprise grazing Aberdeen Angus suckler herds on rough high-altitude pastures. The value chain here seems to be focused on livestock farming, specifically cattle, and their management practices. 

I'm looking for any mention of cheese production or PDO certification. PDO is a specific type of protected status for food products that have traditional significance in a particular region. For example, Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort are PDO cheeses.

In the narrative, there's no direct reference to cheese being produced. The focus is more on the grazing practices and the economic aspects of the farm, like how they're using natural assets and EU CAP payments. There's talk about combining new products with innovative management and marketing strategies, but without specific mention of cheese or any indication that a PDO-certified product is involved.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't list any products beyond mentioning the suckler herd and their grazing on high-altitude pastures. It discusses economic data like GVA shares across sectors but doesn't tie these to specific agricultural products like cheese.

Since there's no explicit mention of cheese production or PDO certification in the provided text, I can conclude that this value chain does not involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2869 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that the MOVING reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 27 IT. It talks about 'Docendo Discitur' which doesn't depend on other SES, focusing on apple production with specific product innovations like sparkling apple cider. There's mention of combining scientific knowledge with traditional know-how for product and marketing strategies.

The challenges include climate change affecting apple cycles and droughts, impacting the VC negatively. The market is niche, so innovation and marketing are crucial. The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovations. It highlights new products like sparkling cider and new marketing strategies, including being part of an e-commerce platform for fair and sustainable production.

Now, looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products. The narrative focuses on apple production, specifically cider. There's no indication that the value chain involves cheese at all. PDO certification is typically associated with specific cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort, which have strict origin and production requirements. Since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese but rather apples and cider, it's clear that cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no mention of cheese, especially not PDO-certified cheese, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

The connection with the land use system is strong, since the cheese can only be produced by 'Podolica' cows bred through the wild or semi-wild systems. The amount of product available for the market is limited. Thus, besides the local makets and on-farm selling, producers started to exploit alternative marketing strategies to reach larger consumer communities such as e-commerce and on-farm selling connected with hosting activities.

The Caciocavallo cheese is produced in a very remote mountain area with a market trait of rurality which is affected by ageing population and depopulation.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2874 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the cheese is produced using milk from the 'Podolica' cow, a local breed. It also notes that the processing relies on traditional activities. The cheese in question is Caciocavallo, which holds a national label as a 'Traditional Food Italian Product.' This suggests it's recognized at least nationally for its traditional status.

The narrative emphasizes that Caciocavallo is an identity of the area and valorizes local traditions and cultural know-how. It also mentions that the cheese can only be produced by Podolica cows bred in wild or semi-wild systems, indicating a strong connection to the local environment and methods.

Now, I'm trying to recall what PDO certification entails. PDO is a designation given to products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities due to that origin. It's about ensuring that the product not only comes from a particular place but also that its characteristics are directly linked to that region's natural and human factors.

In this case, Caciocavallo is tied closely to the Southern Italian regions, specifically using Podolica cows in remote mountain areas with traditional methods. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention PDO certification, but it does talk about a national label as a Traditional Food Product. I'm not sure if that's equivalent to PDO or just another form of recognition.

I should consider whether the description provided meets the criteria for PDO. Since the cheese is linked to specific local breeds and traditional methods, and it's recognized nationally, it might qualify. However, without an explicit mention of PDO certification, I can't be certain. The narrative doesn't provide any information about EU designations or specific PDO status.

Therefore, based solely on the given content, there's no direct evidence that Caciocavallo has PDO certification. It does have a national label, but that might not equate to PDO.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2874 involves cheese known as Caciocavallo, which holds a national label as a 'Traditional Food Italian Product.' While the cheese is closely tied to local traditions and breeds, there is no explicit mention of it having Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot confirm that the cheese has PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3125 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative mentions that it's an example of an innovative small local producer of dried meat products. They work closely with local farmers, using old cows and other local products like 'AlpenP'. Hmm, AlpenP sounds like a product name, possibly related to Alpine or mountainous regions. 

Looking further, the value chain is described as being very meat-based, which might not align with current trends. The challenges faced are classified as predicted, and the VC is innovative in its marketing strategies, using e-commerce and trendy branding. However, the products themselves are traditional.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of cheese. It's all about dried meat products. PDO certification typically applies to specific cheeses that meet certain geographical and production criteria, like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Roquefort. Since there's no indication of cheese being part of this value chain, especially with a focus on meat products, I can conclude that cheese isn't involved here.

Therefore, the JSON should be empty because the mountain value chain doesn't involve cheese with PDO certification.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3048 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) where Spain ADEGUA is the reference member state, and the reference card ID is VC 05 ES. It mentions that around 400,000 bottles are produced each season from five distilleries, focusing on typical products like sweet and dry anise, rosoli, or pacharán. 

Looking further, it discusses the Local Administrative Unit (LAU) with specific statistics about agricultural holdings, population proximity, and sector employment shares. The primary product here is Rute brandy, also known as ruteño or anise from Rute. It's described as a dry aniseed brandy traditional to Cordoba, made through hydroalcoholic distillation using green anise seed (Pimpinella Anisum) from Malaga fields.

The narrative mentions the challenges faced by this sector, such as declining demand for higher alcohol beverages and industrial crisis in the seventies. It also notes that only five companies remain, indicating a shift in focus towards new products and marketing strategies to revitalize the sector. The VC is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation tied to introducing new products, cultural tourism, and synergies with other sectors like mantecados (a type of sweet) and hams.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on aniseed-flavored spirits, specifically brandy production. There's no indication that the value chain involves cheese at all, let alone cheese with PDO certification. PDO typically applies to products like certain types of cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort) where specific geographical and traditional factors contribute to their unique characteristics.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese or any dairy-related products, it's clear that this mountain value chain is about spirits, not cheese. Therefore, there's no need to include an "id" in the JSON response.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2891 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain centered around mountain viticulture on Etna volcano in Sicily. It mentions local producers adding value to their wines, selling them to tourists, and forming a basket of products from the territory. The primary sector shares are given, but I don't see any mention of cheese here. Instead, it's all about wine production—specifically, Vini Etna DOC, which is a wine with PDO certification.

The narrative discusses how wineries like Franchetti and Tasca d'Almerita have contributed to the success of Etna wines both domestically and internationally. It also talks about innovations in viticulture, such as understanding Nerello Mascarese grapes and using oak wood casks. There's mention of organic and biodynamic practices, along with support from institutions like Vini Etna DOC consortium for promotion.

Nowhere does the narrative refer to cheese or dairy products. The focus is entirely on wine, its production, marketing, and the economic impact on the region. Since there's no discussion about cheese, especially one that would require PDO certification, I can conclude that this value chain doesn't involve cheese with such a designation.

Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object because the narrative doesn't mention cheese with PDO.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2965 involves cheese with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative talks about Scotland's Highlands and Islands, focusing on deer hunting as a popular tourist activity. It mentions that the land is wild but managed for game hunting. There are statistics about GVA shares across sectors, with the tertiary sector being dominant. The primary sector, which would include agriculture, has a very small share.

The narrative also discusses vension meat and its quality, mentioning initiatives like Scottish Quality Wild Vensions to ensure high standards. It talks about estates using innovative methods for counting deer populations and managing habitats. However, there's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the text.

Since PDO certification is specifically related to products like cheese that have a specific geographical origin and traditional methods, but since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all, it can't involve PDO-certified cheese. The focus is entirely on hunting and meat quality, not dairy or cheese.
