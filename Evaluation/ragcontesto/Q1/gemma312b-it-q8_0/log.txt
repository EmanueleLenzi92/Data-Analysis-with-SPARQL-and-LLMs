Parmigiano Reggiano is one of the most famous italian production, The selection of parmigiano reggiano product in mountain want to valorise a product and the territories of production.   Parmigiano Reggiano POD mountain product, is stepped in the tradition and history of a small, thought abundantly diverse territory. Everything takes places on a specific area of Apennines mountain range, from the growing of animal fodder to the breeding of the cows that produce the milk used to make the cheese. The meadows are self regenerating fields, because they have not been plowed, in same cases, not even centuries. They protected the land and are a place of biodiversity, yielding up more than 60 different fodder types that are the key aspect for the cheese quality.    Pursuing the aims of the consortium, which concern the protection of the PDO of 'Parmigiano Reggiano' cheese, the supervision of production and trade, and the promotion of production in Italy and abroad, they can be further enhanced, increasing its image and notoriety in the world.

The farmer produces milk, dairy products (from cheese to yoghurt) and confectionery (e.g. parfaits and ice cream) in the 'Lessinia' regional park, in a mountainous area. Cows are for seven months in open-air grazing. The production is certificated 'mountain product' (MP) and labelled as 'Product in the Lessinia Regional Park'. In the farm shop, there is an area equipped with benches and a play area for children. The farm shop is also a tourist info point for the nature park. The farmer organizes educational workshops for schools. This VC is strictly linked to the natural settings of SES and its cultural dairy tradition. New productions related to the farm's milk are proposed (like ice creams) and information services on the park, too. The 'Latte del Parco' farm emphasises the authenticity, traditionality and naturalness of its products. However, this marketing strategy is not particularly stressed.   The farm uses the pastureland in the park for seven months and uses the natural and cultural landscape to distinguishing its production.    The VC intersects different sectors (i.e., confectionery) to enhance the milk and the naturalistic context. The complexity of productions and services could make the VC less competitive because milk and cheese are not certified as organic. More over, the production's territorial and historical identification is reported in a limited way. 'Latte del Parco' does not use all the potentialities of e-commerce.

The new products are the toursitic tours offered in the area and by the cider brewers. The new marketing strategies are linked to the PGI, as it was the first Norwegian alcoholic drink with a geographical indication.   The Hardanger fiord is a unique location for apple production due to the minerals that flow down from the mountain soils plus the unique climate that the Gulf Stream brings to this region, causing higher temperatures than in other locations of the same latitude. The apple production started back in the 13th century brought by British monks and soon the cider production started.

Honey is also a historical and cultural traditional food in this mountain area. Both of those aspects allowing the VC to be characterised by natural and cultural elements.    First, climate change is a significant challenge for honey production (both adverse effects on plants' biological cycles and the bees' ability to resist colder/warmer zones). Second, the honey market is quite competitive, and certification of origin or organic label can be insufficient without an appropriate marketing strategy designed by the farmer and promoter of certificate of origin (in this case, the Municipality of Amatrice).

Black pudding from Stornoway (Western Isles LAU1) has PGI status. Such puddings need to be made on the Isle of Lewis to a specific recipe. Charles MacLeod (original producers of Stornoway Black pudding) has won multiple awards including six Great Taste Awards.   Natural assets: relies on land use for livestock farming, also landscape/ scenery to link to tourism ventures (i.e. scottish breakfast puddings often served in tourist accomodation). Social assets: strong links throughout the VC including between farmer/crofter, butcher and touism provider. Cultural assets: Links to traditional knowledge for pudding production, but also crofting and livestock farming practices. Haggis and black pudding are also important cultural icons for Scottish food industry.    relies on tourism for a good market for selling produce (potential challenges from BREXIT/ COVID). Relies on good relations across the VC (i.e. farmers, pudding producers, tourism ventures, tourists). Relies on maintaining land use/ climate so it can be suitable for livestock farming - potential imapcts from climate change may alter this. Only Stornoway black pudding has PGI status, other pudding

Within this VC, one can find organic and farmer Picodon or convention dairy picodon production. Products: Some Picodon producers are working of goat meat valorisation (cabri, chevreau) Processes: Farmer Picodon producers are developping practices that provide ecosystemic services ecopasture, sylvopastoralism.   Cultural: Picodon is one of the most famous speciality in Drome departement which provide cultural asset: turistic attractivness, ancestral know-how, territorial identity, dedicated events. Natural: The AOP requirements guarantees production practices protecting middle mountain agriculture. Organic picodon producers also provide ecosystemic services: hampering fires thank to pasture practices, preservation of middle mountain agriculture.    Picodon AOP is a well-structured VC as goat-milk production is one of the top production in Drome which provide local economic value and territorial identity. However, this VC is very large and gather diverse producers: Farmers' Picodon producers often practice pastoralisme and Dairy Picodon producers working in dairy companies.

Pirotski kackavalj made it to the list of intangible cultural heritage of Serbia. Pure milk from Stara planina and salt are the basic ingredients. It holds reputation for its soft but recognisable taste deriving from the high quality mild from the mountain pastures, and aslo traditional manual process. The decline of livestock production makes it particulalry fragile when it comes to the quantities on the market and also know how.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.3.   The chestnuts and wines produced in ribeira Sacra, specially in the Quiroga-Bibei subzone, were historically know for their superior quality and provided a high economic yield. Despite these facts this area has suffered from demografic ageging as well as from a demographic decline. Most of the chestnut forest is currently abandoned and the vineyards are getting progressively abandoned as well because the people that upkeep them are ageging and there is not a continuity in this labors.   The microclimate of the Ribeira Sacra allows this region to produce some of the finest spanish wines. It also favours the chestnut production giving it a caliber and a sweet taste that are very valued in the market, specially for roasting.    The lack of formation on the maintenance and exploitation of both the chestnut and the vineyards represents a huge barrier for the incorporation of the local youth to the local value chains. Formation on the bussiness side of the activity is also required. Most of the grape producers lack formation on enology making it really hard to step up on their bussiness transforming it into more valuable goods as wine and liquor. Also the spread of Dryocosmus kuriphilus is damaging the productivity and viability of the local chestnut forest. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.70%.   During the 20th century the surface area of Savoyard vineyards was drastically reducted. In the 2000-s new generations of vine growers started the reconquest, with the reconstruction of vineyards that have disappeared in the mountains and on the steepest slopes.   The village high quality produces wines from Altesse (unique local variety existing only on this territory) which are sold under the Roussette de Savoie appellation (specifically under the Marestel cru title). The highest slopes of coteaux Marestel above the village have excellent soil characteristics and mesoclimate for the late-ripening, low-yielding Altesse variety.    The main challenge was to reconstruct from zero the 25 ha of vineyard on the steep slope (50-60%) of the coteaux Marestel, historically known as a good spot for high quality wine production, which was abandoned due to the demographic dynamics of the 20Th century and due to the difficulties connected to the mountain wine production (manual work, steep slopes).

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.27%.   The dairy, owned by a local cooperative of farmers, collects and processes the milk produced by 24 local farmers to produce Italian and local cheeses. For the production of the traditional Friulian cheese called 'Montasio', the dairy obtained in 2011 the certification 'denomination product of origin (DPO) and 'mountain product' (MP) label. In this case, the VC is strongly linked to the natural (pasture, mountain, cows, etc.) and cultural (cheese production, mountain culture, etc.) elements of the SES. The dairy's products are traditional, and innovations include adopting quality certificates and some 'new products' (but based on the food local tradition). This guarantees a competitive advantage in the market. In the dairy shop, local cheeses and milk are offered, and various other products from local and regional producers. Some of these products use cheeses from dairy (e.g. 'Frico').   The SES is involved in the VC for several reasons. The grasslands and cultivated land are used for foraging dairy cattle (exclusively Italian Red Fleckvieh cattle). The cultural dimension is involved in the production skills related to traditional cheese making in the Friuli region. From a social viewpoint, cooperative organisational forms to face economic problems are common.    The market of dairy products is very competitive due to the presence of a wide variety of cheese. Product and process innovation is relevant for competitiveness, but this VC innovation appears limited to the acquisition of quality certificates (e.g. DPO and MP). Moreover, the dairy's reference market is local (the cooperative has its point of sale in Malborghetto Valbruna), where other typical products of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region are also proposed. Recently, home delivery sales have been adopted for a limited area. These

Can the reputation of a traditional mountain product be the object of a value chain shared with other actors of the larg sector (external or internal to the mountain)? What are the conditions of this sharing? The interest of this value chain is to analyze the coexistence of activities mobilizing a reputation value considered unique but having very different possible and negative impacts on 'SES'. The case expresses the relationships between value chains associated with mountain production and the local economy (non-mountain). Is it possible to design connections and under what conditions ? How do you think about sharing a reputation that originates from the mountains areas with other neighboring areas?.   The challenge for the sector is to link up with local breeders who supply meat adapted to the needs of mid-range deli meats and to link this production to local resources (acorns, cereals, other agricultural and agri-food resources). It responds to another issue of controlling costs and prices in an eco-conditionality situation (food inputs, effluents, etc.). Benchmarking issue towards production systems of the Italian 'suino pesante' type. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. This is a socio-technical innovation absent from Corsica: - new ways of raising animals (' suino pesante type') to provide meat suitable for dry sausages. - search for a form of organization an

It is innovative VC in term of its marketing sing regional name and references to mountain ('tradittional cake from Vallachian region in Beskydy).   It is the whole locality symoblically specified - Vallachian region. The cake is known for 200 years but its popularity is because of the link to this region (the region sells doue to the symbol of the territory related to mountains) - region is the symbolic asset.    The cake utilises the regional name ('Vallachian'), it means the VC rotates about the name of the territory (not around the process of production or raw materials used) linked with the region of Beskydy mountains. The Beskydy mouniains are linked with the name Vallachian (valašský, lašský in Czech). Because of the popularity of this cake (e.g. sold on farm marekts throughout Czechia or in supermarkets) it faces problems with fake products of similar type (using name 'frgále' but not being form the locality).

The VC aims on production of herb liquers of various flavours. The liquers are presented as a regional product. The VC is utilizes symbolic assets of the region. Alhough this product is not unique of mountain regions, it is a great example of utilizing natural and symbolic values associated with the region. In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the liquers are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area. The symbolic value refering to the mountains is what distingusihes the product from other similar products.    Herb liquers are sold on mainstream food markets that are highly competetive. Main challenge for the given VC is associated with valorization of the product and with a marketing strategy. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 SER. Mountain trount value chain is nationally fragmented and dominated by small actors, with capacity of up to 1000m2. Out of this number many are not even registered. Their production ranges from very extnensive to semi intensive, and intensive, from lack of any mechanisation and treatment to fully organised fishpond productions. Fresh fish is sold usually localy and through HORECA sector, while bigger facilities are starting processing and packaging for more remote markets, as demain is increasing. The organic production is underdeveloped though an interesting niche market. Linkages with tourism are strong not only outlets for the final product, but also in promotion of sport fishery in the mountain regions which are in case of Bajina Basta protected as Natural Park and cross border regions of Drina river watershead. Some companies are even having their operations in both countries (Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia) using the best locations for the production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Dinarid mountains, mountain Tara. Heavily relying on the natural capacity of the mountain springs and waterflwos the trout production is very conditioned and interlinked with the fresh mountain water ecosystesm. There are several considerations to note, starting from the almost full conversion to production of invasive species such as RAinbow or California trout, to intensification of production in trout fish farms and in cages. Due to a water shortage in the summer period, as well as lack of aeration and oxygenation systems, production on a number of farms is 10 to 20 kg/m3, which means that farms only operate at partial capacity. Still this is considered to be a very high quality protein food and due to the strong potential for income diversification in mountain areas, as well as the market demand from HORECA, it is often a small scale bussines placed close to touristic areas nature protected regions all over Western Balkans. The production practices can be improved to reduce environemntal impacts to minimum. Apart from fresh fish there is processing by smoking, making fillets or pate which adds further value to the product. There is strong reputation and image of the product linked to the mountain regions and landscapes that can further power the gro

Sheep husbandry is a typical VC that can be found on numerous mountain areas all over the Czech Republic. The sheep husbandry is very similar to the goat husbandry, however less common in terms of presence. Sheep dairy products represent a specific market niche. The products are highly demanded. The VC is typical of using organic farming methods and creating additonal process-baseed quality of the food products. The mountain areas and symboliv value of the region contributes to valorization of these food products. Sheep husbandry bring many positive effects in term of ecology, since the farms often employ specific grazing managements.   VC directly utilizes natural assets of the given locality (grassland, high nature value farming areas). Sheep are capable of using grassland in areas that may not be used by other ruminants (cattle, goats). At the same time farms located in mountain region also utilize the symbolic value of the territory. The mountains are associted with 'purity' and 'nature' and this association is typically used in the promotion of the food products from the given VC.    The sheep dairy products create unique niche market. The assets are very specific. Main challenge for the farms is associated with succesful mar

The Di Nucci dairy is a very old family company (dated 1662) that produce typical local cheese (e.g., Caciocavallo cheese). The production cycle is performed using only local raw materials establishing fair economic collaboration with local breeders (who supply the milk according to high quality and environmental sustainability standards). The marketing strategy also stresses the link between the Di Nucci dairy with Alto Molise's cultural and rural tradition (like the practice of transhumance) and supporting sustainable development initiatives. The company as a clear vocation for internationalization, oriented towards the haute cuisine sector and experiential tourism (e.g., dairy crafts museum). A new marketing strategy emphasises the family and territorial tradition that makes the product 'unique'. At the same time, the Di Nucci promoted collaboration with local actors, both farmers and institutions, playing a relevant (or even pivotal) role in local development strategy.   The territorial context (in its natural and cultural-historical settings) is engaged in the value chain through both dairy craft skills and cow breeding. Here a social value exchange where a form of cooperation prevails between the different actors involved in the Vcs.    The vocation to internationalization can compromise the 'artisanal' dairy tradition, and the increased request for milk may stress the local environment. The development of the tourism dimension also depends on local institutions and collaboration among local actors. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current.

Natural assets - reliant on timber which grows on shoulders of upland mountain areas. Also steady climate and maintained land use. Social assets: good relations amongst those in the VC including timber producer, land managers, bespoke carpenters and tourism busineeses. Cultural assets: traditional knowledge for traditional handcrafted timber production methods, and links to the cultural heritage of the area (i.e., knowledge of local trees and how best they can be used).

Since the middle of the 20th century, a flourishing value chain dedicated to the production of mantecados has been consolidated. The three main bakeries employ more than three hundred people, many of them women. The production of vegan sweets and vegetable fats is an increasingly prominent line of business. Simultaneously, the innovative proposal of artistic chocolate representations, the opening of exhibition spaces and points of sale and the collaboration with other sectors (liquors and hams) attract almost 100,000 visitors to the town in the run-up to Christmas.   The wide range of products uses ingredients such as lard, almonds, sugar, and flour. Most of the raw material is acquired outside the place of production. The traditional productive spaces have been joined by museums and shops that, together with other sites, generate a thematic park of Christmas products.    Diet changes aimed at reducing animal fats and sugar consumption have led to changes in production and the appearance of new products, trying to keep a consumer offer linked to a traditional holiday such as Christmas competitive. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Breaking the seasonality of production is another great challenge. The diversification of the offer and the appearance of new services are considered useful tools for this challenge.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 45 CH2. The VC is very short and includes farmers and potentially resellers in local markets as raw milk cannot be stored for a long time and is mainly sold directly.   The refe
etter price per litre for the farmer, prevalence of landuse systems through pasture (cattle grazing) in the swiss mountains. Raw milk is not a new product because it has always been consumed in this way in rural areas, but it can represent a new strategy for selling milk, more natural and above all sold directly (the consumer's desire to consume locally and not processed).   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest.    Conservation is a challenge since raw milk must be sold quickly as it cannot be stored at room temperature for several days. The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Raw milk is a return to earlier and traditional forms of milk, which may represent innovation as it stands out from contemporary and industrial milk consumption. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   The sale of raw milk takes place throughout Switzerland, mainly in the mountain regions near the grazing areas.

Weizer Schafbauern (Sheep farmers from Weiz) is cooperative of about 300 sheep farmers in the district of Weiz within the LEADER region Almenland-Energieregion Gleisdorf . They produce meat (lamb is the main product), milk and milk products (cheese, yogurt, cream) of different varieties and cosmetics. The wool is also used for textiles. They have different marketing relations (direct marketing, online shop, supermarket, ). The Weizer mountain lamb is classified as traditional food in Austria. The sheep plays a crucial role for the maintenance of small structured extensive farming in this region. In 1994 the cooperative was founded in order to provide a better base of the processing and marketing of the farmers products. The brand Määh is of importance for the joint marketing. Products are available via direct selling but also in the supermarket chain SPAR and in local restaurants and high class gastronomy. The lamb is the flagship product of the Weizer Schafbauern.   Sheep farming has a tradition since the middle age especially in areas where cattle cannot graze. In cooperation with ALMO farmers, free range pig farmers and a local butcher the Weizer Schafbauern have bought the old regional slaughter house, which was then rebuild in line with the EC regulation for organic certification. In important asset is the cultural landscape of the region, which is important for hiking tourism.    Farmers in the mountain region struggle to have sufficient income. The cooperative aims to secure income and to share certain production resources and to have a joint marketing.

It is 70 km long and renowned for its spectacular scenery consisting of rugged crags and towers / pillars of rock along its entire length. In places the walls of the gorge are up to 300 metres high.    The challenges associated with this value chain are the typical issues with visitor management experienced by popular touristic hotspots in mountain areas. Because of the landscape there are relatively few good viewing points along the gorge and these quickly become congested by parked vehicles.

Lanjarón is a brand of natural mineral water owned by Aguas Danone, SA (a Danone Group company), which comes from the Salud spring in Lanjarón in the Sierra Nevada massif in the province of Granada, where it is also bottled. Lanjarón water is very weakly mineralised. All Lanjarón bottles will be made of recycled plastic by 2021. Besides, they will use a new cap format that remains attached to the bottle. Since its birth, commitment to the environment has been associated with Lanjarón natural mineral water, given its privileged origin. For years, Lanjarón has been dedicating part of its profits to financing different actions to fight against waste disposal and in favor of the circular economy and against depopulation and other socio-ecological problems.   Mineral waters have established by law a perimeter of protection, an aquifer recharge zone, keeping under control human, industrial, and livestock activities as long as they do not affect the quantity or quality of the mineral water. Some waters have the added protection of being born in a National Park, such as the Sierra Nevada.    Faced with a private company's business challenges, the company is committed to the environmental and global challenges of our society. Specifically, in the case of Lanjarón, this represents a commitment to nature, reducing the impact of industrial activity, protecting the environment, and promoting the use of sustainable materials and packaging.

The VC is a classic example of the alternative food network. Most of the meat production is carried out on farms that specialize in animal husbandry. Processing their farm products enables farms to gain higher added value from their farming activities. Meat products from such VCs are currently highly attractive even for mainstream consumers. Producerts are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products and try to valorize symbolic features of the mountain region (such as 'pure nature', 'traditions' etc.).

The Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve is one of the few that keep the charcoal industry alive. In 2014, thanks to the collaboration between the charcoal makers grouped in the 'Asociación Charamusco Carboneros de la Cumbre' and the technicians of the Environmental Service of the Cabildo, the brand CARBÓN DE LA CUMBRE was registered.   La Cumbre charcoal is made from raw material from the dry wood of species that grow spontaneously (almond and broom) and without any chemical products.    The main challenge is to make sustainable a small artisanal production, linked to the forest's local resources with the industrial type commercial offers that flood the market with very cheap charcoal offers. On the other hand, maintaining in this context the interest of charcoal makers in a complementary and economically unprofitable activity is another critical challenge, together with the need to carry out a regenerative practice of the forest and not an extractive one. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although it provides innovative nuances by linking an associative structure that brings together the charcoal producers in collaboration with the institution responsible for the Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve, this is a traditional value chain. On the other hand, Carbón de La Cumbre intends to obtain the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certificate for good practice

The forest covers a very large part of the Jura mountain (together with the pastures) and therefore represents a large prevalence of landuse systems. The forest area should not be reduced in favour of built-up or agricultural area, as it is extremely protected in Switzerland. The sustainable development of the forest is therefore extremely important for the development of the Swiss Jura mountains.   Forests are a local asset and depend strongly on natural conditions (change in rainfall, temperature, soils, slope, etc.). In Switzerland, forests are managed by legal bases guaranteeing sustainable exploitation in the framework of forestry planning.    Wood production is threatened by natural hazards such as drought increased by climate change (in addition to the shallow, calcareous soil), as well as the bark beetle. A major transformation in the composition of forests is expected. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.

The cheese is produced only with milk from the 'Podolica' cow which is a local breed. The processing relies on tranditional activities which are mostly performed
 market trait of rurality which is affected by ageing population and depopulation. The remoteness of the area make it difficult for the active part of the population to share formal and informal knowledges and experiences that can promote the valorisation of local natural (busheses, woods, and natural grass land) and human (traditional know-how) resources . Additionaly, intensive agriculture production drastically reduced the areas dedicated to natural land, natural grassland, and thus, the activities connected with traditional livestock activities such as the 'transumanza'. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The cheese is moinly produced on farm with very few number of larger processors in the territory and thus a limited amount of product available for the market. For these reasons, producers are exploring alternative marketing strategies besides local markets, such as e-commerce and on farm selling (usually coupled with agritourism actvities).

The VC aims on production of syrups of various flavours. The syrups are presented as a regional product that uses herbs and fruits collected in mountains. It also refers to traditonal recipes for preparing the syrups. Alhough this product is not unique of mountain regions, it is a great example of utilizing natural and symbolic values associated with the region. In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the syrups are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area. The symbolic value refering to the mountains is what distingusihes the product from other similar products.    Syrups are sold on mainstream food markets that are highly competetive. Main challenge for the given VC is associated with valorization of the product and with a marketing strategy. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land.

Aquaculture in Romania is dominated by semi-extensive production of common carp in the lowland regions. Farming and processing of trout in the mountains is a more recent development but enjoys a growing market for fresh trout and processed products, as well as integration with various forms of mountain tourism (e.g. 'catch-and-cook'). The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' is a good example of a trout farm (https://www.pastravariabusteni.ro/) located in a mountain area (the Prahova River Valley) that is popular with tourists and therefore has a thriving business in direct sales of fresh trout and trout products - all registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT).   The key natural asset for a trout farm such as this is a clean (unpolluted) source of water - in this case, a local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales.

The company Melise is a result of a successful collaboration process among local actors and an external one that established a profitable local value chain on growing, processing and selling organic apples cultivated in abandoned lands. Here positive environmental (e.g., reduction of soil erosion), economic (like job opportunities) and social (e.i., chance to not emigrate) aspects are evident. Melise is also involved in other projects on honey production, 'agricultural' beer and rural tourism. New products are marketed (apples, also indigenous varieties, as fruit, jams, fruit juices, etc.) and a new production process is implemented (organic farming), and the territory, as a natural and socio-cultural context, is enhanced as a quality brand.   The abandoned lands and the socio-cultural context has been involved in a new value chain through a cooperation process that has extensively exploited an uncommon fruit production for the area.    The competition on the organic and local products market is high and the company aims to growth the commitment in food processing and for recover the traditional byotipes of apple trees. This requires new skills and business models. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.

Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Which cheese to produce ? How to process milk ? How to produce milk ? Those are questions that can be answered individually or collectively (common-pool resources such as summer pastures and pastoral surfaces, local breeds, etc.). Those choices can be in continuity with local tradition and know-how, or not. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Dairy husbandry and production of Cheese is observable in every other MRLs. On-farm cheese making is not a specificity of Corsica, but its anteriority is remarkable. Its current expressions gives us insight about how tradition and novelty can interact and produce resilience for territories in recession.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 34.50%.   'Pastrama de Oaie' is a very traditional and widespread mountain product. This example is produced by a family farming in the mountains above the town of Novaci (78258) in Gorj County (RO412). It is very well-known by local tourists and is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/pastrama-oaie-stana-stefanu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Pastrama de Oaie' is the semi-natural and alpine grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing) in the mountain areas of Gorj County (RO412). Many of the communal pastures used for grazing sheep and cattle are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and associated dairy products and the consumption of sheepmeat is steadily declining due to changing consumer preferences. 'Pastrama de Oaie' continues to maintain a very specific niche in the market since it is very seasonal and especially sought after for traditional summer barbecues / grills. However, products such as this rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are an increasing number of specialist butcher shops looking for good quality local meat products), but this also brings additional challenges for traditional small-scale businesses - including compliance with food hygiene and safety rules. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Chicken production belongs among examples of small-scale farms located in the mountain region Sumava. Chicken husbandry and chicken meat production creates important linkage with urban areas, because there is a hugh demand for chicken meat that comes from un-conventional farms. Specialized farms are often detached from plant production, since they buy feedstuff for the chickens. Chicken producers develop specific niche that competes with industrial large-scale farms. Some farms are trying to certify their farm process and refer to a specific quality scheme. However, these examples are quite rare. The small-scale farms of this kind are very important for elaborating local food production that valorizes local assets. One of the key challenges for the VC would be the localization of inputs that are used for feeding chickens. Despite the traditional nature of the VC, there is a potential for innovating marketing strategy just like in case of other alternative food networks.

Berries grow naturally in this environment so its market-oriented production is a possibility for local economies to thrive. The pick up yourself format can be seen as a marketing strategy as they are selling the whole experience of harvesting your own fresh raspberries. The new products relate to the frozen raspberries and the variety of juices they offer. Although these products already have extisted out there, it is interesting how they have integrated all those options in a family business.   The main asset of this VC is the cooperation between producers of the valley under the association AUK - SMAKER FRA STJØRDALSFØRET. They share values of sustainability and care for the valley and for the tastes that come from it. Berries are the natural asset for this VC.    The big challenge is to compete with greenhouse berry production, big Norwegian companies and the import market. Besides, global warming may bring new patogens and diseases to Nordic latitudes, and thus, production without spraying may become even more challenging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.

The gofio of the Canary Islands is a product elaborated mainly from millet or wheat. Its origin is Berber, and the aborigines of the Canary Islands mostly consumed it. In ancient times, different types of gofio were made using ingredients such as wheat, lentils, barley, and even fern rhizomes. After the Canary Islands' conquest, the variety of cereals grew, since until then, only wheat and barley were used. After the discovery of America, it also began to be made with corn or millet. Some mills have outstanding heritage resources related to the history of gofio production. Others, such as the Molino del Fuego in Telde, are more than one hundred years old. There is a whole cultural and social tradition around gofio in the gastronomy and food of the Canary Islands that has spread to other South American and African countries.   Paradoxically, almost all the raw material are grown abroad. Thus, many mills use mixtures of cereals grown outside the islands or send the local millet seed to distant countries such as Argentina, from where they then receive the grain. The small area of millet grown in the municipality of Telde is often used as cattle feed. In some cases, such as in the Biosphere Reserve on the island of La Palma, a social initiative carries out the entire process. The Canary Islands Government has declared 'El Molino del Conde,' located in Telde, Gran Canaria, an Asset of Cultural Interest.    Consumption seems to remain stable, and even the catering industry and other processed foods are beginning to introduce gofio flour in their offer, while production by the mills remains stable. However, there have been critical mom

Fly fishing is a traditional practice in Scandinavia due to the water streams that fow along its mountains and valleys with clean and cold water. These characteristics are important for the VC as trouts and other salmonid fishes find in these waters their natural habitat.   The natural assets are the five rivers and 18 lakes where fly fishing can be practiced in Hemsedal. All of them are healthy ecosystems with high quality waters, which make them ideal habitats for trouts. The social assets are all the values that underpin this activity regarding respect for the animals and their habitats, the use of specific techniques and tools and proper behaviour. Finally, fly fishing represents a traditional practice for many anglers that have learnt it from the previous generations and have been doing it during their whole lives.    Climate change may be the main challenge for this VC. Water streams in Nordic areas are expected to suffer more floods and changes in water temperature with the consequent impact on the micro biota and biochemical processes that occur in water. Therefore, water quality and biochemical parameters may change, thus altering the whole water ecosystem. Trouts and salmons are the main fish species for fly fishing in this area. Although both are quite sensible to these changes, trouts are lower thermal tolerance, hence being more vulnerable under this scenario. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Mountain rivers and lak

Award for the most beautiful farm up to 500ha; Award for a company with a turnover of up to 2 million euros. One of the local assets is the clean environment in mountain areas. Thee-commerce is also related to this VC. Organic production requires more handwork. Thus this kind of production contributes to local employment. It is a good example of crop production in mountain areas rending a good quality of mountain environment and respecting natural consitions.   Natural assets are cropland with herbs production, meadows for local herbs collection, and forests for berries collection. The social asset is a social recognition of organic farming's importance and willingness to pay higher prices for bio-quality products. The cultural asset is traditional knowledge about the health effects of local plant species and agricultural production in a local biophysical context without chemicals.    1) climate change and related environmental quality changes can influence the quality of producing herbs and fruits. 2) organic production requires more handwork (e.g., hand skinning, hand-harvesting), but the herbs' production is seasonal. 3) Due to the processing and storage of organic food without chemicals, their storage life is shorter. It requires more frequent processing, packaging, distribution, etc. At the same time, the organic food needs to be controlled at all production and processing stages.

 such as honey, are used for production, but historically other products come from other SESs. Thus the VC connects several SES. However, strong connections with local agricultural production are not stressed.    In the high-quality traditional confectionery sector, innovation and the origin of raw materials are competitive factors. In the case of 'Di Iorio', innovation crosses local (i.e., nougat) and national (panettone, Easter eggs, dove bread, etc.) gastronomic culture. However, the origin of the raw materials is not always local. Although this is not in contradiction with the local tradition (since the Romans time, the SES is connected by trades with distant areas), it may pose a problem in communication strategies. For example, in the case of nougat, traditionally, almonds come from the Apulia region while honey is local.

They are produced in the same way throughout the whole defined area. The exact breeds of sheep are grazed in the entire designated area, with the same flora and climatic conditions, which results in the same quality of the basic raw material - sheep's milk.

Sheep and cows pasture in mountain areas maintain specific land use and landscape scenery. Sheep pasture in Slovak mountains is traditional and thus has also a cultural value.    1) The pasture presence in mountains has been declining mainly due to socio-demographic and economic changes. The pasture decline also impacts land-use changes towards pasture lands' afforestation and, consequently, causes ecological changes in vegetation composition. 2) In recent years, globalization has affected even the traditional cheese production in Slovakia. Several producers started to import, especially during the winter, the sheep's milk from other European countries located more in the South of Europe. The cheaper imported sheep milk is not originating from grazed sheep but sheep fed in the barn for better milk yield. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted.

There are many local and regional stakeholder organizations (ADEM/PNR/FDO..) requesting support to address these issues through ecological, economic and social impact assessment of VC and support to change practices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. - local valorization, creation of added value, local economic organization on the territory: Local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to the consumer or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron' allows to produce value on the territory. - production of innovative ecosystem services provided in the mountains (silvopastoralism). The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and water. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 54.60%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 7.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 37.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 55.10%.   Pester plateau is a Special nature reserve area. Family farming is prevailing, sheep are grazed at natural pastures. Sjenica lamb meat, dry meat products and sheep Sjenica cheese have reputation of high quality. Sjenica sheep cheese is also PDO. The area is well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products. Sheep meat has very strong reputation in the country, as well as abroad (region and traditional markets / Muslim countries). There are potentials to protect PDO product at the EU level and have direct export with the label. Adding value to the products by certifying organic production, and/or other certificates that are in line with nature protection are of a great potential. Additionally, connecting the products with sustainable tourism (rural tourism) and other channels for selling these products (e-commerce) creates potential for avoiding low prices and selling animals. Reopening of export to countries asking for halal meat (Middle East, Turkey, etc.) is slowly increasing. Rising interest of young people to be involved in the livestock production creates possibilities for new approaches to traditional farming and product marketing. Sjenica and Tutin areas have higher percentage of young people than other mountainous regions.   Key local assets are multi-cultural area, with strong connections to the neighbouring countries Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Traditional knowledge on livestock farming and production of traditional products (cheese, dry meat) is kept in large multi-generational families. Strong connection to the cultural and national heritage. High level of entrepreneurial spirit reputation of healthy area, food and hospitality.

The cooperative provides an income basis for the mountain farmers which is also of importance regarding the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape, which has value for to
ve having a better income and improved marketing options. On the other side the landscape and the small size of mountain farms is an important asset for BioAlpin to promote regional, organic products in Tyrol. The cooperation among farmers as well as the cooperation with M-Preis at eye-level allows knowledge transfer and innovation. Traditional knowledge as well as innovation plays a crucial role for BioAlpin.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce the cooperative gives them a structure for a better marketing and income. Climate change is a challenge for vegetable/fruit farmers in regard the increasing heat (and heat waves) and thus for irrigation. For pasture farms climate change regards mostly biodiversity and is a logistically challenge because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Bio vom Berg exists since 2002 as a brand of the BioAlpin cooperative. This cooperative allows democratic decision making, coordination of the production and the development of new products in order to secure the income of the farmers. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is of special interest because of it s actors structure and governance of these structure. However, it doesn t meet the criteria in regard to the mountain landscapes system. That s why data in section 3 are provided at NUTS-2 level, since this VC also extends the boundaries of a NUTS-3 region.

The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' began selling fresh (eviscerated) Rainbow Trout in 2018 and has since diversified into the processing and sale of a broad range of additional products
 local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified.

Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 78.20%.   The company has large relevance for the Sicilian economy. It produces both traditional and PDO-certified cheeses as well as standard products in the cheese sector, like mozzarella cheese. It uses local milk (sheep and cow milk) for high quality products and, if necessary, it is also uses extra-regional milk for standard productions. Milk comes from selected farms. The company is certified with various production quality labels (like BRC and IFS certificates) and it is active in the large-scale retail trade and the Ho.re.ca. sector for the local market. The innovation refers to both Sicilian PDO products and special cheeses like low-fat or lactose-free cheeses. In particular, products like the Provola cheese of Nebrodi is used in the marketing strategy to characterized the company as a producer of traditional Sicilian cheeses.   The company has a commercial relevance for the whole Sicilian dairy sector due to its large production. The cultural elements linked to the dairy tradition are incorporated into the industrial process to offer PDO cheeses and other local products.    Zappalà offers a wide selection of cheese to satisfy different types of consumers, both looking for high quality and certified products and those less interested in these aspects. The milk is collected in the entire regional territory and, if necessary, comes from the extra-regional areas. In this sense, several SES are concerned by the VC. The milk and cheese market is quite competitive, and it requires both a continuous proposal of new products and to enlarge the selling market. For these reasons, some doubt were arisen on the non-transparency on milk's origin, specifically for traditional cheese production, like the Provola cheese of Nabrodi. It shows a difficult connection between the large-scale retail trade, dair

The fame of Corsican honey is old but its contemporary reputation results from the professionalization of the activity since 1980 and subsequently from a recognition consecrated by obtaining a PDO in 1998. The PDO brings together six honeys, four of which are produced from the spontaneous flora of the maquis. Except in winter, which is the season during which bee colonies rest, there is one honeydew per season. The definition of honey and its controls are based upon its taste and pollen analyzes, reflecting the foraging areas (heather, asphodel, lavender, broom, oaks, anthilli, thyme, etc.). The value of honey is very directly linked to the management of apiaries in a set of varied environments exposed to climate change. The location of the apiaries is strategic for the production of different honeys, especially those located in the mountains. The value is therefore dependent on the melifer and pollen potential of the foraging areas and the ability of beekeepers to choose the right locations.   The weak industrialization of Corsica and the way in which apiaries are managed, which use several layers of vegetation, are the assets. They also show as many dependencies to the local environment as there are types of vegetations/forageing areas, and as many potential vulnerabilities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.

In addition to other vegetables and herbs, peeled seedless pumpkins began to be grown in Boldva, in the framework in a public employment based social enterprise, giving livelihood to poor, disadvantaged social groups (mainly Roma). A small processing plant, including high tech solar drying equipment was built, branding, design, a small shop was developed and short food chains approached with the products in the area. The municipality initiated this project, which is not common, there is a high level of co-operation and community spirit in the village in the framework of a social enterprise. The products are traditional, however, well designed and packaged for wealthy customers, sold through short chains. They imply solar energy during production and processing and use social networks and ICT for marketing.   The VC uses the natural resources of the area, they cultivate a pumpkin plantation to produce raw material for the pumpkin seed oil and also produce herbs. The cooperation within the village, the support of the local authority, the local human resources are cornerstones of the project. They have become part of the local territorial quality assurance system.

In the Piacenza province has an average yearly production of 24 million bottles of wine, with an average selling price slightly above 4 €/bottle. The foothill production of Colli Piacentini PDO is able to obtain higher prices, but often barely enough to compensate the greater production costs and the lower yield that are chracteristic of high slope viticulture. There is a strong need in creating added value on wine of the region. The most dynamic situation can be found in Val Nure and Val Trebbia, where all the production is coming from family owned estates, most under organic certified production and used to joint promotional activities. Many wineries in these valleys have already reached high technical quality and outstanding reputation on the national and international markets. In this environment, the elevation toward mountains of the vineyard is a trend that started about 10 years ago with some pioneers, and that is presently taken in consideration by several wineries.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is 0. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is TRAVO. Colli Piacentini is a portion of the Appenninian mountain chain in Northen Italy. The Colli Piacentini ('Hills of Piacenza') is an Italian wine region located at the western end of Emilia-Romagna. In 1967, it was given the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) quality designation. Within its boundaries are several smaller DOCs including Colli Piacentini Gutturnio, Monterosso Val D'Arda DOC, Trebbianino Val Trebbia DOC and Val Nure del Colli Piacentini DOC. The region has a long history of winemaking with fossilized vine roots and grape seeds excavated from the region showing viticulture taking place as early as 2000 BC. In Roman times, Julius Caesar's father-in-law Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, grew grapes in the Piacenza hills. The Colli Piacentini was once considered part of the Piedmont wine region. To the northwest is the Lombardy wine region of Oltrepò Pavese and, like Oltrepò Pavese, the wine industry of the Colli Piacentini has had strong historical ties to the wine markets of Milan. The region produces over 17 different wines ranging from Vin Santo dessert wines to slightly sparkling frizzante wines.

The ownership of the herd is quite special, being the municipality who is in charge of the expenses and also the management of the whole activity. In addition, adding value to this traditional activity with the School of Sheperds and the touristic packages is an innovation in the value chain of small-scale goat production.   1) Abandonment of traditional practices and jobs (sheperd) due to societal and structural changes (demography, modern life style, global markets, competitivity, etc.); 2)Economic profitability; 3) Conflicts with livestock producers in getting access to natural resources (those producers consider the herd as a recreative activity and less important than their meat bussinessess); 4) Finding an interested group of people that may take care of the herd.

The land use for animal breeding (sheep and goats) is predominant in an area with close proximity to the forest of Rouvas. The SES of the area depends on a series of activites based on livestock, which interconect with the production of xinochondros, an integral part of the diet of the mountaineers of Crete and a favourite ingredient of the Cretan cuisine. Livestock in the wider area of Anogeia focuses mainly on dairy sheep and goats breeds, although the traditional sheep/goat breading has become economically unprofitable and heavily dependent on the European subcidies. Ksinochondros, a relatively high priced product, can give a prospect to the graziers. It is a traditional product, not well known in the new generation of consumers.

In some cases, the activity has been diversified by combining beef cattle breeding and the opening of a restaurant.   Horses are bred extensively, they grow and develop in a natural environment, where altitude, rain, rocky terrain and winter cold give them a special strength. Nature itself prepares them to be functional and strong. There are two cattle farms with 450 and 650 hectares respectively.

For many years potatos were considered as a commodity product with a basic price. Only the last years, to mitigate the reduction of per capita consuption, were introduce new marketing strategies based on the traciability of the product thanks to the valorisation of local productions. By improving the profitability conditions of mountain agri-food production it is possible to generate positive effects on the mountain territory by reducing its depopulation.   The research project, done under the RDP 4 , intends to provide the operators of the 'Montese Potato' value chain with some useful tools to improve the perceived value of their mountain product. In fact, with the adoption of the European brand 'Mountain Product' in conjunction with the 'Patata di Montese' brand, producers can improve the brand awareness of their customers and therefore the perceived value of their products. Furthermore, referring to the product packaging and distribution phase, the project aims to identify the packaging system and coordinate the collaboration with the distribution to increase the penetration of distribution in the points of sale and support producers in the development of appropriate marketing activities.    The farm located in mountain area as: Azienda Agricola Terrasanta, Azienda Agricola Veranatura, Azienda Agricola Belvedere and Azienda Agricola Farini d'Olmo have start to introduce new marketing strategies , using the label 'Mountain Product' (Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 AT. Styria beef is a premium beef product of organic farmers from Styria. Their homepage states that 'Styria beef' is only available on-farm, small food shops, high class gastronom
given. However, Styria beef can be seen as a community since there is exchange among the farmers from the different regions. Further, the 'natural landscapes' are a key asset in the marketing of Styria beef. The feeding is used as argument for the special taste of the beef.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce Styria Beef provides in this regard a niche by producing and selling a premium product. Climate change is a challenge for pasture farms mostly in regard to biodiversity and logistically because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Some alpine pastures are used as ski slopes which is an overall challenge that might change in the course of climate change. An increasing artificial snow infrastructure is a challenge in regard to the 'beauty of the landscape. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The invention of 'Styria Beef' was a reaction due to the lack of quality beef products in the late 1980s in Austria. Styria beef has not only been representing itself as a new brand, but has set new standards in regard to animal welfare (suckler cow husbandry) that are now common in mountain farming practices in Austria. The innovation is related to New product and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural and social.   There are some farmers from the neighbouring federal states of Carinthia and Lower Austria supplying Styria beef.

The Almenland small local diary produces various types of cheese (cow, sheep, goat all milk from the region: pasture farming and hay), which then is further processed by the Al
ly to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth. Another challenge refers to upscaling: the quantity of production is limited, while at the same time the demand is increasing also internationally. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Specific processing: the cheese is matured in the tunnel of the former silver mine. Some types for a quite long time (1.5 years); the cheese is only mad from local hey milk, and many different types of cheese are produced. Participation in international cheese competitions: several awards have been achieved: e.g. the 'Arzberger Ursteirer' was even vice world champion in the USA. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural.   Cheese is produced in many other regions in the Austrian Alps; some of them are also made from hay milk; the maturing in a former silver mine is unique.

It is the first stone fruit to reach the market, adapting very well to cold climates and high altitude cultivation. The diversity of varieties facilitates a staggered production and harvest, generating employment and boosting complementary economy in Sierra Sur and Sierra Mágina in the province of Jaén. Innovation is at a basic level and refers to initiatives in an initial stage of development and sectoral articulation strategies also in the initial launching phase.   In the Sierra Sur and Sierra Mágina, up to 9 different varieties are grown (Lamper, Burlat, Summit, Van..), thanks to the suitability of the soils and climate.    The main challenge is to improve sales prices to the industry, which do not cover production costs and represent 70% of the crop.

Thanks to grazing, the forests are kept free of fires, and the fields thrive. Animal welfare is fundamental in organic livestock farming, so it is extensive in order calves to be raised in semi-freedom, where they fatten up thanks to their mother's milk, pasture and organic cereals fodder.    The main challenge is to consolidate after four years of operation amid the current health and economic crisis, a short market channel offering the product directly to consumers or through highly specialized commercial channels committed to the same food production philosophy and consumption. Having social, regulatory, and public support for its contribution to sustainability and rural territories can be the counterpart that ensures its survival.

ents were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    At such high altitude the pastures are increasingly liable to abandonment (due to their inaccessibility, low productivity and poorly targeted policy support) leading to scrub encroachment (by juniper) and the consequent loss of biodiversity value. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. There are four innovations associated with this value chain: a) Setting up a NEW farm holding in the high mountains at a time when people are leaving the region not settling there plus good dialogue and cooperation with other farmers in the region; b) Introduction of suckler beef cows (Aberdeen Angus) there no tradition of grass-fed beef production in the region; c) Establishment of a rotational grazing system using electric fences, and; d) Direct online sales of beef and processed beef products (notably to customers in Sofia) supported by an effective marketing campaign on social media (Facebook and blog). The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low.

A young farmer's son decides to produce high quality, organic honey by partly innovating his production with barrel-aged honey and distilling mead. Most of the honey production is done in the mountain area. The beekeeper establishes commercial collaborations with local activities or located in neighbouring regions, like dairy and catering activities. Barrel-aged honey is an innovative product, just as mead production is not usual. The marketing strategy adopted is based on commercial cooperation that brings together several players from different production chains (dairies, restaurants, etc.).   The farmlands are used to produce peculiar honey (e.g., sunflower honey), while forest areas are used for traditional honey (Acacia honey). The beekeeper's knowledge is applied to improve quality production, invent new products and marketing initiatives.    Climate change is a significant challenge for honey production because of its adverse effects on plants' biological cycles and drought. Climate change also including the need to move hives in higher areas to find certain plant varieties. This practice and put a strain on the bees' ability to resist in colder mountain zones.

This is a very unusual, but potentially very profitable, value chain for this region that combines new products, new farm management practices / production processes and new marketing strategies.   The natural assets used are the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) of the region. Many of these are publically-owned and were historically used as common grasslands under the control of the local municipality. After Bulgaria joined the EU and CAP Pillar I support payments were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay

The Caciocavallo cheese holds the national label of 'Traditional Food Italian Product' and it can be considered an territorial identity of the area. The product valorise a cow breeding ('Podolica') tipical of Southern Italy and it is produced valorizing local traditions and cultural know-how. The connection with the land use system is strong, since the cheese can only be produced by 'Podolica' cows bred through the wild or semi-wild systems. The amount of product available for the market is limited. Thus, besides the local makets and on-farm selling, producers started to exploit alternative marketing strategies to reach larger consumer communities such as e-commerce and on-farm selling connected with hosting activities.   The area is characterised by a higlhy mixed land use system, where forests and natural grassland the dominant land use systems in the interplay with agricultural land. The 'Podolica' cow breed is traditional asset of the Southern Italian regions, characterized by lower milk production compared with intensive cow breed (e.g., Frisona, Pezzata Rossa), but very much suited for breeding through in wild and semi-wilde systems.    The Caciocavallo cheese is produced in a very remote mountain area with a market trait of rurality which is affected by ageing population and depopulation. The remoteness of the area make it difficult for the active part of the population to share formal and informal knowledges and experiences that can promote the valorisation of local natural (busheses, woods, and natur

The preparation is carried out by hydroalcoholic distillation in stills. The emergence of non-alcoholic liquors, the opening of tourist and cultural visits to the distilleries, and the creation of thematic museums have allowed a certain revitalization of the sector and maintenance of the activity and territorial prestige linked to the production of spirits in Rute.   This distillate of high graduation (45 -55 ) comes from the artisan distilleries located in Rute and Baena municipality (province of Córdoba) since the 17th century. It is characterized by its elaboration flavored by green anise seed, or Pimpinella Anisum from the fields of the province of Malaga.    The aniseed-flavoured spirits sector is less important than in the past, also due to the higher demand for lower alcohol degree beverages, the seventies' industrial crisis, and rigorous tax rates. All of that has contributed to the disappearance of many companies and currently there are only five. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current.

The main original innovation was the deepen understand of the agronomical traits of the main local variety Nerello Mascarese, and its adaptation to volcanic soils and mountain climate, thanks to the knowledge brought by the experienced wineries from outside the region. Later, the use of oak wood casks for Nerello fining, was optimzing the intrinsec quality of the red wines. In the last 15 years took place an increasing adoption of organic, biodynamic, natural, and quantic standards for production. An active consortium Vini Etna DOC and an institutional Enoteca Regionale, respectively for control of origin and typicity and for promotion of the appalletion wine, synergically support the marketing activities of the private enterprises.
