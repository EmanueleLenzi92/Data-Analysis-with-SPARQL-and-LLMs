Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative again carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is composed of small-scale farming where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk. They sell cheese directly on the farm. The processing involves milk, but there's no mention of wool at all. 

I know that sheep are used for both meat and dairy, as well as wool. But in this case, the focus seems to be solely on the milk being processed into cheese. There's nothing about shearing the sheep for their fleece or any steps related to wool production.

The innovation type is unspecified, but it's related to the whole VC. The land use system is grassland, which makes sense for grazing sheep, but again, that doesn't necessarily mean they're producing wool. 

Local assets include natural and cultural aspects, which could relate to farming practices but not specifically to wool production.

So, putting this together, the value chain here is involved in sheep milk production and cheese making, not wool. Therefore, it's not using sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is NMK, with a specific card ID. It says that private owners are breeding sheep and selling lambs collectively. Hmm, so they're raising sheep but focusing on selling lambs. Lambs are young sheep, typically raised for meat rather than wool. So if they're selling lambs, it's more likely about meat production.

Next, the value chain is called Mountain Meleshevija and is classified as both traditional and innovative. The innovation part mentions new technology in processing lamb meat and distribution channels for foreign markets. Again, this points towards meat processing rather than wool production because the focus is on improving how they handle the meat and reaching more markets.

The land use systems are grassland and natural land, which makes sense for sheep grazing. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects, but nothing here suggests wool as a product. The narrative doesn't mention shearing or processing wool at all; it's all about lamb meat.

So putting this together, the value chain is involved in breeding and selling lambs for meat, not using sheep to produce wool. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep for producing wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Portugal Estrelda, with a specific card ID. It then states that wool comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela sheep, an autochthonous breed. So right away, it's clear that sheep are involved in producing wool here.

Next, it mentions that the sheep are shorn in spring and only the best quality wool is used for textiles. That definitely ties sheep to wool production. Additionally, it notes that wool products are also made using other breeds like Churra Mondegueira and Portuguese Merino. This reinforces that sheep are a key part of their wool production.

The narrative doesn't mention any other uses or products beyond wool, so there's no indication they're involved in anything else besides producing wool from sheep. Therefore, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in using sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3016 uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that cattle graze in cultivated pastures and open pastures around farms during the grazing season from May to October. It also notes that in winter, animals are kept indoors but doesn't specify which animals beyond mentioning "ani" which seems like a typo or abbreviation. The type of innovation is unspecified, and the local assets include natural and social aspects.

Nowhere does it mention sheep specifically. The focus is on cattle grazing, so unless there's an implicit assumption that all grazing animals in such contexts are sheep, but I shouldn't assume that. Since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that sheep are involved or used for wool, I can't conclude that they're part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no mention of sheep being used for wool production, the correct response is an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in the narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with ID VC 04 SK in Slovakia. The key activities listed are sheep breeding, wool selling, wool processing, and marketing. That already suggests that sheep are involved in producing wool since sheep breeding is mentioned as one of the main activities.

Looking further, the key actors include sheep breeders, processors, and consumers. Sheep breeders obviously raise sheep for their products, which in this case includes wool. The fact that they're selling wool indicates that it's part of their business model.

The narrative also mentions that sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia, and wool is a by-product of sheep breeding. This directly ties sheep to wool production. It goes on to say that wool processing is considered an innovation because previously, wool wasn't being processed and was instead treated as waste. Now, there are workshops for manual processing, which again points to the use of sheep wool.

Additionally, the narrative discusses challenges like low prices from imported wool affecting sales, but despite this, they're still processing and selling wool. There's also mention of national policies assisting farmers with wool sales and industrial processing, further indicating that wool production is a significant part of their value chain.

So putting it all together, the activities, actors, and context all revolve around sheep being bred for their wool, which is then processed and sold. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this narrative does indeed use sheep to produce wool.

Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric. Different Burel Products such as wall panels, carpets, curtains, cushion covers, poufs and benches, suitcases, backpacks, footwear and clothing items are produced and then sold locally, nationally and internationally.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrela and the VC ID is 17 PT2. It then talks about wool used in producing Burel fabric, specifically from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela, Churra Mondegueira, and Portuguese Merino sheep breeds. So right away, it's clear that sheep are involved because they're explicitly mentioned as the source of wool.

Next, the narrative explains the process: shearing the sheep, using only the best quality wool for textiles, spinning into yarn, weaving, and then treating the fabric with machines to make Burel. This is a detailed production chain focused on transforming sheep's wool into finished products like fabrics and various goods such as clothing and home items.

The narrative also mentions that these products are sold locally, nationally, and internationally, which further supports that this is an active value chain centered around wool from sheep. Additionally, the reference mountain chain is Cordilheira Central (RR08), located in Manteigas, Portugal, which adds context about where this value chain operates but doesn't affect whether sheep are used.

So putting it all together, the narrative explicitly mentions sheep breeds and their wool being used in production. Therefore, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the main actor is a cooperative called Weizer Schafbauern - Die Schaferei, which owns the brand Määh. The term "Schaf" in German means sheep, so they're definitely involved with sheep. It says the lamb is their flagship product, which suggests they raise sheep for meat.

They collaborate with ALMO farmers and free-range pig farmers, and they bought an old slaughterhouse that was rebuilt to meet organic certification standards. This indicates they process their own animals, likely for meat production.

The narrative also mentions that sheep farming has a tradition in the region since the Middle Ages, especially where cattle can't graze. They use mountain pastures to counteract forestation and increase biodiversity. However, there's no specific mention of wool production here; it's more about raising sheep for meat and managing the land.

The cooperative aims to secure income through joint marketing and resource sharing, which includes selling products under the brand Määh. The innovation mentioned is in marketing strategies and new product development, but again, nothing points towards wool being a part of their products.

So, while they do use sheep, it seems focused on meat production rather than wool. There's no indication that they're processing sheep for wool or textiles. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2777 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions extensive sheep farming and pastoralism in the Drôme valley. It talks about local slaughtering and direct sales, but it doesn't specify whether this is for meat or wool. The focus seems more on the economic aspects like creating local added value and employment, as well as dealing with challenges such as predation by wolves and droughts.

There's a mention of organic sheep meat through direct sales, which points towards meat production rather than wool. Additionally, the narrative discusses ecosystem services like silvopastoralism but doesn't link that to wool production. The value chain is described as traditional and dependent on EU financial support, dealing with issues like biodiversity impact and changing consumer demands.

Since the text specifically refers to sheep farming for meat and local sales without mentioning wool production, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to provide a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the VC has an ID of 10 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in pastures during the summer months from May to October. In winter, they're fed with organic roughage and supplements.

The farm is part of Uvdalsbonden, which is a producer's organization aiming to improve visibility and reach more customers. They're certified organic by Debio. Their products include milk, organic veal meat, and free-range pork. The website has an e-commerce platform.

Further down, it mentions that the local brand/producer association Uvdalsbonden consists of five farms committed to animal well-being, traditional food, and land management. They produce free-range lamb and goat meat, pork, cow meat, and even llama meat. They also offer accommodation and fishing tourism packages.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used for wool production here. The narrative mentions that they produce free-range lamb and goat meat. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the sheep are raised for their wool. It focuses more on meat production and organic certification related to milk and meat products.

Since there's no mention of wool being produced or processed in any way, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Romania is the reference member state, with a specific card ID. It talks about a processing unit located near Sibiu, and it's classified as Innovative, specifically Exogenous innovation. 

Then there's this part: "Wool is purchased from sheep farmers in the surrounding area..." That clearly indicates that sheep are involved because they're providing wool. The value chain buys wool from these farmers.

Further down, it mentions a start-up called 'Naked Sheep' which buys wool and turns it into pellets for organic fertilizer. So, the process involves taking wool from sheep to make another product. 

The land use systems mentioned are Grassland and Natural land, which makes sense because sheep graze on grasslands. The local assets include natural resources, which aligns with sheep farming.

Putting this together, the value chain is definitely involved in using sheep for their wool. They purchase wool directly from sheep farmers, so it's part of their process.

The narrative mentions that "Milk lamb is seasonally produced, mostly in autumn, by approximately 300 dairy-ewe farmers." It also talks about two associations of farmers intervening for slaughtering the animals and something else, but it cuts off at "corres". 

Hmm, so they're talking about milk lambs. Milk lambs are usually young sheep raised for their meat or sometimes their milk. The mention of slaughter suggests that these lambs might be used for meat production rather than wool. There's no direct reference to wool being produced or sheared from the sheep in this narrative.

Additionally, the value chain is associated with France INRAE and has a reference card ID VC 11 FR. While I don't have specific knowledge about all value chains, the focus here seems to be on milk lamb production and slaughter, which points more towards meat rather than wool.

So, putting it together, since there's no mention of wool production or sheep being used for their fleece, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2981 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with the reference member state being Scotland Hutton and the Card ID VC 22 UK. It mentions Ben Lomond as the most southerly 'Munro' and an accessible entry point for 'Munro Bagging.' Then it shifts to another location in Gwynedd, which is part of Wales, specifically within the Snowdonia National Park. The challenges mentioned are about safeguarding the natural environment due to access pressures.

Now, I'm looking for any mention related to sheep or wool production. The narrative discusses cultural challenges like 'Munro Bagging' and environmental issues but doesn't talk about sheep farming, wool production, or any related activities. It focuses more on tourism and environmental management rather than agricultural practices involving sheep.

Since there's no information indicating that the value chain involves sheep for wool, I should conclude that it isn't involved in such activities.

The narrative does not mention anything about sheep or wool production; it focuses on cultural and environmental aspects related to Ben Lomond and Snowdonia National Park. Therefore, the mountain value chain is not involved in using sheep to produce wool.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 CH2. The VC is composed of about 60 sheep farmers, members of the association and consumers. The association collects the wool and then processes and adds value to it. The wo

More than two thirds of the wool produced in Switzerland is destroyed, due to a lack of recognition, time and remuneration, but also because a whole know-how has been lost. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation comes from the wilingness to valorise wool and to give an economic life to wool which is often perceived as a waste product. The organisation in the form of an association, operating in a horizontal manner with a will to raise awareness and inform through its educational pole, represents a form of innovation. The innovation is related to New products and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and social.   A part of the VC is not present in the MLR, since the wool is washed on the germand part of Switzerland. There are also two additional sub-sVC's, depending on the quality of the wool: insulation wool and the spinning mill at Chantemerle in France for garments, by the Longo Maï cooperative.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the VC (Value Chain) has around 60 sheep farmers as members. That's a strong indicator because sheep farming typically involves raising sheep for their products, which includes wool. The association collects the wool and processes it further, adding value. This processing step is crucial because it directly ties into wool production.

Next, the narrative points out that more than two-thirds of the wool produced in Switzerland is destroyed due to various reasons like lack of recognition and lost know-how. This emphasizes that the VC is actively dealing with wool, trying to find ways to utilize it instead of letting it go to waste. Their approach involves valorizing wool and giving it an economic life, which means they're processing it into products rather than discarding it.

The innovation aspect mentioned is about creating new products from wool and implementing a new governance system through their association. They have sub-VCs for different qualities of wool: insulation wool and garments made by the Longo Maï cooperative in France. These subdivisions suggest that they are indeed processing wool into various end products, which further confirms their involvement in wool production.

Additionally, the land use systems involved are grasslands, which is typical for sheep farming as sheep graze on such areas. The local assets include natural and social aspects, which align with sustainable practices often seen in value chains focused on natural resources like wool.

Putting it all together, the narrative clearly describes a value chain that starts with sheep farmers collecting wool, processing it, and creating products from it. They're addressing the issue of wasted wool by finding innovative ways to utilize it, both in terms of product development and governance. Therefore, this mountain value chain is indeed involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3052 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain (VC) where Spain ADEGUA is the reference member state. The specific card ID is VC13 ES. It mentions organic production of olive oil in mountain areas. It says this involves a small group of producers targeting a niche market, which can help them survive if they can establish a specific mark. There's also mention of scaling up by connecting organic production with innovative and integrated regenerative practices that conserve mountain ecosystems and landscapes.

Now, I'm looking for any indication related to sheep or wool production. The narrative focuses on olive oil, not wool. Olive oil is produced from olives, which are plants, whereas wool comes from sheep, which are animals. There's no mention of sheep, shearing, textiles, or anything related to wool in the text.

Therefore, since the value chain here is about olive oil production and there's no connection to sheep or wool, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool production.

The narrative discusses organic olive oil production, not sheep or wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2971 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and mentions a PGI mark for Welsh Lamb since 2003, which is considered the best lamb worldwide. It emphasizes traditional non-intensive rearing processes. 

It lists natural assets like land maintenance, social assets with good relationships, and cultural aspects relying on traditional knowledge. Threats include costs from Brexit and COVID, climate change affecting land use and rainfall, and the closure of a local abattoir in 2021, which forced farmers to travel further.

The value chain is classified as Traditional, using processes that have been around for many years. It mentions land use systems like grassland and natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural elements. The production area is across Wales, with some mention of Scotland and Northern England regions.

Now, the key point here is whether they're producing wool or just lamb. The narrative focuses on Welsh Lamb as a product, designated with a PGI mark, which typically refers to meat products rather than wool. There's no mention of sheep being used for their wool; instead, it's all about rearing and selling lamb.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain in question is involved in producing lamb, not wool. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID since they're not using sheep for wool production.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to provide a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the VC (Value Chain) is based on a family farm producing herbs and flowers, both fresh and dry. They also own a dehumidifier for drying their products and have certifications like Demeter for organic and bio-dynamic farming. Their sales channels include direct sales, online, and through a cooperative to grocery stores and the HORECA market.

Looking further, it talks about the reference mountain chain being the Scandinavian Mountains - Scandes, specifically in Lom, which is near Jotunheim National Park. The area's economy traditionally relies on farming, with other VCs including cured meat, raw meat, fish, honey, stone-milled flour, flatbread, and berries. Tourism is also growing.

Now, I need to check if sheep are involved in wool production here. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or wool. It focuses on herbs, flowers, and other products like meat, fish, honey, etc., but no indication of sheep for wool. So, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence that this value chain uses sheep to produce wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2909 involves using sheep for wool production. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) where the main activity is sheep breeding. It mentions that private owners breed sheep and sell lambs collectively. The region, Maleshevija, is known for lamb meat as a quality product exported to several countries. They also note that sheep farming is a key economic activity there.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention wool production or the use of sheep for their wool. It focuses on lamb meat, exports, and challenges like decreasing sheep numbers and labor shortages. There's no reference to shearing sheep for wool, processing wool, or any products related to wool.

So, based on the given content, the mountain value chain is involved in sheep breeding primarily for meat production, not wool. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID since it doesn't involve wool production.

The cattle grazes in open pastures during the summer time, as the rest of the year they are covered by snow. For this reason, another important element is the cutivation and harvest of winter fodder. It is known that free range also delivers ecosystem services such as seed dissemination or fertilization and fire risk reduction besides the ecological benefits of making use of local and sustainable resources and maintenance of pastures (great carbon sequestration rates in soils).

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the VC ID is 05 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in open pastures during summer, and during winter, they're covered by snow. So, they have to cutivat... I think it's "cultivate" but maybe a typo. They mention cultivating and harvesting winter fodder.

It also says that these farms combine various animals for meat and dairy production, including cows, goats, and sheeps. Wait, so they do have sheep on the farm. But does that mean they're using them for wool? The narrative doesn't explicitly say they produce wool. It focuses more on meat and dairy production.

The text goes on to talk about in-farm tourism and the mountain landscape with pastures, forests, streams, etc., but there's no mention of wool processing or textile production. They do discuss ecosystem services like seed dissemination and fertilization, as well as carbon sequestration, which are environmental benefits, but again, nothing about wool.

So, while sheep are part of the farms for meat and dairy, there's no indication that they're involved in producing wool. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID since the value chain isn't confirmed to be using sheep for wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about Ben Lomond, a mountain in Scotland, being part of a value chain (VC). It mentions that Ben Lomond is an accessible entry point for "Munro Bagging," which refers to climbing mountains. The focus here seems to be on tourism, outdoor activities like hillwalking and climbing, and the associated economic benefits.

The narrative discusses various aspects such as ecological value (designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest with specific wildlife), societal value because it's accessible from population centers, cultural significance as an iconic landscape, and economic contributions through tourism. It also mentions the financial impact, like average daily spend by visitors and the valuation of the hillwalking sector.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or wool production. The discussion revolves around outdoor activities, environmental protection, and economic aspects related to tourism and recreation. There's no indication that the value chain involves agriculture, specifically sheep farming for wool.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't reference sheep or wool production, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for that purpose.

The narrative mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 48 IT. It talks about 'Latte del Parco' farm being linked to the natural and cultural context of the mountains, specifically mentioning their natural resources like mountain pasture.

Hmm, so it says they're connected to the mountains for natural resources, particularly mountain pasturage. Mountain pastures are often used for grazing sheep. But does that mean they produce wool? Well, sheep are commonly raised in mountainous areas for their wool. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention wool production. It just talks about the farm's connection to the natural and cultural context through pasturage.

I'm trying to see if there's any direct indication of wool being produced. The terms used are 'natural resources' and 'mountain pasture,' which could imply sheep grazing but not necessarily wool processing or use. Without explicit mention of wool production, I can't be certain that the value chain is involved in using sheep for wool.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's safer to assume that the mountain value chain isn't definitively involved in producing wool from sheep.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 UK. Welsh Lamb is designated with a PGI mark (since 2003), and it is often considered as the best lamb in the worls. It is reared uing traditional non-intensive processes on (upland) land which is not viable to be used for crop growing or similar activities. Within the Powys area lamb farmers, butchers, abbatoir workers and local shops are involved in the VC. Also local auction houses are involved. The lamb is sold in butchers, supermarkets and in meat boxes online. Welsh lamb, beef and pork industry combined has a value of over £1 billion a year to the Welsh economy and it consumes only 5% of the red meat it produces so exports are very important. Lamb and beef exports account for one third of all sales and are worth more than £224 million (2013). The industry supports over 50,000 jobs. International sales of PGI marked Welsh lamb grew to £154.7 million in 2013.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is East Wales (NUTS 2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Powys. Powys is a large and mostly rural region of Wales, which contains parts of the River Severn, Wye and Usk valleys and the Brecon Beacons in the south, a very popular hiking area. The area contains no large urban areas, although the area is relatively accessible to major population centres in other parts of Wales and England.   The size of the area (km2) is 5195.320923.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the VC ID is VC 12 UK. It talks about Welsh Lamb being designated with a PGI mark since 2003, which I know stands for Protected Geographical Indication. This means it's recognized for its specific origin and quality.

It says Welsh Lamb is often considered the best in the world and is reared using traditional non-intensive processes on upland land that's not suitable for crops. So they're talking about sheep farming here, specifically lamb production. The value chain involves farmers, butchers, abattoir workers, local shops, and auction houses. They sell the lamb in various places like butchers, supermarkets, and online meat boxes.

The economic impact is mentioned too—over £1 billion a year to the Welsh economy, with exports being significant. It also notes that the industry supports over 50,000 jobs. The reference mountain chain is East Wales (NUTS 2), and the landscape includes areas like Powys, which has rivers and the Brecon Beacons, popular for hiking.

Now, the key point is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. The narrative focuses on lamb, which refers to the meat of young sheep. While sheep are involved, the emphasis here is on their meat, not their wool. There's no mention of wool processing or textile production in the description. It talks about the lamb industry, exports, and economic contributions from lamb, beef, and pork.

So, even though sheep are part of the value chain, it's for meat, not wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

The narrative mentions that the VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion' which promotes local food specialties and sets quality standards. It specifically talks about sheep playing a crucial role in mountain farming, maintaining pastures, and cultural landscapes important for tourism. 

It also notes that sheep farming has a centuries-long tradition but shifted to meat production in the 1950s due to marketing opportunities. The focus is on marketing as a local specialty, including traditional breeds. However, there's no explicit mention of wool production.

So, while sheep are central to their farming and economy, the narrative doesn't specify that they're using sheep for wool. It emphasizes meat production and marketing as food specialties. Therefore, I don't have enough evidence to conclude that wool is part of this value chain.

The mountain value chain in the narrative focuses on sheep for meat production and cultural aspects but does not mention wool production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is the Czech Republic and the Value Chain (VC) spans all important activities from breeding, husbandry, processing food, and products to sheep products, specifically meat and wool. That already indicates that sheep are involved in producing both meat and wool.

Further down, it talks about farms creating new marketing channels for their products, which includes sheep products. It also mentions that the region is attractive for tourists who are interested in sheep farms and their products. Some farms even offer agro-tourism services, which likely include showcasing how they produce wool from sheep.

The narrative then discusses challenges faced by the VC. One of these is reliance on agricultural subsidies, another is climate change affecting water availability and grass for feeding sheep, and a third is the presence of predators like wolves that can damage sheep farms. These points reinforce that sheep are central to the value chain's activities because they're affected by environmental factors and economic challenges tied directly to sheep husbandry.

Additionally, it mentions that the VC is firmly embedded in the region and relies on local resources, with sheep farms providing ecosystem services. This suggests a comprehensive integration of sheep into their production processes, including wool as a key product.

Putting this all together, the narrative explicitly states that the VC deals with sheep products, specifically mentioning wool alongside meat. Therefore, it's clear that the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a value chain centered around Scotland Hutton with reference ID VC 21 UK. It describes the North-West Highland landscape and mentions wildlife tourism as a key component. The businesses involved are wildlife tour operators, small-scale accommodations, hospitality services, etc., all based in remote rural areas.

Looking at the details, it lists various flora and fauna species: red deer, ptarmigan, mountain hare, golden eagle, peregrine, mosses, lichens, liverworts, alpine bearberry, juniper, crowberry, cowberry, mountain sedges. There's a focus on environmental and cultural knowledge by locals and land managers that enhances tourism through information and interpretation.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. The emphasis is on wildlife, landscape, and tourism services related to nature and outdoor activities. While there are mentions of other animals like red deer and mountain hares, these aren't domesticated for wool. Sheep specifically would be needed for wool production, but that's not indicated here.

Therefore, the value chain doesn't seem involved in using sheep for wool.

The narrative does not mention sheep or wool production; it focuses on wildlife tourism and related services.

The narrative mentions that extensive sheep farming and pastoralism are characteristic of the Drôme valley mountain and mid-mountain areas. It also talks about local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to consumers or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron'. 

Hmm, so they're talking about sheep farming but focusing on local slaughter and sales. The term "sheep farming" can include both meat production and wool production, but in this context, it's more about the slaughtering for meat since they mention direct sales as agneau, which is lamb. There's no specific mention of wool or textiles.

Additionally, the value chain is described as traditional with local valorization through slaughterhouses and direct sales. The innovations mentioned are related to local economic organization and silvopastoralism, which is an integrated land use system combining forestry and grazing. 

Since there's no explicit reference to wool production, just sheep farming for meat, I think the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a narrative about a mountain value chain, and I need to determine if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I have to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 05 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in open pastures during summer and being covered by snow the rest of the year. That's interesting because it mentions cattle, not sheep.

Next, there are some numbers: the regional share of total BPs/year is 14.53%, number of agricultural holdings is 4271, nearest settlement with over 100,000 population is 121 km away. It also notes that protected areas are present in the region.

Then it goes into sector shares: primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors' employment percentages for both province and region. Primary sector is around 3-4%, secondary about 20%, and tertiary over 70%. These numbers suggest a more service-oriented economy but not directly related to sheep or wool production.

The narrative continues by highlighting that the value chain has a big cultural component and plays a role in conserving mountain pastures. It mentions a new product linked to tourism assets, marketing strategies involving regional brands and e-commerce. So far, nothing about sheep or wool.

It then talks about the challenges of managing mountain pastures due to climate, requiring specific techniques and commitment. It mentions practices, knowledge, farm architecture, landscapes, and products as part of cultural heritage. Still no mention of sheep or wool here.

Finally, it lists three competing factors: 1) Competing meat industry and market access; 2) Need to add value due to lower production capacity. Again, nothing about sheep or wool in these points.

Putting this all together, the narrative discusses a mountain value chain focused on cattle grazing, conservation of pastures, cultural heritage, tourism, and economic sectors but doesn't mention sheep at all. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain, let alone producing wool. The emphasis is more on meat production and market competition rather than wool.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Nowhere in this description do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. The products listed are meat from veal and heifer, which are cattle, not sheep. There's also a reference to corn flour, but nothing related to sheep or their byproducts like wool.

Therefore, based on the given content, the mountain value chain in narrative 2882 does not involve using sheep for wool production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative again carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) includes mainly farmers who produce something, along with local retailers and consumers. It says the product is processed directly on the farm by the farmers themselves. The VC is classified as Traditional, and it's present in the Swiss Alps. 

Now, I'm trying to see if sheep are involved in wool production here. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep or wool at all. It talks about farmers producing a product that's processed on the farm, but without specific details about what that product is. It could be dairy products, meat, or something else entirely.

Since there's no direct reference to sheep or wool, I can't assume they're part of this value chain. The information given doesn't provide enough evidence to conclude that sheep are used for wool production here.
</think>

The narrative does not mention sheep or wool production, so it's unclear if the VC involves using sheep for wool.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland and it's a traditional value chain. It talks about conventional agriculture and regional labels, which suggests they're involved in some form of farming or agricultural products. The land use systems include cropland, but there's no specific mention of sheep or wool anywhere in the text.

The challenges faced are described as "Predicted," but that doesn't give me any clues about their activities. The type of innovation is unspecified, so I can't infer anything from that either. The local assets mentioned are natural, which might relate to resources like water or land, but again, nothing about sheep or wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2975 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The reference card ID is VC 16 UK. Then it mentions that Harris Tweed is produced solely on the LAU1 of Western Isles, also known as Na h-Eileanan Siar in Gaelic. Harris Tweed is described as a spun wool cloth used to make specialized clothing and shoes, and it's noted that it legally can't be made elsewhere.

Further down, it says similar uses of wool are undertaken or processed throughout the member state, including tartan production, which is another wool product. Tartan is used for various items like kilts and is produced across the Highlands and Islands. Additionally, wool from Shetland (LAU1) has a PDO, which I think stands for Protected Designation of Origin.

So putting this together, the narrative clearly discusses the production of wool products like Harris Tweed and tartan. Since both are made from wool, it's evident that sheep are involved in the process because sheep are the primary source of wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative doesn't talk about farming, shearing sheep, or processing wool at all. It's focused entirely on fishing, both salmon and trout, in various locations. There's no indication that the value chain involves livestock beyond what's needed for fishing, which would be more about the environment and tourism rather than agriculture.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2971 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with the reference member state being Scotland Hutton and the Card ID VC 12 UK. It mentions "Welsh Lamb" having a PGI mark since 2003, which is noted as the best lamb in the world. The lambs are reared using traditional non-intensive processes in lowland areas of Scotland like Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders, some in the Highlands and Islands, and Northern England regions such as Eden and County Durham.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep being used to produce wool. The narrative focuses on lamb production, specifically Welsh Lamb, which is a meat product. There's no indication that the sheep are being sheared for their wool. Instead, it emphasizes the quality of the lamb and the rearing methods in different regions.

I should consider whether "lamb" refers only to the meat or if it includes wool. Typically, when discussing lamb in agricultural contexts, especially with a PGI mark, it's about the meat product. Wool production would likely mention shearing or textiles related to sheep.

Since there's no explicit mention of wool production, just lamb as a meat product, I can conclude that this value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the VC is composed of small-scale farming where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk to sell cheese directly on the farm.

I should also consider if there's any indirect reference to sheep being used for wool. The narrative doesn't mention shearing or textile production at all. It emphasizes the transformation of milk into cheese as an artisanal process, which is a key part of their value chain. 

Since the primary activities involve sheep's milk and dairy products, and there's no indication that the sheep are being sheared for wool, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID is 3131, so that's important in case I do find a match.

Cheese production uses traditional knowledge from the 17th century with PDO labeling.

Hmm, so far, I'm noticing that it's focused on dairy products—milk and cheese. There's mention of challenges like climate change affecting pasture and fodder but still centered around cattle. The narrative also discusses innovations like the 'girolle' product and issues with counterfeit products.

Wait a minute, where do sheep come into play? I don't see any references to sheep or wool in this text. It's all about dairy cows and cheese production. Even when talking about pasture maintenance, it's about extensive grazing for cattle, not sheep.

So, putting it together: The value chain here is about milk and cheese from cows, not sheep and their wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 FR1. Picodon AOP is a goat-milk cheese from the Drome, very representative of middle mountain agriculture.The quality label AOP provides strict requirements in terms of production practices (type of goat, refinements, cultural practices, pasture, animal feeding..) and promotion and marketing in and out of the territory. The VC is well established and structured by farmers unions (Syndicat Caprin, Syndicat AOP Picodon.) and dairy cooperatives. It can be either marketed in long distribution channel or local market. In fact, one can find a great diversity of producing practices: organic and farmer Picodon or convention dairy picodon production. In 2017 the marketed production was 532 tons, or nearly 9,000,000 picodons, of which nearly 1,600,000 were produced by the appellation's farm producers and sold at the region's markets. Pastoralism practices are very well developped in the territority, namely by farme Picodon producers, but suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, pasture's impact on biodiversity. However, the opportunities is to show that pastoralism can provide ecosystemic services (sylvopastoralims, goat pasture prevent from fire starts).

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France CCVD, and the Value Chain (VC) has a specific card ID. It talks about Picodon AOP, which is described as a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region. That's interesting because it specifies goats, not sheep.

The quality label AOP has strict requirements regarding production practices, including the type of goat, feeding, and pastures. The VC is structured by farmers' unions and cooperatives, focusing on dairy production. They mention both organic and conventional production methods but still within the context of goat milk cheese.

Looking further, the narrative discusses pastoralism practices, which are well-developed in the region. However, it specifically refers to farm Picodon producers, again tying back to goats. There's also mention of challenges like wolf predation and droughts affecting pasturelands, but these are still within the context of goat herding.

I don't see any references to sheep or wool production anywhere in the narrative. The focus is entirely on goat milk cheese, its production methods, marketing channels, and the associated pastoral practices. There's no mention of sheep being used for their wool, which would be necessary for producing textiles or clothing.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain described here isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. It's centered around goat milk cheese production, so the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Italy with UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 46 IT. It then talks about a large family of 2,300 mountain farmers and 470 employees. Their mission is to uphold the South Tyrolean dairy industry and produce high-quality products. They also mention that their assets include "Natural."

Hmm, so the key points here are that it's a dairy industry focused on producing high-quality products. The terms used are "dairy" and "high-quality products," which makes me think of milk, cheese, yogurt, etc., rather than wool.

Sheep can be involved in both dairy and wool production, but in this case, the narrative specifically mentions the dairy industry. There's no mention of wool or sheep for that purpose. The focus seems to be on maintaining and supporting the dairy sector with their cooperative structure.

I don't see any indication that they're using sheep for wool. It's more about dairy products. So, based on this information, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 FR1. Extensive sheep farming and pastoralism are characteristic of Drôme valley mountain and mid-mountain areas. Local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to the consumer or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron' allows to produce value on the territory. However, this value chain is very dependent on financial support from the EU. The VC suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, changes in consumer demand, impact on biodiversity. There are many local and regional stakeholder organizations (ADEM/PNR/FDO..) requesting support to address these issues through ecological, economic and social impact assessment of VC and support to change practices.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Drome Valley. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Drome departement. Drôme is a very diversified departement in terms of geological, natural and agricultural resources.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that extensive sheep farming and pastoralism are characteristic of the Drôme valley area. It also talks about local slaughtering and direct sales, either to consumers or under the label 'Agneau de sisteron'. 

Now, I need to determine if this value chain is involved in producing wool. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention wool production. Instead, it focuses on sheep farming for meat (since they're talking about slaughter and selling as 'Agneau', which refers to lamb). There's no indication of wool processing or textile manufacturing.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned include issues like predation, droughts, and consumer demand changes, but these are related more to the sustainability and economics of sheep farming rather than wool production specifics. The stakeholders involved are working on ecological and economic assessments, which again don't point towards wool as a product.

So, putting it all together, while sheep are definitely part of the value chain for meat, there's no evidence in the narrative that they're using sheep to produce wool. Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state SKANDINAVIAN UCO and reference card ID VC 08 SCA. It mentions Pultost, which is a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without rennet. They use self-produced cultures of lactic bacteria for coagulation. After processing, the cheese is crumbled, fermented, and then salt and caraway seeds are added to stop fermentation. The cheese can be eaten fresh or matured up to a year, and the leftover cream is used for sour cream or butter.

Next, it talks about the reference mountain chain being the Scandinavian Mountains - Scandes, specifically the Lesja area. Lesja is described as a high mountainous region with a large lake, Lesjaskogsvatnet, which drains into two rivers. There are over 400 lakes in the municipality, many above the treeline, and they're habitats for Norwegian trout. Most of the area is above 900 meters altitude, with traditional summer farms along the treeline. These farms are important for extensive livestock systems during summer when animals graze on high pastures.

The narrative mentions that these farms are crucial for traditional livestock systems but doesn't specify what kind of animals they're referring to. It talks about grazing in high-altitude pastures, which is common for sheep and other livestock like cows or goats. However, the cheese mentioned earlier is made from cow's milk, so maybe cows are the primary focus here.

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention sheep specifically or the production of wool. The cheese is from cows, and while traditional summer farms might graze various animals, there's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain for wool production. The emphasis seems to be on dairy products and the local ecosystem rather than fiber production.

So, putting it all together, the mountain value chain here is involved in dairy production, particularly cheese and butter, using cow's milk. There's no mention of sheep or wool processing. Therefore, the answer should be an empty JSON since they're not using sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state called SKANDINAVIAN UCO and a specific card ID VC 04 SCA. It mentions that the meat comes mostly from the same region, and the company produces cured meat in a mountain farm using dry wind for processing. The products are sold locally and throughout Norway under the brand 'Oppdal- taste of mountains,' which emphasizes local origin.

Next, it describes the reference mountain chain as the Scandinavian Mountains (Scandes) and the specific landscape as Oppdal. Oppdal is mostly mountainous with areas above the tree line, featuring lakes, streams, rivers, and forests of birch trees. Above the treeline, there are heathers and alpine meadows used for grazing cattle during summer. It's noted that Oppdal has exceptional grazing land according to a Norwegian institute.

The narrative goes on with details about the area size, altitudes, population statistics, and climate, including average temperatures from -5°C in winter to 11°C in summer, with possible snow until May.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves using sheep for wool. The text mentions meat production, specifically cured meat, which suggests they're dealing with livestock but primarily for meat. It also talks about grazing land for cattle during summer. There's no mention of sheep or wool anywhere in the narrative. The focus seems to be on meat products and local branding rather than textiles or wool.

Therefore, since there's no indication that sheep are involved in producing wool, the value chain isn't engaged in wool production from sheep.

The mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep for wool production. It focuses on meat production, particularly cured meats, utilizing cattle grazing but without mention of sheep or wool.

It is unclear from desktop research how much cultural (local) knowledge is involved, with many partners in the rewilding effort coming from elsewhere in the UK or even internationally.    Rewilding is very contentious in Scotland (for example the Nature Agency does not use the term). It's proponents critique traditional approaches to upland land management as damaging to Nature, and increases in native (or reintroduced) species e.g. boar, golden eagles, beavers can create damage to livestock or pasture; whilst trees decrease grazing available to wild game (deer, grouse). Much rewilding is associated with public funding or public donations (NGOs) or wealthy philantrophists; and investments are often tied to predicted returns from carbon markets or wildlife tourism, which are relatively high-risk long term investments.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative ID 2968 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Scotland Hutton and a Card ID VC 08 UK. The key activities listed are tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna. The key actors include land owners like NGOs or wealthy philanthropists, consultants, and students/academics.

Looking further, the narrative mentions that there's some timber and lamb production. It also discusses increasing public goods through ecosystem services. There's a focus on rewilding, which is contentious in Scotland. They mention that rewilding involves reintroducing species like boar, golden eagles, beavers, etc., but it's unclear how much local cultural knowledge is involved.

Rewilding efforts are often funded by public money or donations from NGOs and philanthropists. The investments are tied to carbon markets or wildlife tourism, which are high-risk long-term ventures. The VC is classified as innovative, with both endogenous and exogenous innovation since rewilding isn't new but has gained prominence due to climate and biodiversity issues.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. From the narrative, I see that they mention lamb production, which refers to meat, not wool. There's no explicit mention of sheep being used for their wool. The activities are more about rewilding, habitat restoration, and timber. While sheep might be part of the ecosystem, the focus here is on meat production rather than wool.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that the value chain involves using sheep to produce wool. They're involved in lamb (meat) production and rewilding efforts, but not specifically in wool production.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing wool. The narrative focuses on activities such as tree planting, habitat restoration, and lamb (meat) production, with no mention of wool production.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Turkey and the VC ID is VC09 TR. It talks about feeding and milking activities done by small family farms, specifically involving sheep and goats. Some breeders make cheese using dried goat or sheep skin. The production method is described as very un—though I'm not sure if "un" is a typo here; maybe it's supposed to be "uneconomic" or something else.

Further down, the narrative mentions that cheese made from goat and sheep milk is included in other MRLs (which I think stands for Maximum Residue Limits) in countries like Serbia, Spain, Switzerland. It specifically highlights İzmir tulum cheese as a special kind made by placing into handmade dried goat or sheep skin.

Now, the key points here are about cheese production using sheep and goats' milk and their skins. The question is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. From the narrative, I don't see any mention of wool being produced. It's all about milking and making cheese from sheep and goat milk, as well as using their skin in the cheese-making process.

So, while sheep are involved in the value chain, it's specifically for milk and possibly their skin for cheese production, not for wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep.

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep for wool production; instead, it focuses on cheese made from sheep and goat milk.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain with ID 3118. My task is to determine if this value chain involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to output a JSON object containing the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland and the reference card ID is VC 21 CH1. It talks about a young whiskey brand distilled at a high altitude in Grisons. The reference mountain chain isn't specified, but it's noted as exogenous, meaning it's influenced by external factors.

The innovation here seems to be bringing whiskey production to Switzerland using very Swiss features for marketing. They mention new products and processes, which suggests they're introducing something unique. The land use systems involved are cropland, and the local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to check if sheep and wool production are part of this value chain. Looking through the narrative, there's no mention of sheep, wool, or any related terms. Instead, it's focused on whiskey production, which is a distilling process. The land use being cropland might relate to growing ingredients for whiskey, like grains, but not sheep.

Since there's no indication that sheep are used here, I can conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2724 uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that BioAlpin is a cooperative helping mountain farmers with their income and marketing. It talks about producing premium products like different sorts of cheese and investing in new products such as beer and grain, which are untypical for mountain regions. They have a partnership with M-Preis supermarket chain for product development.

Nowhere in the narrative does it specifically mention sheep or wool production. The challenges faced include climate change affecting vegetable/fruit farmers due to heat and irrigation issues, and pasture farms dealing with biodiversity and grazing logistics. However, these are about challenges, not specific products like wool.

Since there's no direct reference to sheep or wool, I can conclude that the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool production.

The narrative does not mention sheep or wool production.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to return the ID of the narrative in a JSON format; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions activities like tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna. The key actors are landowners (NGOs or wealthy philanthropists), consultants, students, etc. Locations include various areas in Scotland, Lake District, Yorkshire Moors, and others. There's also a mention of rewilding projects and peatland restoration for carbon credits.

Now, I'm looking for any indication that sheep are involved in producing wool. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep or wool production at all. It focuses more on conservation efforts, habitat restoration, and economic opportunities through these activities. There's no reference to livestock farming, shearing, or textile production.

Since there's no information about sheep being used for wool, I conclude that the value chain isn't involved in that activity. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Following the centuries-old practice of livestock transhumance (sheeps, goats and cows), in November the herds that have spent the summer in the highlands of the Natural Park of the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in Jaén and Castril in Granada, make their particular journey through the province of Jaén, towards the lowlands of Sierra Morena to spend the winter.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning Spain as the reference member state and talks about 8,000 head of cattle making a round trip every year for better pastures and climate. It refers to this practice as part of the Rural Heritage of Humanity. They're trying to maintain and renew it with various initiatives.

Then it specifically mentions following centuries-old practices of livestock transhumance, which includes sheeps, goats, and cows. So they do have sheep involved in their transhumance activities. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that these sheep are used for wool production. It talks about managing herds, environmental value, challenges like infrastructure issues, aging shepherds, and the classification of the VC as traditional and innovative.

I'm trying to see if there's any mention of wool or textile production. The text focuses more on the movement of livestock, their management, and the preservation of this practice rather than the products derived from the animals. So while sheep are part of the transhumance, it doesn't specify that they're being used for wool.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, I can't confirm that the value chain is involved in producing wool from sheep. The narrative doesn't mention wool production as part of their activities.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the lead product is ALMO, which stands for Almo Steirisches Almochsenfleisch. That sounds like a type of beef or meat product because "Almochsen" refers to oxen used in farming. The ALMO label is for quality ox products, so it's focused on meat rather than wool.

It talks about traditional pasture farming with high animal welfare standards, involving cooperation between farmers and other actors like veterinaries, butchers, retailers, tourism, and regional development agencies. Innovations include their own regional slaughterhouse that works with sheep farmers, free-range pig farmers, and local butchers. So they're involved in meat production from various animals.

The narrative mentions the landscape preservation for tourism and the tradition of pasture farming over centuries as part of regional identity. However, there's no mention of wool production or sheep being used for anything other than possibly providing meat through slaughterhouses.

They also discuss potential climate impacts on feed sources but again, this relates to meat production rather than wool. There's no indication that sheep are kept for their wool; instead, the focus is on meat and regional value creation through slaughterhouses.

So putting it all together, while sheep farmers are part of their network, the primary product seems to be meat, not wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this narrative isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 is focused on meat production, specifically ALMO as a quality ox product, and involves sheep farmers primarily for meat through slaughterhouses. There's no mention of wool production.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the VC includes a family farm producing, processing, and selling yogurt directly on the farm. They also sell products to local cheese dairies. The main challenges they face are related to climate change affecting their milk production—specifically, droughts leading to loss of fodder, death of spruce trees, and uncertainties about grassland production and animal health.

Looking for any mention of sheep or wool in the narrative: I don't see any references to sheep being used. The focus is on yogurt made from goat's milk. There's no indication that they're involved in wool production. The products are related to dairy—yogurt, cheese—and there's no mention of textiles or wool processing.

The value chain is described as traditional and innovative, with innovation tied to new products. Land use systems involve grassland, but again, nothing about sheep for wool. Local assets include natural and cultural aspects, which doesn't point towards wool production either.

So, after reviewing the narrative thoroughly, there's no evidence that this mountain value chain uses sheep to produce wool. They're focused on dairy products from goats, not sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrela and the VC ID is 02 PT2. It talks about sheep breeds like Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira feeding on pastures in a specific area. They mention that these sheep can have their diet supplemented with simple or compound food, especially during certain times like pregnancy and lactation.

Then it goes into detail about the milk being used to produce Serra da Estrela Cheese PDO. It specifies that only salt and thistle flower are added, and there's a minimum maturation time of 30 days. There are several cheese fabrics, shepherds, and a producers' cooperative involved in technical assistance and protecting the PDO.

The narrative also describes the mountain chain as Cordilheira Central (RR08) and mentions Manteigas with its stunning landscapes and glaciers. It talks about historical aspects but doesn't mention wool production at all.

So, focusing on whether sheep are used for wool: The text discusses sheep breeds and their milk being used for cheese. There's no mention of wool processing or products made from wool. Cheese is clearly the main product here, not wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep for wool production; it focuses on dairy and cheese production.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3130 involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is based in Switzerland and includes a family farm producing yogurt. They sell directly on the farm and also supply local cheese dairies. The products are labeled 'IP S'—though it's cut off, so I'm not entirely sure what that stands for, but it might be some sort of certification or label.

Next, there are some statistics about employment sectors in a province and region. Primary sector (which relates to raw material production like agriculture) has 59.19% employment in the province, while secondary (manufacturing) is 4.63%, and tertiary (services) is 71.57%. These numbers might indicate that the local economy relies heavily on services but also has a significant agricultural base.

The narrative then talks about the farm being diversified, producing milk from specific Swiss goat breeds: Graubünden and Appenzell goats. These goats are part of ProSpecieRara, a foundation focused on preserving heritage plants and animals. The farm processes the milk on-site and sells products labeled as coming from the Jura region.

Importantly, it mentions that grazing areas are used for these goats instead of cows, which is different from the typical Swiss mountain land use. This alternative grazing system is threatened by climate change, particularly summer droughts, which affect pasture lands and spruce trees in wooded pastures. The farm's diversity helps with innovation and resilience.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on goats and dairy products—yogurt and cheese. There's no indication that the VC involves shearing sheep for their wool or processing it into textiles or other wool products.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 3130 does not involve using sheep to produce wool.

Pirot white cheese in brine produced in Pirot/Old Mountain area can be made of sheep, cow and mixed milk. Sheep and mixed cheeses are with higher reputation amongst customers. Sheep and mixed cheese is made during the milking sheep season (April-October), when sheep are usually living in the mountains (bacija - summer place for sheep, usually also joint herds form several farmers). Sheep and cow milk is of high quality, due to very good quality animal grazing on natural pastures of high quality (big variety of plant species). Cheese is produced out of pasteurised milk, and after curdling milk, and producing fresh cheese, the cheese is pressed and put in brine to mature for 20-30 days.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID. It talks about Pirot white cheese in brine, which can be made from sheep, cow, or mixed milk. It says that sheep and mixed cheeses have higher reputation among customers. 

Then it goes into details about how the cheese is produced: during the milking season (April-October), when sheep are in the mountains at a summer place called bacija. It mentions that sheep and cows graze on natural pastures with high-quality plants, leading to good milk quality. The cheese-making process involves pasteurizing the milk, curdling it, pressing, and maturing in brine for 20-30 days.

The reference mountain chain is Eastern Serbia's Stara Planina (Old Mountain) and Rhodopy mountains. It describes the landscape as part of the Balkans with valleys around it.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of wool production. The narrative focuses on cheese made from sheep milk but doesn't talk about using sheep for their wool. Cheese is a dairy product, not related to wool which comes from shearing sheep. There's no indication that the value chain involves shearing sheep or processing wool in any way.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain here is involved with sheep for dairy products (cheese) but not for wool production.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 20 SCA. It talks about producers, teachers, students, and consumers involved in organic food production in Norway. The organic productions are certified by Debio, which I think is a Norwegian certification body for organics.

The value chain's reference mountain chain is the Scandinavian Mountains (Scandes), with the reference landscape being Aurland. This area includes fjords like Aurland Fiord and Nærøyfjorden, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The local administrative unit has an area of 1467.7 km², ranging from sea level up to some maximum altitude.

Importantly, it mentions that Aurland's coat of arms depicts a goat, representing these animals and the cheese made from their milk as part of the cultural identity. So, goats are significant here for dairy products like cheese.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative doesn't explicitly talk about sheep at all. It focuses on organic food production, involving various stakeholders, but specifically highlights goats and their milk for cheese. There's no indication that sheep are used for wool in this value chain.

It talks about selling sheep with an average weight of ten kilos at around 50 € each to feedlots in Granada and Murcia. The main resource is from the sale of sheep.

Hmm, so they're raising sheep for meat since they're sold to feedlots, which are typically involved in fattening animals for slaughter. There's no mention of wool production here. The narrative doesn't talk about shearing, textiles, or any processing related to wool. It focuses on the livestock farms and their economic activity based on selling live sheep.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of wool. But looking again, it's all about the sale of sheep for meat. There's no indication that the sheep are kept for their wool instead of or in addition to meat production. The value chain seems centered around raising and selling sheep for slaughter rather than producing wool products.

So, based on this information, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused on meat production.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 UK. Highland cattle are very symbolic of Scotland and a great cultural asset to Scotland. They are kept as both a cultural asset and due to their good genetics (i.e., they produce leaner meat and birth more calves than other breeds of cows). Their milk also has a high butterfat content so they are frequently kept as house cows.Highland cow are also used to help crop the grass to the right conditions to encourage wildflowers and butterflies. They are well suited to the cold Scottish climate as they are hardy and can survive also in mountainous terrain. In multiple Locahber villages highland cattle roam freely highlighting both their importance to those areas, but also the potential for conflicts.

Lochaber is a region in the west of Scotland which features spectacular scenery, including the highest mountain in the UK, Ben Nevis, coastal areas and valleys. The area is a major destination for tourism and outdoor recreation.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2973 involves using sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions Highland cattle being symbolic and a cultural asset. It discusses their genetics, milk quality, and how they're used to manage grasslands for wildflowers and butterflies. There's also mention of them being suited for the cold climate and roaming freely in areas like Lochaber.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any reference to sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on Highland cattle and their roles—cultural, genetic benefits, milk, and environmental management. Since there's no mention of sheep at all, it seems clear that the value chain isn't involved with sheep for wool.

Therefore, according to the instructions, I should return an empty JSON because the mountain value chain doesn't involve using sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 2955 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that 'Pastrama de Oaie' is produced from boneless mutton, which comes from sheepmeat. It's preserved and smoked with a special recipe. So, they're using sheep for their meat, not necessarily for wool. 

I should check if there's any mention of wool production. The text talks about processing sheepmeat but doesn't say anything about shearing sheep or producing wool products like yarn or clothing. Instead, it focuses on the processed meat product and the regulations around labeling and authorization for mountain products.

Since the value chain is involved in using sheep for their meat (mutton), not for wool, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON. The correct response would be an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative again carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria, and the VC ID is 06 AT. It talks about farms using their own or wild fruits and marketing products individually through various channels like on-farm shops, internet, local gastronomy, and regional shops. The land use systems are natural land and orchards, with local assets being natural and cultural.

It also says that many farms in Austria distil their fruits and those from wild nature, particularly in mountainous areas. They produce in line with high quality standards.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative doesn't talk about animals at all except for the fact that they use wild fruits. There's no indication of raising sheep, shearing them for wool, or processing wool into products. All the examples given are related to fruit production and marketing strategies.

So, based on this information, it seems like the value chain is focused on fruit and not on sheep or wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

It talks about donkeys being kept in natural environments, grazing on pastures or fed with hay and oat when necessary. They apply principles of organic production, focusing on natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Hmm, so the key points here are that they're talking about donkeys, not sheep. The animals mentioned are grazing in natural pastures, but it's specifically donkeys. There's no mention of sheep at all in this narrative. 

Sheep would typically be involved if the value chain is producing wool because sheep are commonly raised for their wool. Since the narrative doesn't mention sheep and instead focuses on donkeys, it seems like they're not part of a wool production process here.

Therefore, since there's no indication that sheep are used to produce wool in this mountain value chain, I should return an empty JSON object.

Sheep are capable of using grassland in areas that may not be used by other ruminants (cattle, goats). At the same time farms located in mountain region also utilize the symbolic value of the territory. The mountains are associted with 'purity' and 'nature' and this association is typically used in the promotion of the food products from the given VC.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2760 uses sheep for wool production. Let's read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is the Czech Republic and the VC ID is 05 CZ. It talks about farms involved in sheep breeding, husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. They often use organic farming methods. 

Next, it says that sheep husbandry has positive ecological effects because they manage grazing specifically. The value chain utilizes natural assets like grassland and high nature areas. Sheep can graze on land that other ruminants can't, which is beneficial.

The narrative also mentions that the farms are in mountain regions and use the symbolic value of mountains for promoting their products. They focus on sheep dairy products creating a niche market. Challenges include marketing to urban consumers and economic pressures relying on direct payments.

Now, looking for clues about wool production. The narrative discusses sheep breeding and husbandry but doesn't explicitly mention wool. Instead, it focuses on dairy products as the unique niche. So while they raise sheep, there's no indication that wool is a product of this value chain.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't specify wool production, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON.

The mountain value chain described does not explicitly mention the use of sheep for wool production; it focuses on dairy products.

It also mentions that since 2005, the Slowfood Foundation established a Presidium for Brimost cheese, which includes six cheese makers and two shopkeepers. The cheese is sold online, in local stores, at an annual market, and other regional markets. The value chain has significant influence in the SES because it maintains natural pastures and is key to the village's economy, attracting visitors.

The reference mountain chain is the Scandinavian Mountains - Scandes, with a landscape in Aurland that includes fjords like Aurland Fiord and Nærøyfjorden, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area is dominated by fjords and mountains.

Now, looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative focuses on cheese made from goat's milk. There's no indication that sheep are involved in this value chain at all. It talks about maintaining natural pastures but doesn't specify the animals used beyond goats for dairy. The economic focus is on cheese sales and tourism, not wool.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused on goat's milk cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Slovakia and the key activities include sheep breeding, meat processing in a slaughterhouse, marketing, and selling. The key actors are domestic breeders, processors, and marketers in Slovakia.

It talks about shepherds letting sheep graze on pasture land overnight and during winter but stopping because of dangers, causing tension with nature protection authorities. The challenges are current, and the VC is both traditional and innovative. The innovation lies in marketing strategies for a new domestic market.

The narrative also mentions that sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia and is present in all mountain NUTS3 regions there. It notes that land use systems involve grassland and local assets include natural and social aspects.

Now, looking at the key activities: sheep breeding is mentioned, but it's paired with meat processing. There's no specific mention of wool production or processing. The focus seems to be on meat rather than wool. Also, the innovation part talks about marketing strategies, not about any changes in how wool is produced or used.

So, based on this, I don't see evidence that the value chain involves using sheep for wool. They're breeding sheep and processing them for meat, but there's no indication of wool production being part of their activities.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the reference card ID is VC 02 FR. It talks about Brocciu, which is a whey cheese made from ewes' and goats' milk. So, they're using sheep (ewes) for their milk to make cheese.

Now, I'm wondering if this means they're involved in producing wool as well. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention anything about wool production. It focuses on the dairy aspect—cheese production and on-farm cheese making. There's no indication that the sheep are being sheared for their wool or that any part of the value chain involves processing wool.

So, even though they're using sheep, it's specifically for milk to make Brocciu cheese. Since there's no mention of wool production, I don't think this value chain is involved in producing wool from the sheep.

It mentions that Scotland is a significant producer of venison, both wild and farmed. Specifically, it states that they produce 3500 tonnes of wild venison and 70 tonnes of farmed venison. There are 97 deer farms in Scotland as of 2020.

The challenges discussed include relationships within the value chain, export market issues due to Brexit or COVID, the time it takes for farmed venison to return on investment (two years), overgrazing or overculling, and climate change impacts. The classification of the VC is both Traditional and Innovative, with exogenous innovation related to new products like charcuterie and new processes.

The land use systems mentioned are Grassland, Natural land, and other types relevant for farmed deer. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. It also notes that wild and farmed venison are common in areas like Badenoch and Strathspey, linking to a game hunting VC, and mentions farmed venison in Newry and Mourne.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on venison, both wild and farmed, with discussions about deer farms, venison production processes, and related challenges. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain, whether for meat, milk, or wool.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't mention sheep or wool at all, I can conclude that the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

They may become more difficult/ less important to keep if Scotland becomes less attractive to tourists, or more impacted by climate changes (i.e., then the climate may no longer suit the cattle). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The keeping of highland cows for meat/ genetics is traditional, but their role as a territorial/ cultural identity symbol is new and innovative. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Highland cattle are found across the RR9 and also in lowland areas, with the main stockists close to cities (Aberdeenshire, Central belt near Edinburgh). Breeders are found all over the world including in South America, USA, Australia and the rest of Europe.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2973 involves using sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions Highland cattle specifically. It discusses their role as a cultural asset, genetic advantages, and challenges related to market changes or climate impacts. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types. 

It also details land use systems like grassland, forestry, and natural land, along with local assets such as natural, social, and cultural aspects. Highland cattle are found in various regions, including RR9 and lowland areas, near cities like Aberdeenshire and Edinburgh. Breeders are mentioned from around the world, but again, it's all about Highland cows.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on Highland cattle for meat and genetics, as well as their cultural significance. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain. Therefore, since the question is whether the mountain value chain uses sheep to produce wool, and based solely on the given content, the answer should be an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if a mountain value chain mentioned in a narrative uses sheep for wool production. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative has an ID of 3102. Let me go through each part to see if there are any mentions related to sheep or wool.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Switzerland is the moving reference member state, with a specific card ID. It talks about traditional knowledge of herbs, cultural value, and some labels in place. So far, nothing about sheep or wool here.

Next, it notes that the reference mountain chain isn't specified. The climate challenge mentioned is less water availability, which affects the VC's operations. The type of challenge is both current and predicted, classifying this VC as Traditional. Innovation details are unspecified, but it's related to the whole VC. Land use systems involved include Forestry and Natural land, with local assets being Natural, social, and gardens.

Looking through all these points, I don't see any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative focuses more on herbs, climate issues, and traditional practices without indicating involvement in animal husbandry for textiles.

Therefore, since there's no indication that the value chain uses sheep to produce wool, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

The product profits from regional tradition, and the challenge is current, classifying the VC as traditional. Innovation details are unspecified, and land use systems involve cherries from the region but most production elsewhere. Local assets include cultural aspects.

Now, I need to check if sheep wool production is involved here. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep or wool anywhere. It talks about a factory profiting from cultural value, smaller-scale production, regional tradition, and local assets like culture. However, without any specific reference to sheep or wool, there's no indication that the VC uses sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2808 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Greece and the card ID is VC 03 GR. It talks about meat production affecting pastures in Anogeia and their families. The prospects of the product bring together pastures, cultural associations, local authorities, and many different microclimates like rainfall, temperature, flora, etc. Each mountainous area of Crete has its own sheep breeds, such as the Anogeia tribe and the Sfakia tribe.

Hmm, so it's clear that sheep are involved here because they mention specific breeds like Anogeia and Sfakia tribes. However, the narrative focuses on meat production affecting pastures. It doesn't explicitly say anything about wool production. The emphasis is more on how meat production impacts the area and the different sheep breeds due to microclimates.

I'm trying to see if there's any mention of wool or textiles. The text talks about bringing together pastures, cultural associations, and local authorities through the product prospects. But it doesn't specify whether that product is meat or wool. Since the narrative starts by mentioning meat production, I might infer that their main focus is on meat rather than wool.

So, even though sheep are part of the value chain, the specific use here seems to be for meat, not wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this narrative isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The main agricultural activity in the Pester plateau area is livestock husbandry. It specifically talks about lamb meat production, referring to "Sjenica lamb." The sheep farms are described as being solely focused on grazing at natural pastures.

The product mentioned is "Sjenica dry sheep meat" or "Sjenica stelja," which is made from the local Sjenica sheep breed. It highlights that this meat has a high reputation and that the grazing on natural pastures with medical herbs contributes to the quality of the meat. The process involves cold smoking for preservation, which happens due to the strong winters and winds in the area.

The narrative also discusses marketing strategies, e-commerce efforts, and potential for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status and exports. However, there's no mention of wool production or any use of sheep for their fleece. The focus is entirely on meat production, from grazing to processing and marketing.

So, based on this information, the mountain value chain in question is involved in producing lamb meat, not wool. Therefore, they are not using sheep to produce wool.

The narrative focuses on the production of Sjenica dry sheep meat, indicating that the value chain involves sheep for their meat, not wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrela and the VC ID is 03 PT2. It talks about sheep breeds like Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira feeding on pastures in a specific area. They mention that these sheep are used for their milk, as they produce cheese and cottage cheese. The cheese production involves whey from another cheese (VC 02 PT2) and sometimes raw sheep's milk.

Wait, so the focus here is on dairy products—cheese and cottage cheese made from sheep's milk. There's no mention of wool being produced or used in any way. The narrative doesn't talk about shearing the sheep for their fleece or processing wool into textiles or anything like that. It's all about the milk and the cheese production.

I'm trying to think if there's any indirect reference to wool, but I don't see it. They mention the breeds of sheep, which are typically used for both meat and wool, but in this context, they're clearly talking about dairy products. The cooperative is involved in technical assistance related to cheese production, not wool.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused on dairy instead.

The narrative mentions that the value chain supports farmers who breed old animal breeds and sell their products. Specifically, it talks about old sheep breeds in the mountains. It also notes that this is a farmer-led initiative to revive traditional breeds adapted to the local environment. 

Now, while they do mention breeding old sheep breeds, the content doesn't explicitly state that these sheep are used for wool production. The focus seems more on preserving traditional breeds and selling their products, but without specific details about wool being a product involved.

I should consider whether it's implied. In many mountainous regions, sheep are commonly raised for wool. However, since the narrative doesn't mention wool specifically, I can't assume that. It might be possible they're raising sheep for meat or other products instead.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, with a card ID VC 05 CZ. It talks about farms involved in sheep breeding, sheep husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. They often use organic farming methods. The land use systems include natural areas and grazing meadows, along with the management of perennial grassland.

It also says that local assets are both natural and cultural. The value chain contributes to a typical image of farming in mountain areas and is complementary to those describing cattle and goat husbandry.

So, looking at this, sheep breeding and husbandry are definitely part of the activities mentioned. Sheep husbandry typically involves raising sheep for their meat, wool, or milk. Since the narrative doesn't specify that they're only raising sheep for meat, it's reasonable to assume that producing wool is a possible component here.

Additionally, the mention of grazing and managing grasslands supports the idea of sheep being part of the value chain, as sheep are commonly grazed on such lands. The fact that it's complementary to cattle and goat husbandry also suggests a diversified approach, which might include wool production from sheep.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 2760 does involve using sheep for wool production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2971 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the VC ID is VC 12 UK. It talks about Welsh Lamb having a PGI mark since 2003, which designates it as a protected geographical indication. This suggests that Welsh Lamb is recognized for its quality and specific rearing processes.

Further down, it mentions that lambs are tagged at birth and associated with specific farms. The production uses marginal mountainous land for high-quality food. It also notes that 80% of Welsh land mass is suited to livestock farming, and they use traditional non-intensive processes to rear lamb.

Nowhere in the narrative does it explicitly mention wool production. Instead, the focus seems to be on lamb as a meat product, with details about PGI status, rearing methods, tagging for traceability, and the suitability of mountainous land for livestock. There's no reference to sheep being sheared for their wool or any processing related to wool.

So, while the value chain involves sheep (specifically lambs), it doesn't indicate that they're producing wool. The emphasis is on meat production rather than fiber. Therefore, I conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2989 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that Serbia is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The VC is dominated by single dairy production and there's a secondary dairy school in Pirot that preserves traditional knowledge. It says there are around 13,000 sheep produced. 

Further down, it talks about products like Pirot kackavalj cheese and Pirot lamb being highly valued and recognized as PDO (Protected Designation of Origin). So they're making cheese from sheep milk and also raising lambs for meat.

The challenges mentioned include depopulation, economic issues, tourism pressures, and environmental degradation. They note that the number of sheep has decreased to 13,760 due to aging villages and a shift from grazing to stationary systems. There are also concerns about natural resource management and investments in small hydro power plants affecting water resources.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention wool at all. It focuses on dairy products (cheese) and lamb meat. So while they have a lot of sheep, it's not clear if any part of the chain involves shearing them for wool or processing it into textiles.

Therefore, since there's no direct reference to wool production, I should conclude that the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing wool. The narrative focuses on dairy products and lamb meat but does not mention wool production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the VC ID is 06 SCA. It talks about Norway having organic wheat, spelt, oats, and other cereals. Then it mentions stone mills in Selbu municipality, which are used for making granola with local organic honey and rapeseed oil.

The value chain's reference mountain chain is the Scandinavian Mountains (Scandes), specifically the area around Selbu. Selbu has a lake, forests, and mountains up to 1441 meters. The climate is humid continental with mild winters because of the sea nearby. It also notes that Selbu is known for traditional knitting.

Looking through all this information, I don't see any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus seems to be on organic cereals, stone mills, honey, rapeseed oil, and granola making. Traditional knitting might involve wool, but the narrative doesn't specify whether the value chain itself produces wool or uses it. It just mentions knitting as a known activity in the area.

Since there's no direct reference to sheep being used for wool within the value chain described, I should conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool production.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to provide a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions transhumance shepherds moving cattle over long distances in Spain. It talks about 8,000 head of cattle making a round trip for better pastures and climate. There's also mention of herdsmen traveling with their livestock, managing land, forests, water resources, and natural hazards.

Now, the key here is to determine if sheep are involved in wool production within this value chain. The narrative specifically refers to cattle, not sheep. Transhumance typically involves moving animals between pastures, but without explicit mention of sheep or wool processing, I can't assume that's part of this VC.

I should also consider the context given by the user: only use the content provided as context. No external knowledge is allowed. So, even if I know that transhumance often includes various livestock, including sheep, in other contexts, without it being stated here, I shouldn't infer it.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't mention sheep or wool production, the correct response is an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is 13 AT. There are about 94 sheep farmers in a cooperative called ARGE Glocknerlamm, which was founded in 2003. The cooperative processes and sells lamb products to private consumers, retailers, and regional gastronomy. They also have an event called Glocknerlamm-Fest connected to tourism for marketing.

Now, the key part is whether they produce wool. The narrative says they process and sell "lamb products." Lamb typically refers to meat, but sometimes it can include other products like wool. However, in this context, since they're selling to consumers and gastronomy, it's more likely that the primary product is meat rather than wool.

Additionally, the narrative mentions extensive grazing contributing to vegetation cover and water storage, which is common for sheep raised for meat or dairy, not necessarily for wool. There's no specific mention of wool production or processing in the text.

So, based on this, I don't see evidence that the value chain involves using sheep for wool. They seem focused on lamb products, likely meat.

The mountain value chain described does not appear to be involved in using sheep to produce wool. The narrative focuses on lamb products, primarily associated with meat and related sectors.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Slovakia, with a key activities section including sheep breeding, meat processing in a slaughterhouse, marketing, and selling. The key actors are domestic breeders, processors, and marketers from Slovakia. 

Looking at the primary, secondary, and tertiary sector shares, they're all focused on employment but don't directly mention wool production.

The narrative then talks about Slovakia producing lamb meat for export, especially to Italy. It mentions that there was low demand domestically but after the economic crisis and COVID-19 restrictions, domestic markets became more successful. The new marketing strategy is to sell sheep meat in the domestic market and increase consumer demand.

Under resources, it lists grassland or feed for sheep, the sheep themselves, and Slovak consumers demanding lamb meat. 

The challenges listed are low domestic demand for lamb meat and production issues where shepherds have trouble protecting their sheep from wolves, which are legally protected. The shepherds want to expand production but can't due to wolf threats.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of wool production. All the activities revolve around meat processing and marketing. There's no indication that the sheep are being used for their wool; instead, it's all about meat production and the challenges faced in that sector.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused solely on meat production.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to return the ID of the narrative in a JSON format; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the Almenland small local dairy produces various types of cheese from cow, sheep, and goat milk. So, they're using sheep's milk for cheese production. However, the question is specifically about producing wool. The narrative doesn't mention anything related to wool or textiles. It focuses on cheese production, marketing, challenges in milk supply, climate issues affecting pasture, and innovations in cheese processing.

I need to be precise here. Just because they use sheep for their milk doesn't mean they're involved in wool production. Wool would require shearing the sheep and processing that fleece into yarn or fabric, which isn't indicated in the text. The narrative is centered around dairy products, particularly cheese, not on the fiber or textile side.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned relate to milk production and pasture management, which again ties back to dairy rather than wool. There's no mention of sheep being raised for their fleece or any processing steps related to wool.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused on dairy products, specifically cheese.

The narrative mentions that kilim production is linked to traditional farming systems involving sheep grazing on mountain pastures. It specifically states that processing their wool is part of the tradition, which was recognized by UNESCO. This clearly indicates that sheep are used for their wool in this value chain.

Additionally, it talks about the decline in the local kilim industry due to market loss, but that doesn't change the fact that sheep wool is a key component here.

Innovations mentioned are allowing berry picking for recreation and learning, plus diversifying products like frozen berries and juice for year-round availability. Land use is cropland, with local assets being natural and social.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention sheep or wool production. It's all about raspberries and related products. So the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for wool production. The focus is on raspberry farming and associated products.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative is about a Value Chain (VC) based in Scotland, specifically mentioning SCOTLAND HUTTON as the reference member state and VC 04 UK as the Card ID. It talks about deer hunting or stalking being popular tourist activities in the Highlands and Islands. The land used for stalking is wild but managed, focusing on venison production to ensure high meat standards.

The narrative mentions Perth and Kinross Atholl estate conducting three-yearly surveys using drones, thermal imaging, and camera traps to count deer numbers. They aim to improve habitat quality and maintain healthy deer populations. It also notes that these methods can help assess the conflict between deer and hikers, as well as monitor sheep and bird populations.

Looking at the assets involved: natural assets rely on managed wild land for deer and grouse, contributing to scenic beauty for visitors. Social assets involve good relations with local communities, accommodation providers, hikers, and wildlife conservation groups. Cultural assets include traditional knowledge for stalking practices, including using ponies to remove deer trophies from the mountains.

Potential conflicts are mentioned with other agricultural activities, particularly sheep, and hillwalking. The narrative emphasizes reliance on internal processes but doesn't explicitly state that sheep are used for wool production.

So, while there's mention of sheep in the context of potential conflicts with agricultural activities, the focus is on deer stalking and habitat management. There's no direct indication that sheep are being raised or sheared for wool within this value chain. The primary products seem to be venison and tourism related, not wool.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain doesn't appear to involve using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is 10 AT. It talks about around 400 farmers connected via the Osttiroler Lämmerring, which is part of the Raiffeisen cooperative in East Tyrol. The key terms here are "sheep" and "wool production."

The narrative mentions that sheep husbandry is traditional, with specific breeds being cultivated. It also notes that marketing strategies are innovative, focusing on local specialties. Land use systems include pasture farming, which is common for sheep. Additionally, it states that the average number of sheep per farm in East Tyrol is 37.8, significantly higher than the national average.

Furthermore, it mentions that mountain sheep farming is traditional in other regions too, like VC AT 13 and 15, though not all are mountainous. The emphasis on sheep husbandry and marketing as a local specialty suggests they're involved in producing something from sheep, likely wool.

Putting this together, the value chain involves sheep farming, which typically includes wool production. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the mountain value chain is indeed using sheep for wool.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative specifically talks about goats being used for cheese. There's no indication that sheep are involved at all, let alone for wool production. It's focused on dairy products and marketing strategies related to cheese.

So, since the value chain is making cheese from goat milk and there's no reference to sheep or wool, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a reference member state called SKANDINAVIAN UCO and mentions Jønsi Gård on Hjuksebø in Telemark, Norway. They're known for being the largest producer of biodynamic apples since 1991. The farm has over 20 apple varieties and produces around 30-50 tons annually. There are also about 40 bee hives, which help with pollination and result in honey production.

Next, it mentions the reference mountain chain as the Scandinavian Mountains (Scandes) and the reference landscape as Notodden. Notodden is described as a mountainous area with water streams and waterfalls, historically linked to wood logging and hydropower energy. It's also noted that Telemark is one of Norway's four major fruit districts. Additionally, Notodden hosts a big blues festival and has a museum.

The narrative then goes into some statistical data about the area size, altitudes, population figures, density, and population change rates over the last decade. 

Now, looking for any mention related to sheep or wool production. The text talks about apples, bees, and honey, but there's no indication of sheep being part of this value chain. It focuses more on agriculture (apples) and energy from hydropower, along with cultural aspects like the blues festival.

So, based solely on the content provided, there's nothing suggesting that sheep are used for wool production in this mountain value chain.

The narrative does not mention sheep or wool production. It focuses on apples, bees, honey, and local industries like logging and hydropower.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, with a specific VC ID. It's made up of 11 manufacturers and ripeners along with milk producers from the Jura mountain areas. The focus seems to be on dairy production since they process and sell milk locally. They talk about agricultural holdings and some statistics regarding employment sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary.

They mention successfully registering a quality scheme with PDO, which stands for Protected Designation of Origin. This usually applies to products like cheeses that have specific geographical origins and traditional methods. The narrative emphasizes high-quality dairy products and maintaining milk prices despite market competition, especially with the EU. They're preserving pasturelands and extensive grazing in wooden pastures, which suggests they rely on cattle rather than sheep.

Further down, it's clear that dairy production is based on pastures, a natural asset that defines the Swiss cultural landscape. Grazing here depends on these landscapes, which in turn depend on cattle. If they weren't grazing, the land would revert to forests. The threats mentioned are related to climate change affecting natural resources used for milk—droughts leading to loss of fodder and spruce tree deaths in wooded pastures.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. It's all about dairy cows and their grazing, cheese production, and the challenges faced by dairy farmers. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain. The products discussed are high-quality milk and cheeses, not wool or textiles.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain is focused on dairy, not sheep for wool. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON; instead, it should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the given narrative carefully. It mentions that the moving reference member state is Scotland Hutton, with a reference card ID of VC 27 UK. The location specified is Gwent Valley, also known as Blaenau Gwent in Welsh (LAU1). The products listed include beeswax items such as candles, soaps, beauty products, and reusable food wraps instead of cling film. It also notes that these products are distributed across the UK, particularly connected with honey production ventures.

Now, I need to analyze whether this value chain involves sheep for wool production. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or wool at all. Instead, it's focused on beeswax and honey-related products. There's no indication of any connection to sheep farming or wool processing. 

I should also consider if there are any indirect references that might imply the use of sheep, but in this case, everything points towards bee-based products. The location mentioned is Gwent Valley, which I know from real-world knowledge is associated with various industries, including agriculture and manufacturing, but without specific information here about sheep or wool.

Since the narrative doesn't include any details related to sheep or wool production, it's safe to conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Austria and the lead product is ALMO, which stands for Almo Steirisches Almochsenfleisch. That translates to "Almo Styrian Alpine Cattle Meat." So right away, I'm noticing it's about meat production, specifically beef from cattle.

The narrative talks about challenges related to pasture areas and feed cultivation. It mentions that the producers are small-scale, often women-led farms, which are vulnerable economically. The focus seems to be on maintaining stable prices for their products. 

Further down, it discusses the type of innovation in the value chain as both endogenous and exogenous. They mention specific feeding practices developed to achieve high meat quality. There's a lot about regional development initiatives and cross-sectoral collaboration, but nothing about sheep or wool production.

I'm trying to see if there are any mentions of sheep or wool. The lead product is beef, so unless they're also producing wool on the side, which isn't indicated here, it doesn't seem like sheep are involved in this value chain. 

The narrative doesn't mention anything related to wool processing, textiles, or products derived from sheep fleece. It's all about meat production and the challenges associated with that sector.

So, putting it all together, since the primary product is beef and there's no indication of sheep being part of the process for wool, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

ID NARRATIVE: 2949
The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 RO. Specialist trading companies such as 'Seradria' have a network of partners managing collection points in the main sheep producing regions in Romania. 'Seradria' has annual capa
ep and lambs for slaughter with an estimated market value of 175 million EUR / year. This is an important value chain for sheep farmers in the Carpathians, especially for supporting the finacial viability of many small farms and thereby ensuring their continued existence and contribution to the maintenance of the traditional farming practices that are important for biodiversity conservation and the valued mountain landscapes.   The live sheep and lambs collected from local farms for export are usually from the most two common breeds found in the Carpathians - the Tsurcana breed (a traditional indigenous breed that was favoured by Romanian transhumance shepherds and is still very popular in mountain villages) and the Tsigai breed (a more recently introduced breed that is more common in the hilly sub-mountainous areas of the Carpathians).    The live export of sheep and lambs is highly controversial because of the animal welfare issues associated with transporting live animals over long distances. This tragically was brought to the attention of the global media in November 2019 when a cargo ship carrying almost 15,000 sheep capsized in the Black Sea shortly after leaving Romania for Saudi Arabia - for more details see here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/europe/romanian-sheep-cargo-ship.html.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2949 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that 'Seradria' collects live sheep and lambs for export, specifically from breeds like Tsurcana and Tsigai. It talks about their annual capacity and market value related to these exports. The main focus seems to be on the live export of sheep, not on producing wool. There's a mention of controversy regarding animal welfare during transportation but nothing about processing the sheep for wool or textiles.

I'm looking for any indication that the sheep are sheared for their wool. Since the narrative doesn't discuss wool production at all, it seems like the value chain is focused solely on live exports rather than utilizing the sheep's fleece. Therefore, I don't think this mountain value chain is involved in producing wool.

The mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep to produce wool; instead, it focuses on live export.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2861 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The VC is partially dependent on other local VCs for transformed products, like pasta and bread made from chestnut flour. It says these need to be mixed with wheat or rye bread. The farm owner recovered these productions for a market that appreciates local food, wine traditions, and environmental sustainability.

The knowledge and skills used are developed locally by the family farm and belong to the local tradition. The innovation is related to the whole VC. Land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. Local assets include Natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative talks about pasta, bread, chestnut flour, wheat, rye, food traditions, environmental sustainability, family farm skills, land use as cropland and forestry. There's no direct reference to sheep or wool anywhere in the text. It focuses more on agricultural products like grains and flour rather than animal-based products.

So, based on this, I don't see any indication that the value chain involves using sheep for wool production. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2994 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state and talks about livestock husbandry being the main agricultural activity on the Pester plateau. It specifically mentions lamb meat production as the basis of the value chain, with sheep farms in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania. 

It goes into detail about traditional knowledge related to livestock farming and the production of traditional products like cheese and dry meat. So far, it's clear that sheep are involved, but the focus is on meat rather than wool. The narrative also mentions family farming, grazing systems, challenges faced by farmers in 2020 due to lockdowns and weather issues, and problems with middlemen buying animals at low prices.

I'm looking for any mention of wool production. The narrative doesn't explicitly say that the sheep are used for their wool. Instead, it's focused on meat production and traditional products like cheese and dry meat, which could include dairy but not necessarily wool. There's no indication of wool processing or textile production in the value chain described.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain is primarily involved in lamb meat production rather than using sheep for wool. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative again carefully.

The narrative mentions that the main actors are breeders and farmers who collaborate in a cooperative company. They produce milk and cheeses. The key points here are "milk" and "cheeses." Now, I know that sheep are commonly raised for both their meat and their wool. However, in this case, the focus seems to be on dairy products.

The narrative doesn't mention anything about wool production or textiles. It specifically talks about milk and cheeses, which suggests that the primary product from the sheep is dairy rather than fiber. Since there's no indication of wool being used or processed, I can infer that the value chain isn't involved in producing wool.

Therefore, based on the information given, the mountain value chain doesn't use sheep for wool production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Switzerland and the VC (Value Chain) has a specific ID. It's composed of small-scale farming where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk, selling cheese directly on the farm. The milk is processed into various cheeses labeled as organic. 

So far, I see that sheep are involved in milk production for cheese. But the question is about using sheep to produce wool. The narrative doesn't mention anything about shearing sheep or processing wool. It focuses entirely on dairy products—cheese made from sheep's milk.

I should check if there's any other part of the text that talks about wool. Scanning through, I see references to the mountain landscape and cultural heritage like clock-making, but nothing related to wool production. The key points are all about milk and cheese.

Therefore, since the value chain is involved in sheep for milk and cheese, not wool, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3068 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Spain and a specific card ID. It mentions that Grazalema had a complete articulation in the textile production process, which flourished for over three centuries but faced several crises. Now, only one company continues this legacy, dealing with challenges like higher prices for handmade goods and economic downturns.

Further down, it says the land use systems involved are Sheep wool. That's a clear indication that sheep are part of the value chain. Additionally, it mentions other regions known for sheep wool production, reinforcing that sheep wool is indeed a component here.

So, putting this together, the narrative explicitly states that sheep wool is part of their land use systems, which means the mountain value chain does involve using sheep to produce wool.

The narrative ID is 3117. It mentions that the Moving reference member state is Switzerland, specifically Grisons. The initiative is called Veg Alp, started by gourmet chefs experimenting with local flavors, breeds, and species to create luxury foods. 

Hmm, so they're focusing on creating food products, but it's a vegan production in an alpine context. Wait, that's interesting because traditionally, the area is known for animal-based production. So Veg Alp is trying to shift towards plant-based or vegan alternatives.

The narrative also says it's classified as innovative with endogenous and exogenous innovation. The type of innovation relates to new products. Land use systems involved are cropland, which suggests they're focusing on plants rather than animals. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Nowhere in the description do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. Instead, it's about vegan foods, so they might be using plant-based materials instead. The focus is on luxury foods for restaurants and private customers, which doesn't align with wool production.

So, putting this together, since the value chain is centered around vegan products in an area traditionally known for animal husbandry, but specifically mentions food production without any reference to sheep or wool, I can conclude that they are not involved in using sheep for wool. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3084 involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Spain UCO and the reference card ID is VC 22 ES. It talks about goats producing various values, such as milk for traditional dishes and serving as a tourist attraction in Guadarrama National Park. There are also mentions of conflicts with other livestock producers over common lands and how neighbors play a role.

The narrative goes on to discuss the connection with the social-ecological system, where the herd provides benefits like fire prevention, cleaning public land, composting, cultural assets, and profitable activities. It references the Sierra del Guadarrama mountain chain and El Boalo as the reference landscape, which is part of the TERRAE Network focused on agroecology.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on goats and their various uses—milk for food, tourism, ecosystem services, etc. There's no indication that sheep are involved in any part of this value chain, whether for wool or any other product.

Therefore, since the mountain value chain here doesn't involve sheep for wool production, I should return an empty JSON object as specified.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2965 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and VC 04 UK as the card ID. It talks about deer hunting or stalking being a popular tourist activity in the Highlands and Islands. The land used is wild, but they use ponies to remove deer trophies from the mountain. 

Next, it discusses potential conflicts with other agricultural activities, specifically mentioning sheep. So there's a mention of "potential for or existing conflicts with other agricultural activities (i.e., sheep)" which suggests that sheep are involved in some way. However, the narrative doesn't specify whether these sheep are being used for wool production.

The rest of the narrative goes into details about tourism relying on international visitors, conflicts over land management practices like culling mountain hares and burning gorse, conflicts between organizations promoting deer culling and those visiting for stalking, grouse shooting affecting bird populations, difficulties in selling venison post-Brexit, risks of overgrazing, and the classification of the VC as Traditional and Innovative. It also mentions innovations in counting deer using technology like drones and camera traps, but nothing about sheep or wool.

So, while there's a mention of conflicts with sheep agriculture, it doesn't explicitly state that the value chain uses sheep for wool production. The focus seems to be more on deer stalking and grouse shooting as the main activities, with sheep being part of potential agricultural conflicts but not necessarily involved in wool production within this VC.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, I don't have enough information to confirm that the mountain value chain is using sheep for wool. The narrative doesn't describe any processes related to shearing or wool processing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France INRAE and the VC ID is 11 FR. It talks about "milk lamb" being seasonally produced, mostly in autumn, by around 300 dairy-ewe farmers. So, these are sheep that produce milk, which means they're likely dairy ewes.

The narrative mentions two associations of farmers involved in slaughtering the animals and transmitting information about breeds and feeding species to reconnect activities like milk lamb production with dairy production. The goal seems to be reconnecting food production with uses in cooking and eating habits, implying a focus on meat or perhaps other dairy products rather than wool.

It also discusses challenges faced by the VC, such as struggling to add value to their product. They collect milk lambs, send them to Sardinia for slaughter, get carcasses back, freeze some for later sale during tourist season. This suggests they're dealing with meat production, not wool.

There's a mention of a project for PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) for Corsican milk lamb, which again points towards meat rather than wool. The innovation is related to new processes in handling and selling the meat.

The land use systems include grassland, natural areas, and agrosylvopastoral systems like shrubs and oak forests, which are typical for grazing sheep but don't necessarily indicate wool production. Local assets are described as natural and cultural, which could relate to both meat and wool, but without specific mention of wool processing or products.

The VC is present in Austria and compared with other lamb productions focused on meat in countries like Switzerland, Serbia, and Spain. This comparison emphasizes meat production, not wool.

Putting it all together: The narrative focuses on milk lamb for meat, slaughter, and dairy production. There's no mention of wool being used or processed. Therefore, the mountain value chain is not involved in using sheep to produce wool.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing wool. It primarily focuses on milk lamb production for meat and dairy purposes.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Turkey, with a specific card ID VC 10 TR. It talks about cheese being produced on plateaus and pastures in Erzincan, where there are nearly half a million sheep. The cheese comes from the milk of White Karaman sheep.

Hmm, so they're using sheep for their milk to make cheese. But the question is whether they use sheep to produce wool. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention wool at all. It focuses on cheese production, which is dairy-based. There's no indication that the sheep are sheared for their wool or that any part of the value chain involves processing wool.

I should also consider if there's any indirect clue about wool. Since they're talking about a mountain value chain and sheep grazing, sometimes these chains can involve multiple products from sheep. But in this case, all the information points to dairy production—cheese specifically. There's no mention of textiles, clothing, or any other uses that would relate to wool.

Additionally, the narrative mentions organic honey production as part of the innovation but doesn't tie it to sheep. The local assets are natural and cultural, which might include grazing areas but not necessarily wool processing.

So putting this together, while sheep are definitely involved in the value chain for their milk, there's no evidence that they're used for wool production. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

It talks about employment percentages across different sectors—primary, secondary, tertiary—but I don't see any mention of sheep or wool here. Instead, it's focused on dairy production. The narrative mentions that the value chain uses raw milk for direct sales, which gives a better price per litre for farmers. It also discusses land use systems through pasture grazing, specifically mentioning cattle. 

There's a part about how dairy production is based on pastures, which are a natural asset in the Swiss mountains. Grazing depends on these landscapes, and those landscapes depend on cattle; otherwise, they'd revert to forests. So it's clear that cows are central here for milk production.

The narrative also touches on conservation challenges related to raw milk storage issues and climate change impacts like droughts affecting fodder and spruce trees in wooded pastures. Again, all these points revolve around dairy and cattle grazing, not sheep or wool.

I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool processing. The terms used are "raw milk," "dairy production," "cattle grazing." There's no indication that the value chain involves shearing sheep or producing wool products. It seems focused entirely on milk and its direct sales, with conservation efforts tied to maintaining pasture lands for cattle.

So, putting it all together, the mountain value chain here is about dairy, not wool from sheep. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 UK. Fly fishing of wild salmon is an important value chain in the Scottish Highlands. Generally, the fish are caught and then returned to the river (relatively) unharmed to
inatin fish stocks).   Natural - importance of maintaining scenery for nice surroundings for fly fishing, maintaining quality of river catchment so fish stocks remain high. Social - good relations with communities and lacndowners for welcoming (and allowing access) tourists and sharing rivers with locals (and vice versa). Cultural - relies of traditional fly fishing methods and good local knowledge of good areas for salmon catches.    Activities on the upper levels of the rivers/ lochs can impact on the populations of salmon lower down (and then have a knock on economic impact). This could include chnages to the river course becuase of flooing/ potential flooding. If numbers of permits were to increase this may reduce the likelihoods of successful catches and again have a knock on economic impact. Less tourist numbers visiting due to COVID-19/ Brexit. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Traditional because fy fishing has occurred in these areas for many years. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Rivers. The local assets include Natural, Social and Cultural.   Fly fishing for salmon also occurs in other areas across the Highlands and Islands region including Aberdeenshire (River Dee), Caithness and Sutherland, Inverness and Nairn. Trout fishing is another Value Chain prominent in mountainous lochs

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference card ID is VC 06 UK. It talks about fly fishing for wild salmon being an important part of the value chain in the Scottish Highlands. The focus here is on catching and releasing salmon to maintain fish stocks. 

It goes into details about natural, social, and cultural aspects related to fly fishing. For example, maintaining river catchment quality, good relations with communities, traditional methods, etc. It also discusses potential impacts like changes in river courses due to flooding or tourism numbers dropping because of COVID-19 or Brexit.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep, wool production, or anything related to that. The activities described are all about fishing—specifically fly fishing for salmon and trout. There's no indication that the value chain involves livestock like sheep or their products such as wool.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain here is not involved in using sheep to produce wool. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. It starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, with a specific VC ID. The value chain is described as broad, including producers, slaughterhouses, and retailers like department stores, local butchers, and direct sales from farms. 

Next, it talks about farmers complying with holdings in the LAU region, which has a population of 2267. The nearest big settlement is 55 km away, and there are protected areas present. Then, it provides statistics on employment shares across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors for both the province and region.

The narrative then shifts to the product being high quality, adhering to strict organic and ethical production standards. It mentions that calves grow with their mothers, which is connected to cattle farming as the main farming system in Switzerland. This suggests that the value chain is centered around cattle rather than sheep.

Further details highlight natural resources like pastures and crops used for feeding cattle during winter. The challenges mentioned are related to climate change affecting these resources—droughts leading to loss of fodder, death of spruce trees, changes in grassland production, and animal health issues. All these points revolve around cattle farming and its sustainability.

Nowhere in the narrative is there a mention of sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on cattle, their grazing pastures, feed crops, and the challenges faced due to climate change. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain, let alone producing wool.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain in question does not involve using sheep for wool production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3009 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the Card ID is VC 03 SCA. It talks about around 6500 Sami people engaged in reindeer herding in Scandinavia, specifically in Norway and Sweden. It also notes that only Sami with ancestors linked to reindeer herding have the right, and it mentions areas like Lapland and Oulu, covering a significant portion of the country's surface.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The key terms here are "reindeer herding." Reindeer are different from sheep, and while both are livestock, they serve different purposes. Reindeer are typically raised for their meat, hides, and antlers rather than wool. Sheep, on the other hand, are specifically bred for their wool.

The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep at all. It's focused entirely on reindeer herding by the Sami people. There's no indication of any involvement in raising sheep or producing wool. Therefore, based solely on this content, I can conclude that the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in using sheep for wool production.

So, since there's no mention of sheep or wool, the correct response should be an empty JSON object.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 26 ES. Then it talks about Siete Valles de Montaña being the first cooperative of organic livestock farmers in Cantabria. They unite for four reasons: animal welfare, consumer health, sustainability, and rural territories.

The challenges they face are current, and the value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative. The innovation types are endogenous and exogenous. It highlights certified organic production, cooperative structure, and direct marketing channels as key innovations. The areas of innovation include new processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems.

Land use systems involved are grassland, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. Other European mountain regions have similar initiatives with cooperatives for organic meat producers who market through short channels.

Now, looking for mentions related to sheep and wool production. The narrative talks about livestock farmers but doesn't specify the type of animals. It mentions organic meat producers, which typically refers to animals raised for meat, not necessarily sheep for wool. There's no explicit mention of wool or sheep being used for that purpose.

So, based on this content alone, there's no indication that the value chain uses sheep for wool production. They focus more on animal welfare and sustainability in their production methods but don't specify wool as a product.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions the Highlands and Islands as part of the value chain. It discusses wildlife tourism, including marine, coastal, and mountain species. Tour operators are highlighted, both national and local, offering flexible tours. There's a mention of the economic impact on wildlife tourism in 2010, valued at £124 million.

The narrative also touches on local markets for wildlife and birdwatching, linking them to physical and mental well-being. However, it points out challenges in defining this value chain distinct from other countryside tourism. It emphasizes non-specific experiences contributing to tourist motivations and satisfaction, which can lead to return visits.

Nowhere in the content is there any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus seems entirely on tourism aspects—wildlife, landscapes, tour operators, economic impact. There's no indication that the value chain involves agriculture, specifically sheep farming for wool.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't discuss sheep or wool production, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) includes mainly farmers who produce something, along with local retailers and consumers. It says the product is processed directly on the farm by the farmers themselves. 

Next, it talks about protected areas and gives some statistics on employment across different sectors in the province and region. These stats include primary, secondary, and tertiary sector shares but don't mention sheep or wool specifically.

Then, the narrative discusses grazing areas, noting that while cow cattle is the main land use system in Swiss mountains, there are other uses. It mentions pasture land being threatened by climate change, with issues like summer droughts and uncertainties about grassland production and animal health. 

Importantly, it states that dairy production is based on pastures, which are a natural asset representing the typical Swiss cultural landscape. Grazing depends on these landscapes, which in turn depend on cattle—otherwise, they'd revert to forests. The transformation into cheese involves traditional knowledge since it's produced artisanally.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention sheep or wool production. It focuses on dairy and cattle grazing. Even though there are other uses of grazing areas besides cows, the specific products discussed are related to dairy and cheese, not wool from sheep.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain doesn't involve using sheep to produce wool.

It says the value chain is present in all Swiss Alps and has several labels like organic, 'from alps', and national park labels. It's described as very traditional and part of Swiss identity. 

Next, it talks about Pro Montagna being in place and how alpine livestock maintains the landscape. The most common and traditional VC in the area is linked to culture and identity, producing high-quality sought-after products. The production process is ideal for the area with some labels mentioned.

Then there are challenges: dry summers mean not enough hay for winter, making it labor-intensive and with not very big revenue. The type of challenge isn't specified, and the VC is classified as N/A. Innovation in the VC is also unspecified but relates to the whole chain. Land use systems and local assets are listed as N/A.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative does talk about alpine livestock maintaining the landscape, which could include sheep since they're common in such regions. However, it doesn't explicitly state that sheep are used for wool. It mentions high-quality products but doesn't specify if those are wool-related.

Since there's no direct mention of sheep being used for wool production, I can't confirm that this VC is involved in that activity. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the VC (Value Chain) ID is VC45 CH2. It says the VC is very short, involving farmers and potentially resellers in local markets. The main product here seems to be raw milk used for cheese production. 

It talks about challenges like increasing droughts affecting fodder and spruce trees, which are part of the landscape and provide shade. There's uncertainty about how climate change impacts grassland production and animal health—like reduced grass growth but a longer growing season in some scenarios.

The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation type is Endogenous, meaning it comes from within the system. It mentions a return to earlier traditional forms of milk, which stands out from industrial milk. The marketing strategies are new, focusing on raw milk sales throughout Switzerland, especially in mountain regions near grazing areas.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention sheep or wool production. They're focused on dairy—raw milk and cheese. There's no reference to textiles, clothing, or any products made from wool. So, it seems like the value chain is centered around dairy rather than sheep for wool.

Therefore, since there's no indication that sheep are used here for their wool, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2733 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is exogenous and involves organic farmers producing hay milk. They supply this to a regional dairy which processes it into various dairy products, sold exclusively within the VC. The innovations here are related to new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. 

Looking at the land use systems, it mentions grassland and pasture farming. Local assets include natural and cultural aspects. There's also a note about other hay milk VCs in Austria but this one being unique due to its specific labelling scheme.

Now, I'm trying to see if sheep are involved for wool production. The narrative talks about hay milk, which comes from dairy cows or possibly goats, but there's no mention of sheep at all. It focuses on dairy products and the processes around that. Since wool production would typically involve shearing sheep and processing their fleece, and there's nothing here indicating that, I don't think sheep are part of this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in narrative 2733 isn't involved in using sheep for wool production.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep to produce wool. It focuses on hay milk and dairy products without mentioning sheep or wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2968 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with the reference member state being Scotland Hutton and the Card ID VC 08 UK. The key activities mentioned are tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna. The key actors include land owners like NGOs or wealthy philanthropists, consultants, students, and academics.

It mentions that rewilding projects started in 2003 with Alladale Estate and have grown due to climate and biodiversity concerns. Innovations involve changes in ownership, often by external owners who bring in expert consultants for monitoring and ecological measures. Sometimes they need contractors for things like tree planting, which aren't available locally. However, the estates prioritize local volunteers and training people in conservation jobs.

The innovation relates to new products, processes, and governance systems. The land use systems involved are cropland, grassland, forestry, natural land, and freshwater wetlands. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

It also lists several rewilding projects in Scotland, England, but none in Wales or Northern Ireland.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. Looking through the narrative, I don't see any mention of sheep, wool, or related activities. The focus seems to be on rewilding, tree planting, habitat restoration, and ecological monitoring. There's no indication that sheep are part of their operations or product chain.

Therefore, since there's no information about sheep or wool production in the narrative, I should return an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain in the given narrative involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative is about a Value Chain (VC) with ID 2973, associated with Scotland Hutton and the reference card VC14 UK. It talks about Highland cattle being symbolic of Scotland and their role as a cultural asset. They mention that Highland Cattle are kept for both cultural reasons and because of their good genetics.

The narrative goes on to discuss how these cows are used in marketing, such as through Visit Scotland and Highland Cow Safaris, to attract tourists. It also mentions that they live on poor mountainous terrain in Lochaber LAU1 and help with conservation by supporting butterflies and wildflowers. Additionally, the cattle contribute to the local scenery and serve as a cultural link between Scotland and its land.

Challenges include tourists getting too close for selfies and issues if their meat or genetics become less favorable in the market. There's also a mention of potential difficulties if Scotland becomes less attractive to tourists.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain involves sheep for wool production. The narrative is focused entirely on Highland Cattle—how they're used culturally, economically, and their impact on tourism and conservation. There's no mention of sheep at all in the text. It doesn't talk about wool production, shearing, or any related activities.

Since the entire discussion revolves around cattle and not sheep, it seems clear that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should return an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state PORTUGAL ESTRELA and a specific card ID. It mentions Serra da Estrela Lamb PDO meat, which comes from lambs of the Bordaleira Serra da Estrela breed. These lambs are fed only breast milk and have certain weight and age specifications at slaughter.

Then it goes on to describe where this product is sold—locally and in urban centers during festive seasons—and that it's also cooked and served in local restaurants. So far, the focus seems to be on meat production, specifically lamb meat.

Next, the narrative references the mountain chain as Cordilheira Central (RR08) and mentions Manteigas as a reference mountain landscape. It describes Manteigas as having stunning landscapes with historical economic activities related to pastoralism, sheep's cheese production, and wool industry. 

Wait, here it says that historically, the main economic activities include pastoralism, sheep's cheese, and wool industry. So this suggests that sheep are used not just for meat but also for their milk (cheese) and wool.

But looking back at the specific VC details, the narrative focuses on Serra da Estrela Lamb PDO meat. It doesn't explicitly mention wool production in the context of this particular value chain. The historical activities include wool, but is that part of the current VC?

The narrative mentions that the VC's reference mountain landscape has a history of wool industry, but it doesn't state whether the VC itself involves wool production. The main product discussed is the lamb meat.

So, while sheep are involved in multiple industries in the region, the specific value chain described here seems to be focused on meat production. There's no direct mention of using sheep for wool in this particular VC.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain isn't explicitly involved in producing wool from sheep.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain mentioned in the narrative uses sheep to produce wool. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state of the VC is NMK, and the reference card ID is VC 12 NMK. It talks about private owners breeding sheep and selling lambs collectively. That already hints at sheep being involved in some capacity.

Next, it references the mountain chain as Mountain Meleshevija. The narrative then goes into various economic sectors' contributions to GVA (Gross Value Added) for both the province and region. These stats include percentages from primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, along with per capita income and total GVA figures. While these are important for understanding the region's economy, they don't directly indicate whether wool production is involved.

Further down, there's information about tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, and protected areas in the region. Again, not directly related to sheep wool but contextually relevant.

The narrative then shifts focus to employment shares across sectors at both province and regional levels. Still, no mention of wool here.

Finally, the crucial part comes: "Sheep breeding is a traditional activity of Maleshevija, while for lamb meat is well recognized as a quality product across the country and even beyond." This clearly states that sheep are bred in the region, but it specifically mentions lamb meat. The focus here seems to be on meat production rather than wool.

So, putting this together: While sheep are indeed part of the value chain, the narrative emphasizes their role in producing lamb meat. There's no explicit mention of wool being produced or used. Therefore, based solely on the content provided, I can't confirm that the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep for wool production.

I should also consider if there's any implicit information suggesting wool production. For example, sometimes regions known for sheep breeding might also produce wool, but without explicit mention, it's safer to stick with what's given. The narrative doesn't provide details about wool processing or textile industries, which would be indicators of involvement in wool production.

Therefore, since the narrative focuses on lamb meat and not wool, I conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative again carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Portugal Estrela, and the reference card ID is VC 12 PT2. Then it talks about "Wild Zimbro from Serra da Estrela" being harvested by shepherds. After that, it says it's fermented and distilled in traditional alembics to make Zimbro Brandy, which is sold nationally and internationally.

Hmm, so the key points here are Wild Zimbro, shepherds harvesting it, fermentation, distillation into brandy, and then selling. Now, I'm trying to connect this to sheep and wool production. 

Sheep are commonly associated with producing wool, but in this case, the narrative doesn't mention anything about wool at all. Instead, it's talking about Zimbro, which I think might be a type of plant or herb since it's being harvested by shepherds and then used to make brandy. The process involves fermentation and distillation, which are more related to making alcohol rather than processing wool.

Also, the local assets mentioned are natural, which could refer to the environment where Zimbro grows, not necessarily sheep grazing areas for wool production. There's no mention of shearing sheep, spinning wool, or any textile-related activities here.

So putting it all together, the value chain described is about producing a brandy from Wild Zimbro, not about using sheep for their wool. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in wool production.

The narrative describes a value chain focused on producing Zimbro Brandy from Wild Zimbro, involving shepherds but not sheep for wool.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, with a specific card ID. It says producers aren't necessarily in the mountains but are associated with livestock farms aiming for diversification and valorization. They're targeting mainstream consumers by creating new marketing channels and using symbolic features of the mountain region, like 'pure nature' and traditions.

It talks about the Sumava Mountains having picturesque landscapes and unique natural aspects. The area was partly abandoned during the socialist era but has seen farm renewals based on pre-WWII traditions. It's attractive for tourism in both winter and summer seasons, which producers use in product names and descriptions to emphasize symbolic resources.

The main challenges are marketing and hygienic rules requiring high investments. Successful meat producers rely on quality inputs from their own farms. The VC is compared to cattle husbandry in terms of challenges and is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type. It mentions land use systems like grassland and forestry, and local assets but doesn't specify the animals involved beyond livestock.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative discusses meat products and marketing strategies using symbolic features, but there's no direct reference to sheep or wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative ID 3012 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of SKANDINAVIAN UCO and a specific Card ID, VC 06 SCA. It mentions Norway's organic wheat, spelt, oats, and other spring cereals. There are statistics about employment sectors in the region—primary, secondary, tertiary. The primary sector is quite low at around 2-3%, which suggests it's not heavily agricultural.

The narrative then discusses granola production made with local cereals processed in traditional stone mills. It highlights organic fields of spelt and oats as the natural asset for this VC. There's also mention of a regional brand, AUK - TASTE FROM STJØRDALSFØRET, which involves local producers collaborating to promote their products.

The competition is noted with industrial products like sweets, cereals, and snacks. Additionally, there's a decrease in hectares dedicated to organic oats since 2012 in Norway.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus seems to be on cereal crops, granola processing, and brand collaboration for marketing. There's no indication that the VC involves sheep farming or wool processing. Therefore, it doesn't seem like the mountain value chain here is involved with using sheep for wool.

They're looking for people to manage the herd and have a School of Shepherds each year. There's also a tourism initiative called 'Shepherd the goat.'

Nowhere in this narrative do they talk about sheep or wool production. It's all about goats—milk, meat, tourism. So, since the question is whether the VC uses sheep for wool, and there's no mention of sheep at all, I can conclude that it doesn't involve sheep wool production.

Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3101 uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the VC is present in all Swiss alps and has several labels like organic, 'from alps', national park labels, etc. It's described as very traditional and part of Swiss identity. The challenges include threats to mountain plants from dryness, lack of sun, predators like insects and fungus. The classification is Traditional, innovation type unspecified, land use systems are vineyards on steep formerly open land, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention sheep or wool production. It talks about mountain plants and vineyards but not livestock or textiles. So, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for wool.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative ID 2974 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions a Value Chain (VC) with ID VC15 UK. It discusses how Scottish heather is used for making honey and jewelry. Specifically, it says that the woody stems of heather provide no nutritional value for wildlife, so they're used in jewelry. 

The value chain is described as being endogenous and exogenous, innovative through traditional processes for heather jewelry and new marketing strategies like online stores and Etsy. The land use system involved is natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects.

It also mentions that while there aren't other examples of heather jewelry in other MRLs, there are pressed flower jewelry examples by small producers on Etsy throughout the UK.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on heather and its uses—honey and jewelry. There's no reference to livestock, textiles, or any process related to shearing sheep for their wool. 

Therefore, since the value chain isn't involved with sheep or wool production, I should return an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, with a specific card ID. It says the VC includes farmers, local retailers, and consumers because the product is processed on the farm. The cooperative is called DorignoL, and they have labels like 'produit des parcs suisses' or 'parc du Jura Vaudois.' 

The reference mountain chain is the Jura, with specific landscapes in Gimel and Vaulion. It describes the area as having limestone rocks that are permeable, leading to shallow valleys and high plateaus. The landscape is covered by forests and wooded pastures. 

Agriculture here focuses on milk and cheese production, which are their main resources. There's also mention of clock-making by farmers since the Middle Ages, adding cultural heritage. 

Looking at the numbers: area size is 3.20 km², altitudes range from 670 to 1496 meters, population around 2.73 thousand with a density of 85.33 per km² and a population growth rate of 23.11% over the last decade.

Now, I'm trying to see if sheep are involved in wool production. The narrative mentions milk and cheese as primary agricultural products. While sheep are often used for both meat and wool, here it's focused on dairy products. There's no explicit mention of wool or sheep being raised specifically for their fleece. 

The cooperative is named DorignoL, but without knowing more about that, I can't assume they produce wool. The landscape description includes wooded pastures, which might suggest grazing areas, but again, it doesn't specify the type of livestock beyond what's needed for dairy.

So, based on the information given, the value chain is centered around milk and cheese production, not wool from sheep. Therefore, I don't think they're involved in using sheep for wool.

The mountain value chain described focuses on milk and cheese production, with no mention of sheep being used for wool.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce wool. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and VC 15 UK as the card ID. It talks about Scottish heather being used for honey and jewelry making. Specifically, it highlights that the woody stems of heather are used in jewelry, not for nutritional purposes.

Looking further, the processing steps involve traditional methods for Heathergems, which sell their products online. The assets mentioned include natural (heather from mountains), cultural (traditional knowledge over 50 years), and social (good relationships with landowners). Challenges include relying on heather production and potential competition from larger producers.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or wool production. It's all about heather processing for jewelry. So, the value chain here isn't involved with sheep or wool at all.

Therefore, since the mountain value chain doesn't use sheep to produce wool, I should return an empty JSON as specified.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the Value Chain (VC) ID is VC 26 ES. The cooperative is called Siete Valles de Montaña, which is the first cooperative of organic livestock farmers in Cantabria. They are united for four reasons: animal welfare, consumer health, environmental protection, and maintaining their chosen lifestyle.

They mention that some members are third or fourth-generation farmers, while others have been there for only three years. Their main focus seems to be on creating quality products that are healthy, have authentic flavor, protect the environment, and follow the slow philosophy.

The narrative then talks about their livestock: they have between 30 and 100 cows of Charolais and Limousin breeds grazing extensively on medium-sized farms. The products they offer include churrasco, entrecote, sirloin steak, minced meat, and lots that are served at home across Spain and sold in stores in Cantabria and Vizcaya.

The reference mountain chain is the Cantabrian Mountains, with the Polaciones valley being the highest in Cantabria. It's described as rugged, with heights over 2000 meters, and mentions forests with oak, beech, holly, or birch trees.

Now, looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative doesn't use words like "sheep," "wool," "fleece," or related terms. It focuses entirely on cows and their meat products. There's no indication that they're involved in raising sheep for wool. They are a cooperative of organic livestock farmers, but the specific animals mentioned are cows.

Therefore, since there's no mention of sheep or wool production, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2906 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is NMK and the card ID is VC 09 NMK. It talks about key actors dealing with cheese, specifically naming several companies like Maleshevo milk Berovo, Mlekara Malesh, Mlekara Natasha, and Farma Pacarski. These all seem to be involved in dairy products since they're named after milk-related terms.

The narrative also mentions that the innovation is related to new products and processes, and the land use systems include grassland, forestry, and natural land. The local assets are social and cultural. It further states that the cheese value chain is present in other member states but doesn't mention anything about sheep or wool production.

Since all the key actors and products mentioned are focused on cheese, which comes from milk, there's no indication here that sheep are involved for their wool. Cheese production typically involves cows or other dairy animals, not sheep specifically for wool. Therefore, I don't see any evidence in this narrative that the mountain value chain uses sheep to produce wool.

The main activity here is the breeding of Limousine beef cattle. These are native to France's Massif Central and were introduced in the 1970s to recover pastures and marginal areas. The farm is involved in recovering an old variety of corn called 'ottofile.' They're adopting new marketing strategies and governance systems as part of their innovation, which is endogenous.

The farm follows ethical agriculture practices, focusing on environmental, landscape, social, cultural aspects, consumer relationships, and animal welfare. The cows graze freely from May to October and are fed hay and cereals grown on the farm during the rest of the year.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on beef cattle and corn. So, it seems like the mountain value chain here isn't involved with sheep for wool.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the mountain value chain described here is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Serbia and the VC ID is 3001. It talks about Pirot white cheese being produced in the Pirot/Old Mountain area, which can be made from sheep, cow, or mixed milk. It specifically notes that sheep and mixed cheeses have a higher reputation among customers.

Then it goes on to talk about problems with finding professional shepherds, leading to a lack of sheep milk, so more cow cheese is produced. There's mention of the reduction in sheep herds, particularly autochthonous breeds like Pirot and Karakachan sheep, which are used for both meat and milk. The challenges include demographics where young people are leaving the area.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. It mentions that cheese production is mostly done in small on-farm units and there's a dairy school involved in producing white cheese and hard cheese. They're trying to improve online marketing and promotional strategies.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain uses sheep for wool production. The narrative discusses sheep milk for cheese but doesn't mention anything about using sheep for their wool. It focuses on the challenges of shepherding affecting milk supply and the impact on local breeds, but not on wool production or textiles.

So, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that the mountain value chain is involved in producing wool from sheep. The emphasis is on dairy products, specifically cheese, rather than wool.

It specifically talks about nearly half a million sheep and the White Karaman sheep breed. These sheep graze on plateaus and pastures, contributing to milk production for cheese. 

Now, the key here is whether the value chain uses sheep for wool or just for dairy. The narrative doesn't mention anything about wool production. It focuses entirely on cheese made from sheep's milk. There's no reference to shearing sheep for their fleece or any processing related to wool.

I should also consider if there's any indirect involvement, like byproducts, but the text clearly states that cheese is produced without adding anything except rennet and salt. So, it's purely dairy-based.

Since the narrative doesn't mention wool at all, I can confidently say that the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing wool from sheep. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton, and the products involved are Highland Spring and Tesco Perthsire mineral waters. It talks about extracting spring water from protected catchment sources in the Ochil Hills, bottling them, and distributing to various places like supermarkets and restaurants.

I notice that the narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or wool production. Instead, it's focused on water extraction, bottling, and distribution. There are mentions of environmental aspects, like the habitat for wild deer, rabbits, bees, and birds, but no indication of livestock farming related to sheep for wool.

The value chain here seems to be centered around mineral water, not textiles or agriculture involving sheep. Even though there's a mention of grazing by wild animals, it doesn't specify that sheep are part of the process. The companies involved, like Highland Spring Group and Tesco, are in the beverage industry, which doesn't align with wool production.

So, after carefully analyzing the content, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France CCVD and the VC ID is 07 FR1. It talks about Picodon AOP being a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region, which is representative of middle mountain agriculture. So right away, I see that it's goat milk, not sheep.

The quality label AOP has strict requirements, and they mention ecosystemic services like preventing fires through pasture practices and preserving middle mountain agriculture. The value chain includes both farmers who practice pastoralisme and dairy producers in companies. They face challenges like wolf predation, droughts, biodiversity impacts, diseases, and parasites. There's also a mention of valorizing goat meat to diversify for small producers.

Looking at the land use systems, it mentions grassland and forestry. The local assets are social and cultural. It also notes that Picodon AOP is made from goat milk in three departments.

Nowhere in this narrative do they talk about sheep or wool production. They're focused on goats and their products—cheese and meat. So the value chain here isn't involved with sheep for wool; it's all about goats.

Therefore, since the mountain value chain doesn't involve using sheep to produce wool, I should return an empty JSON object.

However, most expertise is exogenous to the locality.   As described above, these estates are fairly typical of upland Scottish estates - mix of forestry, semi-natural habitats and rough grazing - some designated areas under EU Natura 2000 or UK designation, sheep and cattle grazing and potentially hunting deer - but have been repurposed to reduce production of timber and meat (there is some timber/lamb production) and increase the production of public goods (regulating and cultural ecosystem services).

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state Scotland Hutton and key activities like tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna. The key actors are land owners such as NGOs or wealthy philanthropists, consultants, students, and academics involved in R&D.

It mentions two specific projects: Bunloit estate and the 'Lifescape' project near Loch Ness. These focus on increasing biodiversity, reaching net zero through eco-homes, and using extensive grazing and natural regeneration. They also participate in national and international networks and collaborate with academic partners for research.

The narrative notes that the estates are typical of upland Scottish ones, involving forestry, semi-natural habitats, rough grazing, sheep and cattle grazing, and possibly hunting deer. However, it mentions a shift from producing timber and meat towards public goods like regulating and cultural ecosystem services. It also states there's some limited local knowledge accessed through citizen science and volunteering with local farmers.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep for wool production. The narrative does mention sheep grazing but doesn't specify if they're raised for wool. Instead, it focuses on reducing timber and meat production to increase public goods. There's no explicit mention of wool or textile production as part of their activities.

So, while sheep are part of the land use, there's no indication that the VC is involved in producing wool from them. The emphasis seems more on ecological restoration and biodiversity rather than livestock products like wool.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not explicitly involve using sheep to produce wool. While sheep grazing is mentioned, the focus is on ecological restoration and reducing meat production rather than wool production.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if a mountain value chain mentioned in a narrative uses sheep for wool production. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, looking at the given narrative:

ID: 2773
The MOVING reference member state is the Czech Republic. The reference card ID is VC 18 CZ. Producers aren't necessarily in the mountains but are associated with livestock farms aiming for diversification and valorization in both process-based and product-based ways. Innovation relates to the whole value chain. Land use systems include Grassland and Forestry, with local assets being Cultural.

Now, I need to check if sheep wool production is involved here. The narrative mentions livestock farms but doesn't specify which animals they keep. It talks about diversification and valorization, which could involve various products like meat, dairy, or wool. However, without explicit mention of sheep or wool, it's unclear if that's part of their activities.

The land use systems are Grassland and Forestry, which are common for grazing but don't confirm sheep specifically. The cultural aspect might relate to traditional practices, but again, not directly pointing to wool production.

Since there's no direct evidence of sheep or wool in the narrative, I can't assume it's involved in wool production. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    For very traditional products, like 'Sirene' cheese, that are produced by small-scale farmers the main challenge is how to 'add value' to the product in order to increase farm / household income. This is a particular problem in locations such as Chiprovtsi Municipality where a) infrastucture is poor and the opportunity to regularly visit organised farmers' markets in the main cities is very limited; b) there is a lack of commercial processing units to produce higher quality products; c) knowledge of direct marketing is limited, and; d) there is no regional brand - or 'mountain products' brand (see below).

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Bulgaria, with the reference card ID VC 06 BG. It says most products are commonly made from sheep, cow, or goat milk, sometimes a mixture. So right away, it mentions sheep as one of the sources for their dairy products.

Next, it talks about varying degrees of aging and issues faced by farmers in selling their products locally. The narrative then discusses how access to common grasslands is prioritized based on CAP payments, with better pastures going to those who can pay more. It also mentions subsistence farmers using poorer pastures.

Further down, the main challenge for traditional products like 'Sirene' cheese is adding value because of infrastructure issues and lack of processing units. The VC is classified as Traditional, with land use systems involving grassland and local assets being natural.

Nowhere in this narrative does it specifically mention wool production. It's all about dairy products—sheep milk, cow milk, goat milk. So while sheep are involved, it's for milk, not wool. There's no indication that the value chain processes sheep for their wool.

Therefore, since the focus is on milk and cheese rather than wool, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON. The answer should be an empty JSON.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Scotland Hutton and a Card ID VC 28 UK. It mentions breakfast puddings like haggis and Stornoway black pudding as important Scottish exports. The export value for haggis is given as £8.8 million, which suggests it's a significant product.

Looking at the assets, there are strong social links between farmers, crofters, butchers, and tourism providers. Cultural aspects include traditional knowledge about pudding production, crofting, and livestock farming. It also notes that haggis and black pudding are cultural icons for Scottish food.

The challenges mentioned are related to tourism, Brexit, COVID, maintaining land use, climate change impacts on livestock farming, and the risk of 'imposters' affecting non-protected puddings. The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation, relying on existing systems for many years.

Land use systems involved are grassland and natural land, which supports livestock farming. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural elements.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention sheep being used for wool production. Instead, the focus is on producing haggis and black pudding, which are meat-based products. The emphasis is on food production, specifically traditional Scottish breakfast puddings, not textiles or wool-related industries.

Therefore, since the value chain revolves around food products made from livestock but doesn't specify sheep for wool, it's safe to conclude that they aren't involved in producing wool from sheep.

The mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep to produce wool. It focuses on the production of haggis and black pudding, which are meat-based products, rather than textiles or wool.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2898 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state NMK and reference Card ID VC 01 NMK. It mentions that there's no consolidated VC for this product, which might mean it's not well-established or organized. The reference mountain chain is Mountain Meleshevija, but the landscape isn't specified.

Next, it says that production is in a very clean environment, like Maleshevija, and the products have rare values. It specifically mentions the production of Juniper essential oil, noting that this production varies due to climate change. There are issues with chemicals being used sometimes wrongly or unnecessarily. Again, it's stated that there isn't a consolidated VC for this product.

The challenges faced by this VC are both current and predicted, and it's classified as Traditional. The type of innovation is unspecified, but Juniper essential oil is used in various innovative products related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land, with local assets including Social and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if sheep and wool production are part of this value chain. Looking through the narrative, there's no mention of sheep or wool at all. Instead, it focuses on Juniper essential oil, which is derived from the Juniper tree. Essential oils are typically extracted from plants, not animals like sheep.

Sheep farming involves raising sheep for their meat, milk, or wool. Since the narrative doesn't reference any animal husbandry practices, products related to sheep aren't part of this VC. The production processes described involve natural land and forestry, which align more with plant-based resources rather than livestock.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing wool. It focuses on Juniper essential oil production from natural and forested areas without mentioning any animal-based products.

The creation of a local abbatoir is also of interest to shorten the supply chains and the imapcts on the environment.   Natural assets: The importance of maintaining the landscape and land use so it suitable for scotch beef, and simultaneously these cattle and improve the natural asset. Social assets - strong relationships throughout the value chain to ensure that the PGI status is maintained and to create the local abbatoir. Also good relations amongst the cattle farmers who often rear cattle on upland common grazing (shared land for farming). Social assets have also been strengthened through the recent scotch beef monitor farm project within Skye and Lochalsh. Cultural assets are the reliance and cotinuation of traditional knowledge and practices for ensuring good quality scotch beef production.    Scotch beef requires full rearing and production in Scotland, which may become more difficult if costs become too high or more competitive elsewhere. Scotch beef is highly reputatble across the world however this may change in the future, especially if there is an outbreak of disease i.e. Bovine TB/ foot and mouth etc. Impacts from climate change may change the land characteristics of the area, meaning that the scotch beef are unable to be reared in areas such as Skye and Lochalsh. Also there is potential for over grazing of areas t

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2970 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and mentions a PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) product called Scotch beef. It's awarded this status if produced in Scotland, from cattle reared, slaughtered, and dressed there. There are discussions about environmental schemes, common grazing, and creating a local abattoir to shorten supply chains.

It also mentions natural assets related to maintaining the landscape suitable for Scotch beef production. Social assets include strong relationships throughout the value chain, especially among cattle farmers who use upland common grazing. There's a mention of a monitor farm project in Skye and Lochalsh that strengthened these ties. Cultural assets involve traditional knowledge and practices for quality beef.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any reference to sheep or wool production. The focus is entirely on beef, specifically Scotch beef, its production methods, supply chain considerations, environmental impacts, and the importance of social and cultural aspects related to cattle farming. There's no mention of sheep being part of the value chain, whether for meat, milk, or wool.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't involve sheep or wool production, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2757 involves using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic with a card ID VC 02 CZ. It talks about farms involved in cattle breeding, husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. They use organic farming methods and process beef, selling either through their own channels or other distribution networks. The natural assets include both natural and cultural aspects, and it's noted that the VCs likely span across country borders, similar to examples in Germany and Austria.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or wool production. The narrative focuses on cattle breeding and beef processing. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain. It doesn't talk about wool at all, only about beef and organic farming practices related to cattle. So, based on the information given, it seems like sheep aren't involved here.

Therefore, since there's no mention of sheep or wool production in the narrative, I should return an empty JSON object.

The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Tévenon. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 1.43.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep for wool production. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the VC (Value Chain) is composed of farms producing, processing, and selling resources directly on the farm. It also talks about external and local inputs for coloring and flavoring. 

Next, it references the Jura mountain chain and the Tévenon region. The landscape description includes limestone rocks, shallow valleys, high plateaus, forests, and wooded pastures. Agricultural resources here are milk and cheese production, which suggests dairy farming is prominent.

The narrative also mentions clock-making by farmers since the Middle Ages as a cultural heritage but doesn't link it to sheep or wool. It goes on with various statistics about the area's size, altitude, population, income levels, etc., but none of these directly relate to sheep or wool production.

I'm looking for any mention of sheep, wool, textiles, or related terms. The narrative focuses on milk and cheese, which are dairy products, not wool. Even though there are wooded pastures, which could imply grazing areas, the specific use of sheep for their wool isn't indicated here.

So, after reviewing all the content, I don't find any evidence that the mountain value chain in question uses sheep to produce wool. The primary agricultural focus seems to be on dairy products rather than fiber or textiles.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 AT. The cooperative provides an income basis for the mountain farmers which is also of importance regarding the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape, which has value for to
gation of the summer grazing period. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Bio vom Berg exists since 2002 as a brand of the BioAlpin cooperative. This cooperative allows democratic decision making, coordination of the production and the development of new products in order to secure the income of the farmers. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is of special interest because of it s actors structure and governance of these structure. However, it doesn t meet the criteria in regard to the mountain landscapes system. That s why data in section 3 are provided at NUTS-2 level, since this VC also extends the boundaries of a NUTS-3 region. Interactions (positive and negative impact) with the SES are thus provided as general information.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2724 is involved in using sheep to produce wool. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the cooperative provides an income basis for mountain farmers and talks about the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape during the summer grazing period. It also notes that the VC (Value Chain) involves land use systems like cropland, grassland, forestry, natural land, and pasture farming. The local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

However, when I look for specific mentions related to sheep or wool production, there's nothing directly stated. The narrative discusses challenges, innovations in products, processes, marketing, and governance but doesn't specify that sheep are part of the value chain or that wool is a product they produce.

So, based on the information given, there's no indication that this mountain value chain uses sheep for wool production.

There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and social.   Vacherin cheese is also produced in France but it does not labelles with the same PDO and does not follow the same recipe.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep for wool production. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the VC (Value Chain) is in Switzerland 2, with a reference card ID of VC43 CH2. It's made up of 11 manufacturers and ripeners along with milk producers from the Jura mountain areas. The focus seems to be on milk processing and local sales.

The challenges mentioned are related to climate change affecting fodder availability, death of spruce trees, changing landscapes, and shade. There's also uncertainty about how grassland production and animal health might be impacted—like reduced grass growth in summer but a longer growing season.

Looking at the types involved: it's classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation. The land use systems are Grassland and Forestry, and local assets include Natural and social aspects. It also mentions Vacherin cheese being produced in France but not under the same PDO or recipe.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention sheep specifically. They talk about milk producers, which could be cows since Switzerland is known for dairy products like cheese and milk. There's no reference to wool production or sheep farming. The challenges are more about fodder and grassland, which again points towards ruminants like cows rather than sheep.

So, based on the information given, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce wool. They're focused on dairy products and dealing with climate impacts on their milk production.
