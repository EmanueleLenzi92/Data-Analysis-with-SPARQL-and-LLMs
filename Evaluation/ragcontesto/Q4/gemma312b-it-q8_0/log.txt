Sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia. The sheep wool is a by-product of sheep breeding. During the last decades, wool was not processed. It was a dangerous waste, possible to destroy only in rendering plants. The shepherds must pay for the destruction of wool. Thus, any solution for wool processing means an innovation (or retro-innovation) in Slovakia. Recently, some processors in Slovakia started to focus on manual wool processing as an innovation of traditions. The national policy also promised to assist farmers with wool sales and industrial processing. New products from otherwise hazarduous waste material (retro innovation). There are also sheep wool processing workshops. Today, people are returning to old crafts, including the traditional processing of sheep's wool.

Often, the income from the wool sale does not even cover the cost of shearing sheep. Thus, the wool ends up in rendering plants buried or burned. Only a tiny percentage of it is sold - primarily for foreign markets. A significant drop in prices was caused by cheap sheep wool imported from abroad. 2) Currently, there is not industrial wool processor in Slovakia. Overall

Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric. Different Burel Products such as wall panels, carpets, curtains, cushion covers, poufs and benches, suitcases, backpacks, footwear and clothing items are produced and then sold locally, nationally and internationally.

this VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). The sheep plays a crucial role for the mountain farming in this region. Additionally, the maintainance of pasture farming is also important for the maintainance of the cultural landscapes which is important for hiking tourism. To secure the income the Genussregion and the marketing as a local speciality plays an important role for this VC.   Sheep farming has a tradition for centuries in this region. The shift to meat production in the 1950s was necessary to find new marketing opportunities. The cultural landscapes is important for the marketing strategy also the cultivated traditional sheep breeds.    The region is situated within the highest mountains of Austria and the topography of the mountains doesn t allow many practices. Sheep farming therefore is one of the few income possibilities for the mountain farmers. Climate change affects this region in regard to biodiversity loss and neophytes as well as a changing water balance. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The knowledge regarding the husbandry is considered to be traditional - also the cultivated races. The marketing as local speciality can be characterized as innovative.

The VCs spans over all important activities - from breeding, husbandry, processing food and products t
 sheep products (namely meat and wool). Farms are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products.   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The sheep farms and their products are highly attractive for tourists. Some of them offer also services in agro-tourism.    The VC is firmy embedded and the region and relies on local resources. Sheep farms are important providers of ecosystem services. (1) The VC faces economic challenges, the farms rely on agricultural subsidies. (2) The VCs is also vulnerable due to the ongoing climate changes. Dry seasons result in shortage of water that reduce availability of grass (hay). These changes may threaten farms with large herds that may not be able to secure enoough feedstuff for the sheep. (3) Farms are often located in nature protected areas (or nearby). There areas are also a home for some predators, such as wolves, that have ben re-introduced by humans. The predators are protected, however, they often cause damages to sheep farms. A present challenge is thus finding a balance between the environmental and economics interests that would enable to purseue the goals of the both sides. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This

The VC is well established and structured by farmers unions (Syndicat Caprin, Syndicat AOP Picodon.) and dairy cooperatives. It can be either marketed in long distribution channel or local market. In fact, one can find a great diversity of producing practices: organic and farmer Picodon or convention dairy picodon production. In 2017 the marketed production was 532 tons, or nearly 9,000,000 picodons, of which nearly 1,600,000 were produced by the appellation's farm producers and sold at the region's markets. Pastoralism practices are very well developped in the territority, namely by farme Picodon producers, but suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, pasture's impact on biodiversity.

The future success of the rewilding will depend on local as well as national support and acceptance of this switch. It is unclear from desktop research how much cultural (local) knowledge is involved, with many partners in the rewilding effort coming from elsewhere in the UK or even internationally.    Rewilding is very contentious in Scotland (for example the Nature Agency does not use the term). It's proponents critique traditional approaches to upland land management as damaging to Nature, and increases in native (or reintroduced) species e.g. boar, golden eagles, beavers can create damage to livestock or pasture; whilst trees decrease grazing available to wild game (deer, grouse). Much rewilding is associated with public funding or public donations (NGOs) or wealthy philantrophists; and investments are often tied to predicted returns from carbon markets or wildlife tourism, which are relatively high-risk long term investments.

Whilst rewilding is not 'new' (Alladale Estate in Sutherland started in 2003), it has become much more prominent with the increased focus on resolving the climate and bio diversity crises; and there have been several recen

They have a close partnership at eye level with the Tyrolian supermarket chain M-Preis that also invest in product development of BioAlpin.   On the one side the cooperative BioAlpin helps that farmers from the cooperative having a better income and improved marketing options. On the other side the landscape and the small size of mountain farms is an important asset for BioAlpin to promote regional, organic products in Tyrol. The cooperation among farmers as well as the cooperation with M-Preis at eye-level allows knowledge transfer and innovation. Traditional knowledge as well as innovation plays a crucial role for BioAlpin.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce the cooperative gives them a structure for a better marketing and income.

ural Heritage of Humanity. Numerous national and international initiatives aim to maintain and renew this practice as an appropriate strategy for livestock management and natural ecosystems, testing innovative management alternatives, diversifying new complementary activities and articulating a widespread social and cultural support movement.   Following the centuries-old practice of livestock transhumance (sheeps, goats and cows), in November the herds that have spent the summer in the highlands of the Natural Park of the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in Jaén and Castril in Granada, make their particular journey through the province of Jaén, towards the lowlands of Sierra Morena to spend the winter. With this extensive practice, a single herd combines the management of two farms of high environmental value.    Transhumance must overcome the state of occupation and abandonment of livestock trails and infrastructures, as well as the difficulty of living in places with basic living conditions. The aging of transhumance shepherds and the lack of a public strategy to support extensive livestock farming add to the difficulties of their survival.

Pirot white cheese in brine produced in Pirot/Old Mountain area can be made of sheep, cow and mixed milk. Sheep and mixed cheeses are with higher reputation amongst customers. Sheep and mixed cheese is made during the milking sheep season (April-October), when sheep are usually living in the mountains (bacija - summer place for sheep, usually also joint herds form several farmers). Sheep and cow milk is of high quality, due to very good quality animal grazing on natural pastures of high quality (big variety of plant species). Cheese is produced out of pasteurised milk, and after curdling milk, and producing fresh cheese, the cheese is pressed and put in brine to mature for 20-30 days. This cheese can be kept in original package in brine for several months. The cheese is sold directly to the customers, to restaurants and to the delicatessen stores, if the farm is registered for cheese production.

lue of the region contributes to valorization of these food products. Sheep husbandry bring many positive effects in term of ecology, since the farms often employ specific grazing managements.   VC directly utilizes natural assets of the given locality (grassland, high nature value farming areas). Sheep are capable of using grassland in areas that may not be used by other ruminants (cattle, goats). At the same time farms located in mountain region also utilize the symbolic value of the territory. The mountains are associted with 'purity' and 'nature' and this association is typically used in the promotion of the food products from the given VC.    The sheep dairy products create unique niche market. The assets are very specific. Main challenge for the farms is associated with succesful marketing of the products. The farms are located in remote areas, but they need to sell their products to urban consumers, who are willing to pay for the premiums. Another challange is associated with economic pressure.

Sheep are grazed in natural pastures with many medical herbs are also growing / grazing is a dominant feeding system for sheep, therefore, meat is of a very high quality. Strong winters and winds that are present in the area create specific conditions for meat drying and preservation by cold smoking. During 2020 some e-commerce started on national level where producers from Sjenica got a lot of customers. Still, this needs to be developed and better organised (now it is relying on individual transportation means and logistics of the producers/farmers. There are specialised delicatessen stores in Belgrade and bigger cities that started to buy produce directly from producers. Sjenica dry meat need better marketing strategies and governance of the VC in order to be more present in the niche markets and create demand for this high quality product. The reputation of the product is high, but the form of selling the product (the whole or half dried sheep is a piece) makes marketing more complex. There is a potential to increase demand in retail stores. The area of Pester is already well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products.

Products such as Pirot kackavalj (yellow mixed or sheep cheese) and Pirot lamb are hightly valued and recognized, and protected as PDO. However the region is under many threats from depopulation and economic deprivation to pressures from tourism and environmental degradation. The Pirot cheese PDO doesnt live to its potential of bringing benefits to producers which are often invisible. The pastoral lifestyle is becoming rare.   The natural properties of Stara planina natural park and its slopes and vicinity are initial condition for high quality product.

Social and cultural aspects are also strong, with particular equipemtn (weaving basket) used for cheese production. That made the whole cheese making skill part of the Serbian immaterial cultural heritage.    Depopulation and change of lifestyle from pasture grazing system to stationary are the main reasons for decline in number of sheep and milk shortage.

 value to the milk producing sector in the area; cooperation with the tourist sector is of mutual benefit; cooperation with other local Almenland producers: the company's online marketing platform does not only sell the cheese, but various (nearly all) other Almenland products.    As the cheese production relies exclusively on milk from the Almenland, challenges in milk production also affect this initiative. Predicted changes in climate (extreme weather conditions: drought, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth. Another challenge refers to upscaling: the quantity of production is limited, while at the same time the demand is increasing also internationally.

Whilst local sheep production remains a reliable source of wool, the local kilim industry has declined in recent years because of the loss of important markets - especially the lucrative, but very competitive, international market.

Within Perth and Kinross Atholl estate (www.atholl-estates.co.uk) undertake 3-yearly cycle of surveys aiming for measurable improvement in habitat quality. They use drones/ thermal imaging/ camera traps to count dear numbers. To ensure 'good' hunting practices, Blair Atholl and Glen Lyon estate use innovative methods for counting deer numbers to ensure that population numbers maintain healthy numbers. Use of a range of innvoative counting mechanisms. Such mechanisms can also be used to explore the level of conflict between deer and hikers, sheep numbers, other bird poulation numbers.   Natural assets: relies on wild (but managed) land to ensure there is a hospitable environment for the deer and grouse. Also, this land contributes to nice and attractive scenery for stalking visitors. Social assets: relies on good relations with the local communities living and working near and in these stalking estates (i.e., for tourist accomodation), with hikers and wildlfie conservation organsiations. In terms of cultural assets, sporting game relies on traditional and local knowledge for stalking practices, processes and habitat management.

Strong connection to the cultural and national heritage. High level of entrepreneurial spirit reputation of healthy area, food and hospitality. Specific grazing systems (Highland mountains grazing systems - nomadic). Emerging small and middle size farms are registering processing due to new regulation that are set for small farms and processing units.    Farm gate prices of sheep were very low in 2020, due to the lock down in the season of sheep selling. Many farmers sold parts of their herds, and had problems with feeding of animals due to dry season and heavy rains in the summer. Ecosystems are endangered by pollution and climate change. Family farming is endangered, and their sustainability is fragile. Few farmers sell to the known buyers, there are many 'middle men' that come and buy animals at very low prices. Special nature reserve area is endagered too, together with the grazing system for cattle and sheep.

inatin fish stocks).   Natural - importance of maintaining scenery for nice surroundings for fly fishing, maintaining quality of river catchment so fish stocks remain high. Social - good relations with communities and lacndowners for welcoming (and allowing access) tourists and sharing rivers with locals (and vice versa). Cultural - relies of traditional fly fishing methods and good local knowledge of good areas for salmon catches.    Activities on the upper levels of the rivers/ lochs can impact on the populations of salmon lower down (and then have a knock on economic impact). This could include chnages to the river course becuase of flooing/ potential flooding. If numbers of permits were to increase this may reduce the likelihoods of successful catches and again have a knock on economic impact. Less tourist numbers visiting due to COVID-19/ Brexit.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 UK. The distinctive and dramatic North-West Highland landscape is based on the contrast and vicinity of the mountains to the coast. Wildlife tourism in the area also benefits from this proximity, often combining opportunities to see marine, coastal, and mountain species. Tour operators include national companies and local guides who offer flexible and bespoke tours. Wildlife tourism in the wider Scottish Highlands was estimatled to be worth £124 million in 2010. Local markets for wildlife and birdwatching also presents opportunities relating to physical and mental well-being. However, there are difficulties in defining this value chain, in terms of it's distinctness from other forms of countryside tourism, and the national/regional tourism 'product', whichs build on iconography of key species in branding and characterisation of the Highlands in terms of wildness. Non-specific/informal wildlife and nature tourism experiences are contributory in tourism motivations and satisfaction (generating return visits).

ity. Highland Cattle as a cultural icon is an innovative new 'product' to be produced from Highland Cattle. They offer an additional attraction to Scottish Highland and Island areas and often are located next to Whisky distilleries or forest parks etc, to offer an additional local attraction. They are also now widely used in marketing processes (i.e. through Visit Scotland, Highland Cow Safaris etc.) as a way to attract new visitors to Scotland.   They can happily live on the poor mountainous terrain throughout Lochaber LAU1, and they are also able to assist with conservation of the area (butterflies and wildfloers). They also add to the scenery of the area due to their attractvie and iconic status. They are an important cultural asset as they help create a cultural link between Scotland and its land. They have also been breed and kept in Scotland for centuries, relying on local and traditional knowledge. In terms of social assets, having highland cows in an area necessitates good relations with the land/ highland cattle owner and the local community and tourism ventures to ensure that the draw of tourists to an area to see the highland cattle is a positive experience for all involved.

In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The producers of the meat products use these images in names of their producst and description. In this way they valorize symbolic resources of the given mountain region.    Main challenges are associated with (1) marketing of the products and (2) hygienic rules that require very high investment costs.

6.24%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 72.49%.   The main activity is the breeding of Limousine beef cattle, a species native to the French Massif Central, and introduced since the 1970s in the valley with the aim of recovering and enhancing the pastures and marginal areas. it also participates in the recovery of ottofile corn, an old variety of corn, once widespread but then progressively marginalized and abandoned in favor of more productive and profitable varieties. The innovation start to spread also in this very traditional value chain.   The farm pursues the development model of 'ethical agriculture', according to which the company also assumes a role for the growth of its territory: from an environmental, landscape, social and cultural point of view; also paying particular attention to the relationship with the consumer and the psycho-physical well-being of the animals. In fact, these cows live free on pasture from May to October, while for the remainder of the year they live in the large farm center feeding on hay from local fields, integrated with a mixture of cereals grown on the farm.

, exogenous breeds slaughtered younger (8-10 months) etc.). These product are made by small-scale on-farm processors from local pigs (nustrale breed), reared in extensive conditions with chestnuts and acorns. The 3 PDOs are exemplary of the association of domestic animal and plant biodiversity (spontaneous and cultivated resources) and traditional knowledge (processing and tasting). The interest is linked to the coupling between the different human and non-human components on which the market and environmental value is based.   The value chain is linked to an organized association of different components. The challenge is to maintain the coupling of farming, processing and reputation of the products and managing the resources of the environment, in particular the chestnut grove and oak trees. And to succeed in the use of collective resources such as the chestnut or oak grove. Chestnut is struck by the cynips disease and threatened with degeneration (old orchards). How to constitute a common chestnut groves between harvest and breeding?. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 UK. Highland Spring and Tesco perthsire mineral waters (still and sparkling) depend on extracting spring/ground water from the protected catchment sources in the Ochil Hills and bottling them at their plants for distribution to supermarkets and restaurants and vending machines. These catchment sources do not allow farming (but are grazed by wild deer, rabbits; habitat for bees and birds). There Ochils site (at Blackford, Perthsire) employs around 280 staff. Highland Spring is a listed company (Highland Spring Group) that has sales revenues of £110m (2018 figures) from all brands/sites. The products are transported from their sites by lorry but they are planning a new rail siding to their main bottling plant. We suspect HSG also produce the other brands (Tesco Perthshire, Aldi Strathrowan) but this is unverified. As noted above, HSG are accredited by Soil Association; Good Shopping Guide and Brand Reputation Through Compliance Global Standards; meet ISO14001 standard and approved supplier to Sustainable Restaurant Association.

the estate is part of the wider 'East West Wild' initiative (linking this LAU1 to Skye and Lochaber). Bunloit (1262 acres) is planting trees, using extensive grazing and natural regneration to increase biodiversity and reach net Zero including building eco-homes. There is also the 'Lifescape' project (100 acres) that is in the 'Highlands' near Loch Ness (location restricted to protect the rare species) which is in the area. As noted, the product (more nature) is novel, and also the processes (restoration) are often trials not used before. In both cases, the estate owners participate in national and international networks that are new. Finally, there are often academic partners undertaking RandD on these living laboratories. There is also some limited local knowledge about how the land used to be, and what works, being accessed through the citizen science, volunteering and 'building bridges' networking with local farmers. However, most expertise is exogenous to the locality.   As described above, these estates are fairly typical of upland Scottish estates - mix of forestry, semi-natural habitats and rough grazing - some designated areas under EU Natura 2000 or UK designation, sheep and cattle grazing and potentially hunting deer - but have been repurposed to reduce production of timber and meat (there is some timber/lamb production) and increase the production of public goods (regulating and cultural ecosystem services).

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 AT. Only registered animals can take part in the beef quality program approved by the Agrarmarkt Austria (AMA). The oxen come from suckler cow husbandry and are hired by the fatteners in spring and autumn (in sum there are approx. 350 small scale farms engaged). The approximately 1.000 animals slaughtered each year spend half of their life with their mother before they are fattened. It is fed with grass and maize silage and a bit grain. The oxen are slaughtered at an age of 22-24 months . The current population of Murbodner cattle in Austria is around 4,500, of which around 3,400 are dams. The oxen meat from Murbodner beef is available under the brand Landbeef Österreichisches Rindfleisch für Genießer (transl.: Landbeef Austrian beef for connoisseurs ). The meat from the Murbodner oxen is only available three to four times a year and is marketed on-farm, through regional food retailers (only in Styria and southern Burgenland) and through regional gastronomy. Young oxen from Murbodner or crossbred animals are also popular for special branded meat programs (e.g. ALMO see VC 01 AT), thus there are linkages to other high quality meat production initiatives.

The creation of a local abbatoir is also of interest to shorten the supply chains and the imapcts on the environment.   Natural assets: The importance of maintaining the landscape and land use so it suitable for scotch beef, and simultaneously these cattle and improve the natural asset. Social assets - strong relationships throughout the value chain to ensure that the PGI status is maintained and to create the local abbatoir. Also good relations amongst the cattle farmers who often rear cattle on upland common grazing (shared land for farming). Social assets have also been strengthened through the recent scotch beef monitor farm project within Skye and Lochalsh. Cultural assets are the reliance and cotinuation of traditional knowledge and practices for ensuring good quality scotch beef production.    Scotch beef requires full rearing and production in Scotland, which may become more difficult if costs become too high or more competitive elsewhere. Scotch beef is highly reputatble across the world however this may change in the future, especially if there is an outbreak of disease i.e. Bovine TB/ foot and mouth etc. Impacts from climate change may change the land characteristics of the area, meaning that the scotch beef are unable to be reared in areas such as Skye and Lochalsh.
