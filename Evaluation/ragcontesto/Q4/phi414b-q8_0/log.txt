Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric.

The narrative describes a value chain involving sheep farmers associated with the cooperative ARGE Glocknerlamm in Austria. The key product mentioned is lamb, and it highlights that sheep farming is one of the few income possibilities for mountain farmers due to the topography. While the primary focus is on lamb products, the context implies traditional sheep farming practices, which typically include wool production as part of their activities. Therefore, it can be inferred that the value chain involves using sheep to produce wool.

The narrative describes a mountain value chain in Austria where sheep play a crucial role, particularly in maintaining pasture farming and cultural landscapes important for tourism. Sheep farming has been traditional in the region, with a shift towards meat production in the 1950s. The context implies that wool could be one of the products derived from sheep, given their significant role in the value chain. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the mountain value chain involves using sheep to produce wool.

Rewilding is very contentious in Scotland (for example the Nature Agency does not use the term). It's proponents critique traditional approaches to upland land management as damaging to Nature, and increases in native (or reintroduced) species e.g. boar, golden eagles, beavers can create damage to livestock or pasture; whilst trees decrease grazing available to wild game (deer, grouse).

The narrative describes sheep breeds feeding on pastures and mentions their milk being used to produce cheese. While it does not explicitly state that wool is produced from these sheep, the involvement of sheep in a value chain typically includes wool production unless specified otherwise. Therefore, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the mountain value chain involves using sheep, which likely includes wool production as part of their use.

Pirot white cheese in brine produced in Pirot/Old Mountain area can be made of sheep, cow and mixed milk. Sheep and mixed cheeses are with higher reputation amongst customers. Sheep and mixed cheese is made during the milking sheep season (April-October), when sheep are usually living in the mountains (bacija - summer place for sheep, usually also joint herds form several farmers). Sheep and cow milk is of high quality, due to very good quality animal grazing on natural pastures of high quality (big variety of plant species). Cheese is produced out of pasteurised milk, and after curdling milk, and producing fresh cheese, the cheese is pressed and put in brine to mature for 20-30 days. This cheese can be kept in original package in brine for several months. The cheese is sold directly to the customers, to restaurants and to the delicatessen stores, if the farm is registered for cheese production.

Relies on strong export market which could be imapcted by BREXIT/ COVID. Farmed venison takes two years to make a return on investment meaning is a difficult business to start. Overgrazing or overculling may be other challenges. Challenges related to climate change may mean the deer framing/ production could become too costly or the terrain/ climate may no longer be suitable. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. venison production is traditional, but production as charcuterie is innovative. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and other (for farmed deer). The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Wild and farmed venison is common across Scotland (i.e. Badenoch and Strathspey) and also links to the VC for game hunting. Farmed venison is also found within Newy and Mourne (LAU1 in Northern Ireland).

A combination of assets are used: the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) plus the cultural heritage of the Kilim weaving tradition.    Whilst local sheep production remains a reliable source of wool, the local kilim industry has declined in recent years because of the loss of important markets - especially the lucrative, but very competitive, international market. Consequently the town and municipality have above average levels of unemployment with associated population loss and on-going demographic decline. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.

The narrative describes a value chain involving sheep on the plateaus and pastures of Erzincan, where cheese is produced from the milk of White Karaman sheep. This indicates that sheep are used in this value chain, specifically for producing cheese, which implies wool production as well since sheep are typically raised for both meat (cheese) and wool. Therefore, the narrative involves using sheep to produce wool.

rn of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    For very traditional products, like 'Sirene' cheese, that are produced by small-scale farmers the main challenge is how to 'add value' to the product in order to increase farm / household income. This is a particular problem in locations such as Chiprovtsi Municipality where a) infrastucture is poor and the opportunity to regularly visit organised farmers' markets in the main cities is very limited; b) there is a lack of commercial processing units to produce higher quality products; c) knowledge of direct marketing is limited, and; d) there is no regional brand - or 'mountain products' brand (see below).

Only registered animals can take part in the beef quality program approved by the Agrarmarkt Austria (AMA). The oxen come from suckler cow husbandry and are hired by the fatteners in spring and autumn (in sum there are approx. 350 small scale farms engaged). The approximately 1.000 animals slaughtered each year spend half of their life with their mother before they are fattened. It is fed with grass and maize silage and a bit grain. The oxen are slaughtered at an age of 22-24 months . The current population of Murbodner cattle in Austria is around 4,500, of which around 3,400 are dams. The oxen meat from Murbodner beef is available under the brand Landbeef Österreichisches Rindfleisch für Genießer (transl.: Landbeef Austrian beef for connoisseurs ). The meat from the Murbodner oxen is only available three to four times a year and is marketed on-farm, through regional food retailers (only in Styria and southern Burgenland) and through regional gastronomy.

Natural assets: The importance of maintaining the landscape and land use so it suitable for scotch beef, and simultaneously these cattle and improve the natural asset. Social assets - strong relationships throughout the value chain to ensure that the PGI status is maintained and to create the local abbatoir. Also good relations amongst the cattle farmers who often rear cattle on upland common grazing (shared land for farming). Social assets have also been strengthened through the recent scotch beef monitor farm project within Skye and Lochalsh. Cultural assets are the reliance and cotinuation of traditional knowledge and practices for ensuring good quality scotch beef production.    Scotch beef requires full rearing and production in Scotland, which may become more difficult if costs become too high or more competitive elsewhere. Scotch beef is highly reputatble across the world however this may change in the future, especially if there is an outbreak of disease i.e. Bovine TB/ foot and mouth etc. Impacts from climate change may change the land characteristics of the area, meaning that the scotch beef are unable to be reared in areas such as Skye and Lochalsh.
