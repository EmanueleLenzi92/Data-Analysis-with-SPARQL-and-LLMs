The area is well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products. Sheep meat has very strong reputation in the country, as well as abroad (region and traditional markets / Muslim countries). There are potentials to protect PDO product at the EU level and have direct export with the label. Adding value to the products by certifying organic production, and/or other certificates that are in line with nature protection are of a great potential. Additionally, connecting the products with sustainable tourism (rural tourism) and other channels for selling these products (e-commerce) creates potential for avoiding low prices and selling animals. Reopening of export to countries asking for halal meat (Middle East, Turkey, etc.) is slowly increasing.

Zavot cow s milk is used in the production. The quality of the cheese is dependent on altitude, pasture-based animal farming and the traditional production process. Kars kashar has a Geographical Indication from Turkish Patent and Trademark Office. The first cheese museum was established in Boğatepe.    Immigration is a problem for the region. But depending on the economic development of the village, remigration has started to Boğatepe in recent years. It is important to increase the production and promotion of gruyere and kashar cheeses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current.

'Telemea' is a salted white cheese most commonly made from sheep or cows' milk, but sometimes also from goats' milk. Varying degrees of ageing. Widepread traditional mountain product in Romania. Similar to Greek 'feta'. This specific value chain is for a 'Telemea' made from cows' milk by a small-scale producer in Vaideeni commune (174021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-telemea-din-lapte-de-vaca/).   The natural asset used for producing 'Telemea' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing).    Value chains for artisanal products such as the 'Telemea' produced in the Vaideeni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality / 'counterfeit' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (

This is an important value chain for sheep farmers in the Carpathians, especially for supporting the finacial viability of many small farms and thereby ensuring their continued existence and contribution to the maintenance of the traditional farming practices that are important for biodiversity conservation and the valued mountain landscapes.   The live sheep and lambs collected from local farms for export are usually from the most two common breeds found in the Carpathians - the Tsurcana breed (a traditional indigenous breed that was favoured by Romanian transhumance shepherds and is still very popular in mountain villages) and the Tsigai breed (a more recently introduced breed that is more common in the hilly sub-mountainous areas of the Carpathians).    The live export of sheep and lambs is highly controversial because of the animal welfare issues associated with transporting live animals over long distances. This tragically was brought to the attention of the global media in November 2019 when a cargo ship carrying almost 15,000 sheep capsized in the Black Sea shortly after leaving Romania for Saudi Arabia - for more details see here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/europe/romanian-sheep-cargo-ship.html.

The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' began selling fresh (eviscerated) Rainbow Trout in 2018 and has since diversified into the processing and sale of a broad range of additional products
'catch-and-cook'). The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' is a good example of a trout farm (https://www.pastravariabusteni.ro/) located in a mountain area (the Prahova River Valley) that is popular with tourists and therefore has a thriving business in direct sales of fresh trout and trout products - all registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT).   The key natural asset for a trout farm such as this is a clean (unpolluted) source of water - in this case, a local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unsp

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms, and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff, poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines, low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition, lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment, and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.

Cheese production allows to value milk (produced in large quantities on a national scale) and maintain this landscape and its biodiversity. Gruyère production is furthermore based on traditional and historical know-how.    The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade).

The narrative describes the production of Alpine Gruyère cheese using milk from cattle, not sheep. Therefore, the mountain value chain is not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 TR. The number of farmers engaged in goat and sheep breeding in the region is 1179 and 1572, respectively. Since pasture areas are insufficient, goat and sheep breeders purchase feed from feed suppliers. However, high feed prices increase the cost of production. The most frequently used marketing channels for product sales are usually retailers, companies and traders from outside the region. In addition, it is observed that the producers make direct sales to consumers and hotels. However, direct sales are not at a high level. One of the most important problems in the value chain is the marketing of high quality products at low prices. The producers are trying to avoid this problem by selling directly. It is seen that the producers are members of the Sheep and Goat Breeders Association in Antalya. This union takes part in the implementation of animal breeding programs at the regional level to increase productivity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Bey mountains, Antalya.

The narrative mentions that there are 1572 farmers engaged in sheep breeding and discusses aspects related to sheep production, such as feed purchasing due to insufficient pasture areas. While it does not explicitly state the use of sheep for cheese production, the involvement in sheep breeding suggests a potential link to using sheep products like milk for cheese. Therefore, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the value chain could be involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The Bran area offers a significant number of attractions for tourists, but the pattern of development during the last 30 years has come to threaten its future viability and sustainability as an attractive and profitable tourist destination. Bran is very well located and easily accessible with relatively good infrastructure. It has developed as a multi-purpose recreational resource with some relatively good accomodation / restaurants combined with a proliferation of rustic-styled 'agro-touristic' farms and second homes (the majority of which are newly constructed). Consequently the traditional rural identity of the area has become lost to an 'urban-type' over-development which increasingly discourages foriegn visitors whilst still appealing to the domestic visitor.

The VC aims on production of herb liquers of various flavours. The liquers are presented as a regional product. The VC is utilizes symbolic assets of the region. Alhough this product is not unique of mountain regions, it is a great example of utilizing natural and symbolic values associated with the region. In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the liquers are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area. The symbolic value refering to the mountains is what distingusihes the product from other similar products.    Herb liquers are sold on mainstream food markets

Deer are synonymous with Scotland's mountainous areas and due to a lack of larger predators are thus managed for better land management. 50 Deer Management groups exist in Scotland made up of multiple landowners, gamekeepers etc. The venison VC interacts with the sporting game VC. New products (charcuterie meats) are created through new processes (i.e. drying and curring the venison) adopted from outside of Scotland. Furthermore, Great Glen Charcuterie use 100% venison meat (and nothing else) in their products. They also now sell their produce at delis, restaurants and farm shops across Scotland.   Natural: venison requires mountainous and 'wild' terrain for venison production as well as attractive landscape and scenery to add to the 'venison brand' (i.e. iconic views of Scotland).

n south-east Bulgaria. Tsarevo Municipality (BGS13) in Burgas Province (BG341) is one of the centres of production of this speciality honey.   The very specific natural asset used to produce Strandzhanski manov med (Manna honey) is the Natura 2000 designated oak forests of the Strandzha mountains in the south of Burgas Province. Due to their proximity to the Black, Marmara and Aegean Seas, the Strandzha mountains have relatively high air humidity and mild temperatures which, combined with the local soil conditions, creates a very specific flora in the oak forests.    As in most other countries, there is growing concern amongst Bulgarian bee-keepers about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources. The long-term effects of climate change and climate variability remain unknown but are likely to have negative impacts upon productivity of honeybees. Specific interventions are therefore needed to strengthen the capacity of beekeepers to adapt e.g. by integrating climate services with available indigenous knowledge and local practices.

Water temperature, speed and biochemical characteristics influence the fish quality. The social asset is represented in the PDO that brings producers together. Finally, the rakfish is a traditional product consumed all along Norway and the traditional fermentation method is quite unique in Europe.    In the light of climate change, this VC may face a challenge if the natural mountain water streams change their regimes as precipitations are expected to increase while snow cover period is expected to decrease.

Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric. Different Burel Products such as wall panels, carpets, curtains, cushion covers, poufs and benches, suitcases, backpacks, footwear and clothing items are produced and then sold locally, nationally and internationally.

Social assets: good relations amongst those in the VC including timber producer, land managers, bespoke carpenters and tourism busineeses. Cultural assets: traditional knowledge for traditional handcrafted timber production methods, and links to the cultural heritage of the area (i.e., knowledge of local trees and how best they can be used).    Less wood may be available for artisinal use given Scottish Government's desire to have more of the land covered in forestry (and reduce climate change impacts) in the future (21% forestry cover by 2032).

 landscape. Olives are the primary crop. The cultivation of Aloe Vera has highly influenced production and distribution and brought on technological developments in manufacturing methods. Aloe Vera is a supplementary income for farmers. Moreover, processing facilities focused on the food/cosmetic industries developed quickly in the past 5 years offering employment opportunities and sustaining the population in these areas. Cultivation of Aloe vera has proven to be economically viable and e-commerce and export pathways that are being further established. Challenges include risk of extinction of rare plants of the local flora which are endemic to the Dikti area and Viannos. Another challenge is that only a few leaf-processing units exist in the area which can contribute to a problematic supply chain. Quality checks are costly and hence may not be sufficient in number. Moreover, fluctuating quality of production has been reported leading to risk of reduced harvests. Adulteration of the final products is another conrern and risk. In Viannos, Aloe Vera is cultivated in great quantities and that helps the young people to stay in the rural areas of the region. Competition of land use and the implementation of ambivalent investment programms are also pressing concerns in the region.

The consumers can visit the webpage and check meat availability, choose meat type, locality and order the products online. Second, the Slovak governement implemented a project entitled 'Delicatess from the forest' with aim to promote game meat from the Slovak forests available on a domestic market and support collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Hunting is an important activity in Slovak mountain areas. The VC is a good example of market adaptation to the restrictions during a pandemic situation.   Natural assets are forests with wild game. Social asset is a collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Cultural asset is a tradition of hunting in Slovak mountains.    1) Pandemic situation causes problems to game supplies. Retail chains require relatively large quantities of the same type of meat in a short time. As the game can only be hunted to a limited extent for pandemic measures, it isn't easy to ensure a sufficient amount of game and logistics to retail chains. 2) The government's implemented project is only temporal, and a long-term strategy to increase the amount of game
