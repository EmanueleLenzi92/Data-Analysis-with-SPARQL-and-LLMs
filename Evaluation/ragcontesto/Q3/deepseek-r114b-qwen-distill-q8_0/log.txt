Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3156 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Turkey and the VC ID is VC09 TR. It talks about feeding and milking activities done by small family farms, specifically involving sheep and goats. Then it says some breeders make cheese using dried goat or sheep skin. That's interesting because it directly connects sheep to cheese production.

Further down, it mentions that cheese made from goat and sheep milk is included in other MRLs in countries like Serbia, Spain, Switzerland. It also specifies that Izmir tulum cheese is a special kind made by placing the cheese into handmade dried goat or sheep skin. This again ties sheep directly into the cheese-making process.

So putting it all together, the narrative clearly states that sheep are involved in producing cheese through their milk and even using their skin in the production method. Therefore, the mountain value chain here is indeed involved in using sheep for cheese production.

 problem with finding professional shepherds; even the conditions offered are very favourable. For this reason, there is a lack of sheep milk, which is why more of cow cheese is produced. Reduction of sheep herds, which are autochthonous Pirot and Karakachan sheep, is negative for the area (grazing is reduced), as well as for loosing important genetic material of very good sheep breed (used both for meat and milk, with very high reputation). Demographics of the area is also very negative, many villages are with only few old people still living there, while young people move to Pirot and/or bigger Serbian cities.

The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Pirot white cheese is mostly produced in small processing on-farm units. There is a Dairy school in the city of Pirot, which is one of the few bigger producers of the white cheese in brine and Pirot hard cheese. This school is good tradition keeper, but in the same time, trying to introduce new ways of cheese marketing and promotion.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3001 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the Moving reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID VC 11 SER. It talks about Pirot white cheese produced in the Pirot/Old Mountain area. The key point here is that this cheese can be made from sheep milk, cow milk, or a mix of both. Specifically, it says that sheep and mixed cheeses have higher reputation among customers.

So, right away, I see that sheep are involved because the cheese is made using sheep milk. Even though they also use cow and mixed milk, the presence of sheep milk in production means the value chain does involve sheep for cheese making.

The narrative goes on to discuss challenges like a lack of professional shepherds and issues with finding enough sheep milk, which leads to more cow cheese being produced. It mentions that the reduction in sheep herds affects the local area both environmentally and genetically, as these sheep are important for their meat and milk.

Additionally, it talks about the type of cheese production—mostly small on-farm units—and mentions a dairy school involved in producing Pirot white cheese and hard cheese. The focus is on traditional methods with some innovative approaches, like online marketing.

Putting this all together, since the cheese is explicitly made from sheep milk (among other sources), the mountain value chain here does use sheep to produce cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. It also notes the reference card ID as VC 50 IT. The farm has 35 cows, specifically Grigio Alpina and Original Brouw breeds. Their main product is 'Formai de Ceresegn' cheese, which ages for one to ment/year—though I'm not sure what "ment" stands for here; maybe it's a typo or specific term.

The cheese is described as excellent from both gustatory and nutritional perspectives, rich in proteins, phosphorus, calcium, vitamins A and B2. It mentions that innovation is starting to spread in this traditional value chain. Key assets include grasslands and meadows in the Alps, along with traditional dairy knowledge.

It also talks about cheese and butter from mountains having superior nutrition because the animals eat pasture herbs rich in bioactive compounds. The challenges are current, it's a traditional VC, and innovation is related to the whole chain but unspecified. Land use systems involve grassland and natural land, with local assets being natural.

Now, looking for sheep: the narrative mentions cows—Grigio Alpina and Original Brouw breeds. There's no mention of sheep at all in the text. The cheese production comes from cows' milk since they have 35 cows in production. Sheep aren't referenced as part of the value chain here.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain isn't involved with using sheep to produce cheese; it's focused on cows.
</think>

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep for cheese production; it focuses on cows.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Turkey is the reference member state and the VC ID is VC 18 TR. It talks about small family farms handling feeding and milking of sheep and goats. Cheese ripening is done in dried goat or sheep skin, which sounds unique and traditional. 

It also mentions that cheese made from goat and sheep milk is included in other MRLs in Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, and specifically highlights Bergama tulum cheese as a special kind made by placing into handmade dried goat or sheep skin.

So, the key points are:
1. Sheep and goats are involved in feeding and milking.
2. Cheese production uses their milk.
3. The traditional method involves using animal skins for ripening.

Therefore, yes, the value chain is involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative mentions that there are three cheese producers in Nivegy-valley micro-region. They produce high-quality artisanal cheeses and milk products. It says they keep animals, specifically goats and cows. Nowhere does it mention sheep being part of their livestock or used in the production process.

I should also check if any other parts of the narrative hint at using sheep indirectly. The challenges faced include climate change and urbanization pressures, but these don't relate to animal types. There's a mention of traditional peasent families, but again, no indication that they use sheep for cheese.

Since the only animals mentioned are goats and cows, it seems clear that sheep aren't involved in this value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3142 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) that includes 11 manufacturers and ripeners along with milk producers from the Jura mountain areas. It mentions that the milk is processed and sold locally, primarily in large Swiss supermarkets. The challenges they face include increasing droughts due to climate change, which affects fodder availability and spruce trees in pastures. There's also uncertainty about how climate change impacts grassland production and animal health.

The VC is classified as Traditional, but it doesn't specify the type of innovation involved. The land use systems are Grassland and Forestry, with local assets being Natural and social. It also mentions that Vacherin cheese is produced in France but under a different PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and recipe.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used in this value chain for producing cheese. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep; instead, it refers to milk producers from the Jura mountains. Typically, Vacherin cheese is made from cow's milk, not sheep's milk. However, without explicit information about the animals used, I can't assume they're using sheep.

Since there's no direct mention of sheep in the production process, I should conclude that the value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2760 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let's read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, with a card ID VC 05 CZ. It talks about farms involved in sheep breeding, husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. They often use organic farming methods. So far, sheep are definitely part of this value chain.

Next, it says that these farms process their own "lue" which I think might be a typo for "milk." Processing milk would make sense if they're making cheese. The narrative also mentions that the sheep dairy products create a unique niche market. That's a strong indicator that cheese is being produced from sheep's milk.

Additionally, it discusses how the symbolic value of the mountains is used to promote their food products. This often ties into branding for cheeses and other dairy products, emphasizing natural and pure origins.

The challenges mentioned include marketing to urban consumers who are willing to pay premiums, which aligns with specialty cheeses like sheep's milk cheese. They also rely on direct payments because their farming supports ecosystem services, which is common in sustainable or organic dairy operations.

Putting it all together: the narrative explicitly mentions sheep breeding and processing for dairy products, specifically noting sheep dairy products as a niche market. Therefore, this value chain does use sheep to produce cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is NMK with a specific card ID. It lists key actors involved in cheese production: Maleshevo milk Berovo, Mlekara Malesh, Mlekara Natasha, and Farma Pacarski. These are all dairy-related businesses, which suggests they're involved in cheese production.

Next, it talks about the economic sectors in the region. The tertiary sector has a high employment share, but more importantly, agriculture is a basic activity, with sheep breeding being traditional. It specifically mentions that Berovo cheese is recognized for its quality both locally and beyond. This directly ties sheep to cheese production since sheep are commonly used for milk in cheese-making.

The narrative also points out that the number of sheep is decreasing, which is a problem because it affects the industry. They mention challenges like finding shepherds and market consolidation issues, indicating that sheep are integral to their operations. The fact that there's high demand for Maleshevski cheese further supports that they're producing cheese from sheep.

Additionally, the value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with innovations in new products and processes. This implies they might be using modern methods but still rely on traditional practices like sheep breeding for milk.

Putting it all together, the narrative explicitly connects sheep breeding to cheese production, especially Berovo cheese. Therefore, the mountain value chain does use sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2993 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that there are several operators registered, mostly small homemade processing workshops. It talks about the decline in the number of sheep due to depopulation and lifestyle changes from pasture grazing to stationary systems. The current sheep count is 13760, which seems low, leading to milk shortages. 

It also discusses challenges like resource management issues and threats from investments in small hydro power plants affecting water resources and landscapes. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovations. Traditional processes have been modernized, including new machinery designs for processing. There's mention of local festivals reviving forgotten products, leading to commercial production and efforts to protect the geographical name with alterations in packaging, meat mixtures (including sheep), and spices.

From this, I can infer that sheep are part of the production process since they're mentioned as a source of milk and meat. The processing workshops likely use sheep's milk for cheese production, given the context of dairy products and the decline in milk supply affecting production. Additionally, the mention of "meat mixture (goat, sheep, cow or donkey)" suggests that sheep are used in their products, possibly including cheese.

Therefore, the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative mentions extensive sheep farming and pastoralism in the Drôme valley. It talks about local slaughtering and direct sales, but it doesn't explicitly say they're making cheese from the sheep's milk. Instead, it refers to producing organic sheep meat and mentions ecosystem services like silvopastoralism. There's also a focus on governance systems and marketing strategies for local products.

I don't see any specific mention of cheese production here. The emphasis is more on meat and sustainable practices rather than dairy products. So, based on the information given, it doesn't seem like this value chain uses sheep for cheese.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID is 3130, so that's important for the output. The narrative mentions that the value chain includes a family farm producing yogurt directly on the farm and selling it locally. They also sell to cheese dairies. 

Now, looking at the products: they're labeled 'IP S' which I think stands for something like "Integrated Production Switzerland," but more importantly, the milk used is from goats. The challenges mentioned are related to climate change affecting grasslands and fodder, impacting the farm's operations.

Wait a minute, the narrative says they produce yogurt on the farm and sell it directly, as well as to cheese dairies. But does it mention cheese specifically? It talks about cheese dairies but doesn't specify if the farm itself is producing cheese or just selling milk to them. The main product mentioned is yogurt made from goat's milk.

Sheep are not mentioned anywhere in this narrative. They're talking about goats, which are different animals. So, even though they're involved in dairy production and selling to cheese dairies, the specific use of sheep isn't indicated here.

Therefore, since there's no mention of sheep being used for producing cheese in this value chain, I shouldn't include the ID in the JSON. Instead, I'll output an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Spain UCO and the reference card ID is VC 14 ES. It talks about goats sleeping and grazing on the same farm where cheese production happens. The goats are milked daily, and their milk goes to a lab. 

It mentions high-quality goat cheese from the Florida Andaluza breed, which has grazed these pastures for centuries. There's some discussion about challenges like the scarcity of herds, competition with industrial cheese, and expanding sales beyond the province.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with exogenous innovation related to energy use and waste management. They use solar energy and treat wastewater in an artificial pond for their garden. The land use systems are grassland and animal skin/leather, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Another cheese producer in Sierra Morena is mentioned, 'Besos y Quesos,' which uses goats of the Malagueña breed.

Nowhere in this narrative do they mention sheep. It's all about goats—milked goats, goat cheese production, specific breeds of goats. So, it seems like the value chain here is focused on goats, not sheep.

The mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep to produce cheese; it focuses solely on goats.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is NMK, with a specific card ID. It says that private owners are breeding sheep and selling lambs collectively. The reference mountain chain is Mountain Meleshevija. 

It's classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation type isn't specified, but it mentions new technology used in processing lamb meat and distribution channels for foreign markets. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, the key point is whether sheep are used to produce cheese. The narrative talks about breeding sheep and selling lambs, which suggests that the primary product here is lamb meat. There's no mention of dairy products or cheese production. Cheese typically comes from milk, but since the focus is on lamb meat processing, it seems like they're not producing cheese.

Therefore, I don't see any indication in the narrative that sheep are used for making cheese. The value chain appears to be focused on meat rather than dairy.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

First, it mentions that the reference member state is Turkey and the Value Chain (VC) ID is VC 10 TR. The cheese production happens on the plateaus and pastures of Erzincan, where there are nearly half a million sheep. It specifically says that cheese is produced from the milk of White Karaman sheep. These sheep graze in the highlands, and small-scale breeders stay on the plateau for about five months each year.

The narrative also talks about Erzincan Tulum Cheese, which has a Geographical Indication. It's made using traditional methods and requires the milk from these White Karaman sheep. There's mention of the sheep grazing on plants in the highlands, indicating that their milk is essential for cheese production.

Additionally, it notes that cheese production is mostly done on small-scale farms with no standard method, but the key point here is the reliance on sheep's milk. The challenges mentioned relate to infrastructure and classification as a traditional value chain.

Putting this all together, the narrative explicitly states that cheese is produced from sheep's milk, specifically the White Karaman breed. Therefore, the mountain value chain in question does involve using sheep for cheese production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece and the reference card ID is VC 01 GR. It talks about the production of graviera affecting graziers in the Kalogeros area and their families. Graviera is a type of cheese, so that's relevant.

Next, it says that sheep and goat breeding keeps the traditional way in livestock on mountainous pastures. So they're definitely raising sheep and goats there. The main product mentioned is milk, which is facing disposal issues and economic problems for producers. They rely on European subsidies to survive.

It also mentions animal infections and climate change affecting pastoral activities. Young people are deterred from staying because of the hard life and economic uncertainty, leading to a declining local population. Graviera is an established high-priced cheese that could help with milk disposal but faces strong competition.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. Recently, they've introduced enriched graviera mixed with aromatic plants and spices to gain market advantage. They're also using social media more and have started using whey in animal feed.

So putting this together: the narrative clearly involves sheep (and goats) being bred for their milk, which is then used to produce cheese, specifically graviera. Therefore, the mountain value chain does use sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2798 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that Milk Kid is seasonally produced, mostly for Christmas, by about 200 farmers. It talks about an association of farmers intervening for slaughtering animals and reconnecting intertwined activities like milk lamb and dairy production. The goal seems to be reuniting these practices that were separated during modernization and specialization in agriculture.

It also mentions the challenge is current, and the VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation. Land use systems are grassland, and local assets include natural and cultural aspects. It's rare but present elsewhere in France, like the Alps and CCVD, and there's a comparison to Portugal's kid production focused on meat.

Now, looking for clues about sheep and cheese. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep; it talks about milk lamb and dairy production. Milk lamb suggests that lambs are used for milk, which is different from sheep being used for cheese. Cheese typically comes from cow or goat milk more commonly than sheep, but the text doesn't specify.

The focus seems to be on reconnecting activities like milk and slaughter, possibly indicating a diversified approach rather than specialized dairy production. Since there's no direct mention of cheese production using sheep's milk, I can't confirm that this VC is involved in producing cheese from sheep.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Slovakia and the key activities include sheep breeding, cow milk production, cheese production, and marketing. The key actors are shepherds, cheese producers, and marketers. So right off the bat, I see that sheep breeding is a part of their value chain, which suggests they might be using sheep for something.

Looking further down, it says that sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia and is present in all mountain NUTS3 regions there. That definitely ties sheep to the value chain. Then, under challenges, it mentions that some producers import sheep's milk from Southern Europe during winter. This imported milk comes from barn-fed sheep rather than grazed ones, which affects milk yield.

The key activities clearly list cheese production, and since they're using sheep's milk (either locally or imported), it stands to reason that the cheese produced would be made from sheep's milk. Therefore, the value chain is involved in using sheep for cheese production.

I don't see any information suggesting they use other animals like cows or goats for their cheese; the focus seems to be on sheep. So putting this together, yes, the mountain value chain in narrative 3027 does involve using sheep to produce cheese.

They process and sell lamb products, specifically mentioning "lamb" as the key product.

It also discusses climate change impacts like biodiversity loss and water balance changes. The VC is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous innovation. Marketing strategies are highlighted as innovative by positioning local specialties. Land use systems involve pasture farming, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention cheese production. It focuses on lamb products, which could include meat but not necessarily dairy products like cheese. Since sheep can be used for both meat and dairy, but the text doesn't specify that they're producing cheese, I shouldn't assume that based solely on sheep farming.

Therefore, since there's no explicit mention of cheese production, the value chain isn't confirmed to be involved in using sheep for cheese.

Adding value to the products by certifying organic production, and/or other certificates that are in line with nature protection are of a great potential. Additionally, connecting the products with sustainable tourism (rural tourism) and other channels for selling these products (e-commerce) creates potential for avoiding low prices and selling animals. Reopening of export to countries asking for halal meat (Middle East, Turkey, etc.) is slowly increasing.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state and talks about livestock husbandry being the main agricultural activity on the Pester plateau. It specifically mentions lamb meat production as the basis of the value chain, with sheep farms solely for this purpose. 

Then it goes into detail about Sjenica lamb meat, dry meat products, and sheep Sjenica cheese, highlighting their high quality and that the cheese is PDO (Protected Designation of Origin). This clearly indicates that sheep are used in the production of cheese.

Additionally, there's a mention of potential to protect the PDO product at the EU level and export it. It also talks about adding value through organic certification and connecting products with sustainable tourism and e-commerce. These points reinforce that sheep-based products, including cheese, are significant in this value chain.

So, putting it all together, the narrative explicitly states that sheep are used to produce cheese, specifically Sjenica cheese which is PDO. Therefore, the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep for cheese production.

The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    For very traditional products, like 'Sirene' cheese, that are produced by small-scale farmers the main challenge is how to 'add value' to the product in order to increase farm / household income.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Bulgaria, with the VC ID 06 BG. It says that most commonly, the products are made from sheep, cow, or goat milk, or a mixture. So right there, it explicitly mentions sheep as one of the sources for cheese production. 

Further down, it talks about challenges faced by small-scale farmers producing traditional products like 'Sirene' cheese. This reinforces that sheep's milk is involved since Sirene is a type of Bulgarian cheese often made from sheep's milk.

The ongoing depopulation of local villages and consequent loss of labour is a major challenge for the farming family and they work with other cooperative members to support each other with haymaking; communal grazing of their sheep and cattle, and; the transport of milk from their sheepfolds in the high mountain pastures. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in this narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the Value Chain (VC) is involved with traditional products like 'Brânză de Burduf' produced by a farming family in Vaideeni. It's registered as a Mountain Product, which helps promote it and builds consumer confidence. The challenges include depopulation leading to labor shortages, so they work with other cooperative members for tasks like haymaking, communal grazing of sheep and cattle, and transporting milk from their sheepfolds in high mountain pastures.

Hmm, the key point here is that they have sheepfolds in high mountain pastures and transport milk from them. That suggests that sheep are part of their livestock. However, the specific mention of cheese production comes when talking about 'Brânză de Burduf' being produced by the farming family. But does this cheese come from sheep's milk?

The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether the cheese is made from sheep's milk or another source like cows. It just says cheeses are produced, including Brânză de Burduf, which I think is typically a cow's milk cheese, but sometimes can be made from other sources. However, since they have sheep and transport milk from their sheepfolds, it's possible that the cheese could be made from sheep's milk.

But wait, the narrative doesn't directly link the production of Brânză de Burduf to sheep. It only mentions that they have sheep for communal grazing and transporting milk. So maybe the cheese is still from cows, but the presence of sheep indicates that they might also produce other cheeses from sheep milk.

However, since the question is whether the value chain uses sheep to produce cheese, even if it's not specified as part of this particular product, I think the answer would be yes because they have sheep and presumably use their milk for some products. But I'm a bit uncertain because Brânză de Burduf isn't explicitly stated to be from sheep.

Wait, maybe I should focus on whether the cheese is produced using sheep. The narrative says they produce cheeses including Brânză de Burduf in a licensed processing unit. It doesn't specify that sheep are used for cheese production beyond the milk transportation part. So perhaps it's safer to say no because there's no direct mention of sheep being used for cheese making, only that they have sheep and transport milk.

But then again, if they're using their sheepfolds to transport milk, maybe that milk is used in cheese production. The narrative doesn't explicitly state this, though. It just mentions the challenges with labor and communal grazing. So without explicit mention of sheep being used for cheese, I might lean towards not involving sheep.

Wait, but the example given earlier had a JSON with an ID when sheep were involved. In this case, since they have sheep and process milk, maybe it's implied that the cheese is made from sheep's milk. But I'm still unsure because Brânză de Burduf is usually cow's milk. Maybe the answer should be no because there's no direct link between sheep and cheese production in the narrative.

I think I need to make a judgment call here. Since they have sheep and transport milk, but don't specify that it's for cheese, perhaps it's safer to say they are involved. But given that Brânză de Burduf is typically cow's milk, maybe not. Alternatively, since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that sheep are used for cheese, I should probably answer no.

Wait, the user message says if the value chain is involved in using sheep to produce cheese, then include the ID; else, empty JSON. So unless it's clear they use sheep for cheese, we shouldn't assume. Since the narrative doesn't explicitly say that, maybe the correct answer is an empty JSON.

The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. One large stakeholder (organization of producers, linked to the biggest dairy) implemented a service that collect the milk lambs of most producers to send them to Sardinia where they are slaughtered. They get the carcasses back and freeze a part of them to sell them later in the year when tourist season has begun. They struggle to add value to their product. farmers have had a project of PGI for their corsican milk lamb for years. They did not succeed yet. They struggle to find durable solutions. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is also present in Austria. Comparaison with production of lamb that is dedicated to meat (Austria, Switzerland, Serbia, Spain) might also been interesting regarding the use of resources linked with specialization.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France INRAE and the VC ID is 11 FR. It talks about "milk lamb" being seasonally produced, mostly in autumn, by around 300 dairy-ewe farmers. So, they're milking sheep, which are called ewes when female.

Next, it says two associations of farmers handle slaughtering the animals and transmitting products in the territory. The focus seems to be on reconnecting activities that were separated due to modernization, like milk lamb production and dairy production. They want to link food production with uses like cooking and eating habits.

The challenges include adding value to their product. A large stakeholder implemented a service collecting milk lambs from producers to send them to Sardinia for slaughter. The carcasses are frozen and sold later during the tourist season. There's also mention of a PGI project for Corsican milk lamb that hasn't succeeded yet.

The innovation is endogenous, related to new processes. Land use systems include grassland, natural areas, and agrosylvopastoral systems like shrubs and oak forests. Local assets are both natural and cultural.

Additionally, the VC is present in Austria, comparing it with meat-focused lamb production in other regions.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used for cheese production. The narrative mentions milk lambs, which implies that sheep's milk is being used. Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows or goats, but sheep's milk can also be used. However, the focus here seems more on meat (slaughtering and selling carcasses) rather than dairy products.

The challenge about adding value to their product doesn't specifically mention cheese; instead, it talks about reconnecting activities that were separated, which might relate more to integrating milk and meat production. The PGI project is for milk lamb, but again, the emphasis is on the meat aspect.

So, while sheep are involved in milk production, there's no explicit mention of using this milk to produce cheese. The main products seem to be meat from the lambs rather than dairy products like cheese.
</think>

The narrative discusses a value chain involving sheep for milk and meat production but does not explicitly mention cheese production. Therefore, it is concluded that the mountain value chain is not involved in producing cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is 02 AT. It talks about an Almenland small local dairy producing various types of cheese, including cow, sheep, and goat milk from the region. So right there, it explicitly lists sheep as one of the sources of milk for their cheeses.

It also mentions that the cheese is made from local hay milk and that they produce many different types. They participate in international competitions and have won awards, which isn't directly relevant but shows they're serious about their cheese production.

The narrative goes on to talk about innovations in products, processes, and marketing strategies. It also notes that the land use system involves pasture farming and that local assets include natural resources. Additionally, it mentions that cheese is produced in many other regions in the Austrian Alps, some using hay milk as well, with a unique maturing process in a former silver mine.

So putting this together, since the dairy specifically lists sheep milk among others for their cheeses, it's clear that the mountain value chain does use sheep to produce cheese. Therefore, I should create a JSON object with the id of the narrative.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, with a specific card ID. That's probably just identifying which region or group it's associated with. Then it says the VC (Value Chain) is composed of small scale farming where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk to sell cheese directly on the farm.

Wait, so right there it mentions that they're producing and transforming sheep's milk into cheese. So yes, they are using sheep for their milk to make cheese. The next part talks about the milk being processed in a certain type of innovation, but since the innovation isn't specified, I don't think that affects whether they use sheep or not.

The land use systems involved are grassland, which makes sense because sheep graze on grasslands. The local assets include natural and cultural aspects, which probably refers to the environment and traditions in Switzerland related to farming.

So putting it all together, the value chain is definitely using sheep's milk for cheese production. Therefore, I should create a JSON with the id of this narrative.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

First, it mentions that the reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID. The VC is dominated by single dairy production and there's a secondary dairy school in Pirot that's guarding tradition and know-how. It says there are around 13,000 sheep produced. 

Then, it goes on to explain that these sheep are from small-scale farmers, and the milking season is May to October. During this time, they use sheep milk for cheese, but the rest of the year, cow milk is used more. So, during part of the year, sheep are involved in dairy production.

The narrative also talks about Pirot kachkaval cheese, which I think is a type made from sheep's milk. It mentions that traditional manufacturing comes from climatic conditions, grass habitats, and the specific mountain region, using milk from autochthonous (local) populations of Pirot sheep. 

So putting this together, the value chain does use sheep to produce cheese, specifically during the milking season when they make kachkaval. Therefore, I should include the ID in the JSON.

The value chain covers all important activities from breeding and husbandry to processing food and products, specifically mentioning sheep products like meat and wool. 

Hmm, so they process sheep products for meat and wool, but does that include cheese? Well, cheese can be made from various sources, including sheep's milk. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese production. It focuses more on meat and wool as the processed products.

Further down, it mentions that farms are creating new marketing channels for their products, which includes sheep products. Again, no direct reference to cheese. The region is picturesque and attracts tourists, with some farms offering agro-tourism services. While tourism might involve selling local products like cheese, there's no specific mention of cheese in the context of production.

The narrative also discusses challenges faced by the VC, such as reliance on subsidies, climate change affecting water availability and grass for feed, and predators like wolves causing damage to sheep farms. These points don't directly relate to cheese production either.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2740 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, with a specific card ID VC 05 BG. It talks about kilim production, which involves traditional farming systems where sheep graze on mountain pastures. The processing of their wool is highlighted as an important part of Bulgarian heritage and was recognized by UNESCO in 2014.

Now, the key points here are that sheep are used for their wool, specifically for making kilims, which are woven rugs or carpets. There's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the narrative. The focus is on wool processing and weaving, not dairy products like cheese.

I should also consider if there's any indirect link between sheep and cheese. Typically, sheep are used for both meat and dairy, but since the narrative doesn't discuss cheese at all, I can't assume that just because they have sheep, they're making cheese. The context is strictly about wool production and kilim weaving.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned relate to the decline in the kilim industry due to market loss, unemployment, and demographic issues. These are all tied to the textile aspect, not dairy or cheese production.

So, putting it all together, the mountain value chain here is involved with sheep for their wool, not for producing cheese. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state and talks about livestock husbandry being the main agricultural activity in the Zlatar Mountain area. It specifically mentions cattle breeding as the basis of the value chain, with a large number of farmer households involved in small dairies. The number of cattle is decreasing, along with the rural population keeping animals.

It then discusses attempts to organize farmers to manage PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) Zlatar cheese, aiming to increase its visibility and prevent misuse by other producers outside the area. There's also mention of increased tourism but without proper planning, some urbanization, and threats to wildlife like big vultures.

The narrative goes on to talk about certification and legal protection for Zlatar cheese as priorities. It classifies the value chain as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types. Grazing on natural pastures is a major production system, and farmers are getting involved in protecting the cheese by selling it to restaurants and shops in big cities. There's also mention of transitioning to organic production without large investments.

Nowhere in this narrative do they specifically mention sheep being used for cheese production. The focus is on cattle breeding and dairy products, particularly Zlatar cheese. While sheep are sometimes used for cheese (like in the case of feta or other cheeses), there's no indication here that sheep are involved. The emphasis is on cows and managing a specific type of cheese that's protected.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese. They're focused on cattle and their dairy products.

Since the value chain involves milk processing, and sheep are providing the milk, it stands to reason that this milk is being used to produce cheese.

Additionally, the narrative talks about pasture in the mountains representing a cultural landscape identity, which supports the idea that sheep are part of their dairy operations. There's also mention of challenges related to milk quality, which again ties back to sheep's milk being processed into products like cheese.

So putting it all together, yes, the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep to produce cheese because they specifically source milk from sheep for their products.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and asked whether sheep are used to produce cheese in it. If they are, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that dairy cattle enterprises are small scale, and cows graze in the highlands. Livestock is the main livelihood for households. The cheeses produced are Kars Gruyere and Kashar, both traditional types. 

Looking further, it specifies that pasture-based cow's milk is used in cheese production. It also mentions Zavot cows' milk being used. There's no mention of sheep anywhere in the narrative. The focus is entirely on cows and their milk for cheese production.

I should check if there are any indirect references to sheep, but from what I see, all dairy activities revolve around cattle. Since the question is specifically about using sheep, and there's no indication of that here, it seems clear that sheep aren't involved.

Therefore, since the value chain isn't using sheep for cheese production, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

The resulting curd is removed into cheesecloth, drained and pressed overnight, then cut into square pieces. This

'Telemea' is a salted white cheese most commonly made from sheep or cows' milk, but sometimes also from goats' milk. Varying degrees of ageing. Widepread traditional mountain product in Romania. Similar to Greek 'feta'. This specific value chain is for a 'Telemea' made from cows' milk by a small-scale producer in Vaideeni commune (174021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-telemea-din-lapte-de-vaca/).   The natural asset used for producing 'Telemea' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing).    Value chains for artisanal products such as the 'Telemea' produced in the Vaideeni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality / 'counterfeit' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Romania is the reference member state and the VC 10 RO as the card ID. It talks about 'Telemea' cheese being made by adding rennet to milk, curdling it, then draining and pressing overnight before cutting into squares. So far, no mention of sheep yet.

Next, it provides some statistics on employment sectors but that's probably not relevant here. Then it says 'Telemea' is a salted white cheese commonly made from sheep or cows' milk, sometimes goats'. Hmm, so sheep is an option, but the specific value chain in question is for Telemea made from cows' milk by a small-scale producer in Vaideeni commune.

The narrative continues to mention that this specific VC uses semi-natural grasslands for hay-making and communal grazing. It also discusses the challenges of artisanal products like Telemea being vulnerable due to counterfeit products and external factors like COVID affecting sales. They're registered as a Mountain Product, which helps with promotion but still rely on direct sales.

So, putting it all together: The general description includes that Telemea can be made from sheep or cows' milk, but the specific value chain in this narrative is using cows' milk. Therefore, they are not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not use sheep for producing cheese; it specifically uses cows' milk.

Okay, I need to determine if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain involves dairies collecting milk from about 300 dairy farmers. These farmers are mostly dairy-Ewe and some dairy-Goat farmers. It says they make their own cheese, specifically mentioning "two ('m" which might be a typo or abbreviation for types of cheese like Tomme or similar.

The land use systems include grassland, natural land, and agrosylvopastoral systems with shrubs, oak forests (which produce acorns), and meadows. The local assets are both natural and cultural. Cheese production is observed in various MRLs (maybe mountain regions) including Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland.

The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep but does talk about dairy-Ewe and dairy-Goat farmers. Ewes are a type of sheep used for milk, so it's likely that sheep are involved. However, the focus is more on cheese production in general rather than specifically using sheep's milk.

Wait, the user asked if the value chain uses sheep to produce cheese. Since the narrative mentions dairy-Ewe farmers, which implies they have sheep (ewes), and they make cheese, it seems like sheep are part of this process. Therefore, the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep for cheese production.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 RO. Specialist trading companies such as 'Seradria' have a network of partners managing collection points in the main sheep producing regions in Romania. 'Seradria' has annual capa

This is an important value chain for sheep farmers in the Carpathians, especially for supporting the finacial viability of many small farms and thereby ensuring their continued existence and contribution to the maintenance of the traditional farming practices that are important for biodiversity conservation and the valued mountain landscapes.   The live sheep and lambs collected from local farms for export are usually from the most two common breeds found in the Carpathians - the Tsurcana breed (a traditional indigenous breed that was favoured by Romanian transhumance shepherds and is still very popular in mountain villages) and the Tsigai breed (a more recently introduced breed that is more common in the hilly sub-mountainous areas of the Carpathians).    The live export of sheep and lambs is highly controversial because of the animal welfare issues associated with transporting live animals over long distances. This tragically was brought to the attention of the global media in November 2019 when a cargo ship carrying almost 15,000 sheep capsized in the Black Sea shortly after leaving Romania for Saudi Arabia - for more details see here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/europe/romanian-sheep-cargo-ship.html.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2949 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative mentions that 'Seradria' is a specialist trading company with a network of partners managing collection points for live sheep and lambs. It talks about annual capacity and market value related to these exports. The breeds mentioned are Tsurcana and Tsigai, which are common in Romania's Carpathians.

The main focus seems to be on the export of live sheep and lambs, particularly for slaughter, rather than dairy production. There's a mention of controversy regarding animal welfare during transportation but nothing about cheese production. The value chain is described as traditional and important for small farms, supporting their financial viability through exports.

I don't see any information about cheese or dairy products being part of this value chain. It's all about live animals, specifically sheep and lambs, being collected and exported. So, it doesn't involve using sheep to produce cheese.

The mountain value chain in narrative 2949 is focused on the export of live sheep and lambs for slaughter, not on producing cheese. Therefore, it does not involve using sheep for dairy production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Slovakia, with a specific card ID VC 04 SK. The key activities listed are sheep breeding, wool selling, wool processing, and marketing. The key actors involved are sheep breeders, processors, and consumers. 

Looking at the positive impact, it's on local and regional SE, but I'm not sure what SE stands for here—it might be a typo or an abbreviation. Moving on, the narrative mentions that the wool is sold primarily to foreign markets. There was a significant drop in prices due to cheap imported sheep wool from abroad.

It also states that currently, there's no industrial wool processor in Slovakia. The challenges faced are classified as Current. The value chain is both Traditional and Innovative, with an endogenous type of innovation. They've rediscovered manual wool processing, which relates to new products. The land use system involved is Grassland, and the local assets include Natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used for cheese production. From the key activities listed—sheep breeding, wool selling, wool processing—it seems that the primary focus here is on wool, not dairy products. Sheep breeding might be for both meat and wool, but there's no mention of cheese or dairy processing in the narrative.

Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or sheep. If the value chain were involved in cheese, I would expect activities like milking, cheese making, or dairy processing to be listed as key activities. However, all the key activities here revolve around wool—breeding for wool, selling wool, processing wool.

Additionally, the challenges mentioned are related to wool prices and the lack of industrial processors for wool. There's no indication that they're facing issues with dairy production or cheese sales. The innovation is about manual wool processing, not dairy innovations.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain in this narrative doesn't seem to be involved in using sheep to produce cheese. They are focused on wool instead.
</think>

The mountain value chain described focuses on sheep breeding and wool-related activities, without mentioning cheese production. Therefore, it is not involved in using sheep for cheese.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member states Italy UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 01 IT. It mentions Parmigiano Reggiano DOP, which is described as a hard cheese made from raw cow's milk. So right away, I see that the primary source of milk here is cows, not sheep.

The narrative goes on to talk about the consortium's goals: protecting PDO status, supervising production and trade, promoting it internationally. It mentions challenges as "Current" and classifies the VC as Traditional. The innovation type isn't specified, but the focus seems to be on maintaining traditional methods.

Next, it discusses 'Mountain product' quality, which has additional rules about geographical origin, cow breeding in mountain areas, and cheese aging. Specifically, it says 100% of the milk comes from stables in mountain areas, more than 60% of cows' feed is grown there, and dairy and maturing happen for at least a year in the mountains.

Looking through all this information, I don't see any mention of sheep being involved. The cheese is clearly made from cow's milk, and the focus is on cows' feed and breeding. There's no indication that sheep are part of this value chain at all.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain isn't using sheep to produce cheese. It's entirely focused on cows for milk production.

Epirus Feta is a PDO product. Ammotopos region as a whole is rugged and mountainous. Sheep and goat pastoralism have always been an important activity in the region (Epirus provides more than 45% of milkt to the Greek market) but there seems to be a decline in recent years.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Greece, specifically the Epirus region. It talks about small animal husbandry farmers where milk production is their main income source. The company EPIRUS SA operates there, and they're involved in producing Epirus Feta, which is a PDO product.

PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, meaning it's recognized for its unique characteristics tied to the region. So, this cheese must be significant culturally and economically. The narrative mentions that sheep and goat farming are important, contributing over 45% of milk to the Greek market. It also notes that cheese production is traditional and has been granted awards.

Looking at the key points: they have small farmers producing milk, which is used for cheese. Specifically, Epirus Feta is made from sheep's milk or a combination since it's common in many regions to use sheep and goats for feta. The region's rugged mountainous terrain supports pastoralism, which aligns with sheep herding.

The narrative doesn't explicitly say "sheep," but it does mention that the goat and sheep farming sector is strong, and cheese production is a traditional product. Since Epirus Feta is a type of cheese typically made from sheep or goat milk, especially in regions like Greece, it's safe to assume they're using sheep for this.

So, putting it all together, yes, the mountain value chain here involves using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France CCVD and the VC ID is 07 FR1. It talks about Picodon AOP being a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region. So right away, I see that it's specifically a goat cheese. The term "goat-milk" is used, which clearly indicates that goats are involved in the production.

Further down, it mentions that farmers practice pastoralisme and there are dairy producers working in companies. However, all these details still revolve around goat milk. There's no mention of sheep at any point in the narrative. The challenges faced by the value chain include issues like wolf predation, droughts, biodiversity impact, diseases, and parasites—again, all related to goat farming.

The narrative also discusses the valorisation of goat meat and diversification for small producers, but again, this is about goats, not sheep. It's important to note that while both sheep and goats are ruminants, in this context, the cheese is explicitly tied to goat milk.

I should make sure I'm not confusing similar terms or assuming anything beyond what's written. The narrative doesn't mention sheep at all, so there's no indication that sheep are used for cheese production here. It's entirely focused on goats and their products.

Therefore, since the value chain is about goat-milk cheese and there's no reference to sheep, I should conclude that it's not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The products are made by small-scale on-farm processors using local pigs from the nustrale breed, reared in extensive conditions with chestnuts and acorns.

It mentions three PDOs as examples, highlighting the association of domestic animal and plant biodiversity, including both spontaneous and cultivated resources, along with traditional knowledge in processing and tasting. The value chain's interest lies in the coupling between human and non-human components that support market and environmental values.

The challenges include maintaining the integration of farming, processing, and product reputation while managing environmental resources like chestnut groves and oak trees. There are issues with diseases affecting chestnuts (cynips disease) and threats to old orchards. The question is about how to create common chestnut groves between harvest and breeding.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation. This involved defining a breed standard for the nustrale breed, setting strategic breeding periods (slaughter age, finishing feed, slow growth), adopting new processing techniques like gentle salting of the prisuttu, and defining products in terms of certain characteristics.

Now, looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative talks about pigs (nustrale breed) being used to produce products through small-scale on-farm processors. There's no reference to sheep at all. Cheese isn't specifically mentioned either; the focus is more on processing techniques and product definition without naming specific dairy products.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain in question doesn't involve using sheep for cheese production. It's centered around pigs and their products, particularly involving chestnuts and acorns.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on pigs and their products.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Hungary, with a specific card ID. It talks about traditional production of cabbages—red, white, cauliflower, etc.—produced by small farmers and integrated by a larger one. They market through both... I'm not sure what exactly, but it's about cabbage production.

The employment statistics are given for the region: 4.47% in primary sector, 42.86% secondary, and 52.67% tertiary. That doesn't directly relate to sheep or cheese, so I'll note that but move on.

Next, it says they've successfully integrated small traditional cabbage producers into a larger local producer who handles logistics, storage, processing, and trading. They're part of the European Territorial Quality Mark system. The narrative mentions that cabbage is traditional in mountain agriculture but that small producers are struggling due to marketing issues and competition from large-scale operations. Integration seems to be their solution.

The favorable conditions include good weather, soil, and a long cultural tradition of cabbage production. They have human capacity for logistics and technology from a recycled processing plant. They're connected with local LEADER LAG for marketing and community actions.

Challenges include communication between producers, finding markets, climate change issues like droughts and extreme weather, and keeping producers interested in networks. The VC is classified as Traditional, dealing with current and predicted challenges.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about cabbages—growing, integrating small farmers, marketing, and the associated challenges. There's no indication that sheep are involved in any part of this value chain, whether for dairy products like cheese or otherwise.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain here is focused on cabbage production, not sheep for cheese.

The narrative mentions that the VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion' which promotes local food specialties and sets quality standards. It specifically talks about sheep playing a crucial role in mountain farming, and maintaining pasture farming for cultural landscapes important for tourism. 

It also notes that sheep farming has a centuries-old tradition there. In the 1950s, they shifted to meat production to find new marketing opportunities. The region's high mountains limit practices, making sheep farming one of the few income options. They face challenges from climate change but are classified as both traditional and innovative.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese production. It talks about meat production and marketing local specialties, but cheese isn't specifically highlighted. So, based on the content given, I don't see evidence that sheep are used to produce cheese here.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 FR. In Corsica, on-farm cheese making is defended by an association of farmers (of dairy goats and dairy ewes), Casgiu Casanu, which has existed since 1998 and has been locally and nationally active. It defends farmers' interests regarding the evolution of european and national regulations. It provides specific training (hygiene, different processes for transformation of milk) and it has developped an efficient structure for cheeses' transport, in Corsica and in the French Continent. As on-farm cheese making often plays a key role in preserving traditional know-how, it is recognized in a geographical indication (PDO Brocciu) and plays a central role in the on-going labelling project (5 different projets regarding different types of local cheeses: venachese, sartinese, calinzanincu, niolincu, bastelicacciu). Of-farm cheese making is particularly present in mountainous areas where it is one of the remaining (agricultural) activities. It contributes to the villages' vividness. In its traditional form, this type of husbandry contributes to land management near those villages.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France INRAE and the Value Chain (VC) ID is 03 FR. It talks about Corsica where on-farm cheese making is supported by an association called Casgiu Casanu, which has been around since 1998. This association represents dairy goat and dairy ewe farmers.

So, they're involved with both goats and sheep (ewes are female sheep). The narrative mentions that these farmers make cheese on their farms and have training programs for hygiene and different milk transformation processes. They also handle transportation of cheeses both locally and to the mainland.

The value chain is linked to Corsican mountains, which makes sense because mountainous areas often have dairy farming as part of their agricultural activities. It's noted that traditional forms of husbandry contribute to land management near villages and help keep the local economy active.

Now, the question is whether sheep are used in producing cheese here. The narrative explicitly mentions "dairy goats and dairy ewes," so ewes are female sheep raised for milk. Since they're making cheese from their milk, that means sheep (ewes) are indeed involved in the production of cheese within this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain is using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2797 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that "Milk lamb is seasonally produced, mostly in autumn, by approximately 300 dairy-ewe farmers." So, they're talking about milk from ewes, which are female sheep. That suggests that sheep are being used for their milk. 

Next, it says that two associations of farmers intervene for slaughtering the animals and "corres d," but I'm not sure what "corres d" stands for here. Maybe it's a typo or an abbreviation. However, the key point is that they're dealing with dairy ewes, which are used for milk production.

Since cheese is typically made from milk, and in this case, the sheep (ewes) are being milked, it makes sense that the value chain would be involved in producing cheese from their milk. Even though the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese, the context of using sheep's milk strongly implies that cheese production is part of the process.

Therefore, I can conclude that the mountain value chain in this narrative does use sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID. It talks about donkeys being kept in natural environments, grazing or fed hay and oat when needed. They follow organic production principles aimed at sustainable development. The challenges are current and predicted, and the VC is both traditional and innovative.

The innovation types are endogenous and exogenous. Donkey milk is described as high quality but not commonly used because of low quantities per animal. It mentions that Balkan donkeys were present but became obsolete in recent decades, leading to many being sold or slaughtered for meat. The farm buys donkeys from Serbia and the region, providing them with better living conditions.

They sell donkey milk as a healthy drink and make soaps from it, combining it with medical herbs. They're also planning to integrate into rural tourism, offering tours where visitors can see how donkeys are milked and live. The innovations relate to new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. Land use includes cropland, grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets are natural, social, and cultural.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about donkeys and their milk being used for soap and as a drink. There's no indication that sheep are involved at all, let alone producing cheese. So, the mountain value chain here isn't using sheep to make cheese.

The mountain value chain in narrative 3002 does not involve the use of sheep for cheese production.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Read the Narrative:** The narrative describes a value chain focused on donkeys, detailing their care, milk production, and products like soap and rural tourism.
2. **Identify Key Elements:** The focus is on donkey milk, with no mention of sheep or cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Greece and the VC ID is VC 21 GR. It talks about female family members involved in processing milk and preparing wheat to make xinochontros, also known as ksinochondros. This product is described as high-priced and a potential prospect for graziers. It's traditional but not well-known among younger consumers.

The quality of milk and local wheat makes it unique, even referred to as a superfood. The challenges faced are both current and predicted. The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation. This means the innovation comes from within the region or system. The innovation aspects include sour cream, which has high shelf life, low production costs, and high nutritional value using local resources.

The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry, and Natural land. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural elements. Xinochontros is produced in several places in Crete and has penetrated Greek gastronomy as an alternative to cereals for breakfast.

Now, the key point here is whether sheep are used in producing cheese. The narrative mentions processing milk but doesn't specify which type of milk—sheep, cow, goat, etc. It does talk about graziers, who typically manage herds, possibly of sheep or goats. However, xinochontros is made from wheat and milk, but without explicit mention of the source animal.

I'm trying to recall if xinochontros is traditionally associated with sheep's milk. From what I know, many Greek cheeses like feta are made from sheep's milk, but xinochontros isn't a cheese I'm familiar with—it sounds more like a porridge or a dish made from wheat and milk. So maybe it's not cheese at all but another dairy product.

Since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that sheep are used for producing cheese, just that milk is processed, I can't confirm that sheep are involved in making cheese here. Therefore, the value chain isn't necessarily using sheep to produce cheese based on the given information.

The key natural asset for a trout farm such as this is a clean (unpolluted) source of water - in this case, a local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid).

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID is 3097, which I should note in case I need to include it later. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland, and the key actors are small individual winegrowers selling grapes to bigger wineries. That already hints towards a focus on wine production rather than dairy or cheese.

Next, the narrative talks about 75.8% of producers cultivating sustainability and enhancing biodiversity. It also mentions the challenge faced by the VC as unspecified but classifies it as Traditional with no specific innovation type mentioned. The land use system is Cropland, and local assets include Natural aspects.

Now, I need to check if there's any mention of sheep or cheese production in this narrative. Scanning through, I don't see any references to sheep, dairy products, or cheese. The focus seems entirely on wine grapes and wineries. There's no indication that the value chain involves livestock or dairy processing.

Since the narrative doesn't mention sheep or cheese at all, it's clear that the mountain value chain here isn't involved in using sheep for cheese production. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should output an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3006 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The main activities are various tours and touristic offers created by an Adventure Network, including things like hiking, sky running, yoga retreats, etc. It also talks about environmental impacts such as poor waste management, construction in protected areas, pollution of rivers and Lake Zavoj.

Then it mentions that the prevailing farming is livestock production, specifically sheep and cows, which are used for meat production, milk, and dairy products. So here, they're talking about sheep being used for both meat and dairy. The narrative also notes that the number of animals is rapidly reducing, and there are two autochthonous breeds: Karakachan sheep and Busha cattle. These breeds are at risk of disappearing.

The challenge faced by this VC is described as Current and Predicted, and it's classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovations mentioned are endogenous and exogenous, focusing on creating sustainable touristic offers that protect nature and local identity.

So, the key point here is that sheep are used for milk and dairy products. Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows or sheep. Since the narrative explicitly states that sheep are used for dairy products, it's reasonable to conclude that cheese production is part of this value chain.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in narrative 3006 does involve using sheep to produce cheese.

The main actor is a cooperative called Weizer Schafbauern - Die Schaferei, which owns the brand Määh for their products. They also mention another important actor selling products under the same brand.

The innovation here relates to new products and marketing strategies. Land use systems involved are pasture farming, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. It's noted that mountain sheep farming is traditional in 13 other regions in Austria, though not all of them are mountainous.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production using sheep. The narrative talks about sheep farming but doesn't explicitly state that they produce cheese. They do have a brand and sell products, which could include dairy products, but without specific information about cheese, I can't confirm it.

Therefore, since there's no direct indication that the value chain uses sheep for cheese production, I should return an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2832 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) based in Hungary, specifically VC 07 HU. It's part of a high-value local products cluster run by a monastery that combines tradition with modern design and marketing. The managers have strong ties to the monastery, either as monks or graduates from its school. They produce various items like herbs, wine, beer, fruits, vegetables, and have a local shop, design, and marketing sections.

The products mentioned include chocolate and biscuits made with local herbs, honey, etc., processed and packaged with innovative design. The land use systems are cropland and forestry, and the assets are natural, social, and cultural. It's an UNESCO World Heritage site, which helps in their operations.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or cheese production. They talk about herbs, honey, wine, beer, fruits, vegetables, chocolate, biscuits, etc., but no indication that sheep are involved or that cheese is being produced. The focus seems to be on other local products rather than dairy products from sheep.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't mention sheep or cheese, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece, with a specific card ID. It talks about the production of Dry Anthotyros affecting breeders on the Lasithi plateau and their families. The product brings together breeders, cultural aspects, starting from final products to producers. 

It mentions it's a standard traditional cheese factory since 1984, so cheesemaking is important for the area's sustainability—both economically and socially. Dry Anthotyros is described as a traditional cheese with ancient origins, part of Crete's cultural heritage.

The challenges include population decline and low incomes due to non-standardized products. The VC is classified as Traditional, with unspecified innovation related to the whole chain. Land use systems are grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. It also notes that Dry Anthotyros is produced by small family firms and cooperatives across Crete.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep. It talks about breeders but doesn't specify the type of animals. However, since it's a traditional cheese from Crete, which is known for cheeses like feta or anthotyros made from sheep milk, I might infer that sheep are used.

But wait, the user instructed to use only the content given as context and not rely on external knowledge. So, if the narrative doesn't mention sheep, I shouldn't assume based on real-world knowledge. The narrative does talk about breeders but doesn't specify they're sheep breeders or that their milk is used for cheese.

Therefore, since there's no explicit mention of sheep being used in the production, I should conclude that the value chain isn't confirmed to be using sheep for cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2973 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The reference card ID is VC 14 UK. It mentions Highland cattle being symbolic of Scotland and a cultural asset, kept both for their cultural significance and good genetics. There's some discussion about challenges related to market changes or climate impacts on these cattle.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation aspects are described as Endogenous (internal) and Exogenous (external). Specifically, keeping Highland cows for meat and genetics is traditional, but their role as a territorial/cultural identity symbol is new and innovative. Innovations here relate to new products and marketing strategies.

Looking at the land use systems involved: Grassland, Forestry, and Natural land. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural elements. The narrative also mentions where Highland cattle are found—across RR9 areas and lowland regions, with main stockists near cities like Aberdeenshire and Central belt near Edinburgh. Breeders are global, including South America, USA, Australia, and Europe.

Now, the key point is whether sheep are used to produce cheese in this value chain. The narrative doesn't mention sheep at all. It's focused entirely on Highland cattle for meat and genetics, as well as their cultural role. There's no reference to dairy production, cheese-making, or any use of sheep in the process.

So, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain. The focus is on Highland cattle, not sheep.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on Highland cattle for meat and cultural significance.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Greece and the card ID is VC 03 GR. It talks about meat production affecting pastures in Anogeia and their families. The prospects of the product bring together pastures, cultural associations, and local authorities. It also notes that many different microclimates contribute to unique sheep breeds in each mountainous area of Crete, like the Anogeia tribe and Sfakia tribe.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production. The narrative does discuss meat production but doesn't explicitly say anything about cheese. While it's common in some regions for sheep to be used for both meat and dairy products, the text here only mentions meat affecting pastures and the existence of different sheep breeds due to microclimates.

Since there's no direct reference to cheese or dairy products being part of the value chain, I can't assume that sheep are used for cheese production. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this narrative doesn't seem involved in producing cheese from sheep.

They mention using photovoltaics and heat pumps for energy, which is innovative but doesn't relate to sheep or dairy products. The focus seems to be on improving the supply chain from cereals to baked goods, with innovations in processes like sourdough and grain production.

There's no mention of sheep, cheese, or any dairy-related activities. Instead, it's centered around grains and bread. So, based on this information, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for cheese production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary and the VC ID is VC 23 HU. It talks about three different cheese producers in the Nivegy-valley micro-region. They produce high-quality artisanal cheeses and milk products. The key part here is where it says they keep animals, specifically goats and cows. 

So, the narrative explicitly mentions goat and cow as the animals they keep. There's no mention of sheep anywhere in the text. Even though cheese can be made from various sources like sheep or buffalo milk, this particular value chain only uses goats and cows. Therefore, since sheep aren't part of their animal husbandry, they don't use sheep to produce cheese.

I should also consider if there's any indirect reference or possibility that sheep might be involved, but the text doesn't hint at it. It clearly states goat and cow, so I can confidently say sheep aren't used here.

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep in producing cheese; only goats and cows are referenced.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the farm produces honey from various sources like dandelion, acacia, lime, chestnut trees, wildflowers, and alpine flora. It also notes that they have over sixty hives producing characteristic honeys and cultivate small fruits for jams.

Nowhere in this description do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on honey and jam products. There's no indication that the farm raises sheep or uses them in any way related to dairy or cheesemaking. 

Additionally, the narrative talks about beekeepers' knowledge and plant species as key assets, which further reinforces that the value chain revolves around apiculture (beekeeping) rather than livestock farming for dairy products.

Since there's no information suggesting sheep are involved in cheese production within this value chain, I conclude that it doesn't involve using sheep for that purpose.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Serbia, with the reference card ID VC 18 SER. It talks about local pickers, purchasing stations, processors, wholesale, retail, and end consumers like markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and health shops. The value chain (VC) is underutilized and has potential for growth in production. They suggest new marketing strategies to target niche consumer markets interested in nature and health, emphasizing that these are mushrooms from Kopaonik mountain.

The narrative then mentions that local pickers make up 65% who sell to purchasing stations, while the other 35% consume them themselves. The product is dependent on ecological factors like soil quality, climate, and shady conditions. It also notes underused capacity due to environmental issues, particularly drought from climate change (CC). The VC is described as complicated, facing current and predicted challenges, and classified as traditional.

Innovation in the VC is both endogenous and exogenous but currently limited. There's potential for increasing production and marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects. It's a long and complicated VC.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used in this value chain to produce cheese. Looking through the narrative, the key product mentioned is mushrooms, specifically from Kopaonik mountain. The participants include pickers, purchasing stations, processors, etc., but there's no mention of sheep or dairy products like cheese. The focus seems entirely on mushroom production and its associated challenges and opportunities.

Sheep are typically involved in producing milk for cheese, but since the narrative doesn't reference any livestock or dairy processing, it's clear that sheep aren't part of this value chain. Instead, it's centered around wild mushrooms picked by local people and processed through various stages to reach consumers.

Therefore, the mountain value chain in narrative 3004 is not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms, and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff, poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines, low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition, lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment, and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Bulgaria and the card ID is VC 08 BG. It talks about the profitability of dairy farms depending on the price for raw milk, which in turn depends on milk quality. The key quality indicators are cleanliness, absence of veterinary substances, freedom from pathogens, and no colostrum until seven days after calving.

It goes on to say that achieving these standards is a challenge for many farmers in Western Stara Planina. Problems include lack of trained staff, poor vet services, unguided use of medicines, low-quality livestock, inadequate nutrition, and poor management. Because of this, the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 to represent both farmers and dairies.

The reference mountain chain is Western Stara Planina (Balkan Mountains), specifically Godech Municipality in Sofia Province.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative focuses on dairy farms and milk quality but doesn't specify the type of livestock used. It mentions "livestock" generally but not sheep specifically. Cheese is mentioned as a product, but again, without specifying if it's from sheep's milk.

Since there's no explicit information about using sheep for cheese production, I can't confirm that the value chain involves sheep in this process. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Gran Alpin is a label for cereals produced organically above a certain altitude. It talks about supporting more varieties of cereal and how the label helps products sell at higher prices by emphasizing their quality. There's mention of keeping the value chain local by reviving old mills, which suggests a focus on traditional methods.

Looking further, the challenges include water scarcity, dry weather, and pests affecting farmers. The classification is as an Innovative value chain with endogenous innovation, focusing on new marketing strategies through the label. The land use system involved is Cropland, and local assets are Natural, social, and cultural.

Now, I need to check if sheep or cheese production is mentioned anywhere. Scanning through the text, there's no mention of sheep, dairy products, or cheese. The focus seems entirely on cereals—how they're grown, labeled, marketed, and the challenges faced in their production. There's nothing about livestock or dairy processing.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't involve using sheep for cheese production, I should output an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Milk Kid is seasonally produced, mostly for Christmas by about 200 farmers. It talks about an association of farmers handling slaughter and logistics. The products are sold directly from farmers or through butchers' shops. 

Next, it describes the reference mountain chain as Corsican mountains, part of Corsica, an island with diverse landscapes. Small ruminant farming is highlighted, which has been a transhumant activity, meaning animals are moved seasonally to different pastures. Farmers use mountain pastures during summer, and while some have settled in plains and hillsides, others continue the traditional practice.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used for cheese production. The narrative mentions small ruminants but doesn't specify whether they're sheep or goats. It talks about slaughtering animals for carcasses, which suggests meat production rather than dairy. Milk Kid is a product, possibly related to milk, but without explicit mention of cheese.

Additionally, the focus seems to be on slaughter and selling carcasses through various channels, not on dairy processing like cheesemaking. There's no indication of cheese being part of this value chain. Therefore, it doesn't seem involved in using sheep for cheese production.

Okay, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2770 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is based in the Czech Republic and refers to syrup producers. It says they collect ingredients from mountain regions but process them nearby. The key points are about traditional knowledge, cultural traits, and symbolic mountain references on product labels. 

The challenges faced by this VC include valorization and marketing strategies, and it's classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation. Land use systems involve natural land, and local assets include both natural and cultural aspects. However, the narrative emphasizes that the VC isn't particularly important in terms of using tangible natural resources but is embedded in the mountain region, focusing on intangible resources.

Nowhere in this description do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is on syrups, not dairy products. Therefore, the value chain doesn't involve using sheep to make cheese.

Welsh Lamb is designated with a PGI mark (since 2003), and it is often considered as the best lamb in the worls. It is reared uing traditional non-intensive processes on (upland) land which is not viable to be used for crop growing or similar activities. Within the Powys area lamb farmers, butchers, abbatoir workers and local shops are involved in the VC. Also local auction houses are involved. The lamb is sold in butchers, supermarkets and in meat boxes online. Welsh lamb, beef and pork industry combined has a value of over £1 billion a year to the Welsh economy and it consumes only 5% of the red meat it produces so exports are very important. Lamb and beef exports account for one third of all sales and are worth more than £224 million (2013). The industry supports over 50,000 jobs.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative ID 2971 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with references to Scotland Hutton and VC 12 UK. It mentions Welsh Lamb being designated with a PGI mark since 2003, which is considered the best lamb in the world. The rearing process uses traditional non-intensive methods on upland land not suitable for crops.

It goes on to describe various stakeholders involved in the VC, such as farmers, butchers, abattoir workers, local shops, and auction houses. The products are sold in butchers, supermarkets, and online meat boxes. The economic impact is significant, contributing over £1 billion annually to the Welsh economy. Exports are a major part of their sales, with lamb and beef exports worth over £224 million in 2013.

The reference mountain chain is East Wales (NUTS 2), specifically Powys, which is rural and includes areas popular for hiking like the Brecon Beacons. The area's size is given as approximately 5195 square kilometers.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production involving sheep. The narrative focuses on lamb and beef, discussing their rearing, processing, sales, and economic impact. There's no indication that sheep are used to produce cheese here. It's all about meat products—lamb, beef, pork—and their distribution channels.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain in this narrative is not involved in using sheep for cheese production. They're focused on meat rather than dairy or cheese.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep to produce cheese; it focuses solely on meat products.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2, with a specific card ID. It talks about Alpine Gruyère being produced seasonally from April to October in 53 alpine chalets. The production is organized by the Gruyère Interprofession created in 1997.

Looking at the sectors, primary sector employment is around 4.91% in the province and 4.63% in the region. Secondary sector is higher, like 43% in the province and 23.61% in the region. Tertiary is the highest, which makes sense for a developed country.

The narrative describes Gruyère as an emblematic Swiss cheese, known worldwide with high quality and international reputation. It mentions that it's successfully registered under a quality scheme with PDO, connected to cattle farming, which is the main farming system in Switzerland. So, they're emphasizing cattle here.

Dairy production is based on pastures, which are part of the typical Swiss cultural landscape. Grazing depends on these landscapes, and without cattle, the land would revert to forests. Cheese production helps value milk produced in large quantities nationally and maintains the landscape and biodiversity.

It also mentions that Gruyère production relies on traditional and historical know-how. However, there's a threat from climate change causing droughts, affecting fodder and spruce trees in pastures.

Nowhere in this narrative is sheep mentioned. It specifically talks about cattle farming as the main system and Gruyère being connected to it. So, the mountain value chain here isn't involved with sheep for cheese production; instead, it's all about cows.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep in producing cheese. Instead, it focuses on cattle farming and the production of Alpine Gruyère.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 TR. The number of farmers engaged in goat and sheep breeding in the region is 1179 and 1572, respectively. Since pasture areas are insufficient, goat and sheep breeders purchase feed from feed suppliers. However, high feed prices increase the cost of production. The most frequently used marketing channels for product sales are usually retailers, companies and traders from outside the region. In addition, it is observed that the producers make direct sales to consumers and hotels. However, direct sales are not at a high level. One of the most important problems in the value chain is the marketing of high quality products at low prices. The producers are trying to avoid this problem by selling directly. It is seen that the producers are members of the Sheep and Goat Breeders Association in Antalya. This union takes part in the implementation of animal breeding programs at the regional level to increase productivity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Bey mountains, Antalya.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3148 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Turkey and the VC ID is VC 01 TR. It talks about farmers engaged in goat and sheep breeding, with specific numbers: 1179 for goats and 1572 for sheep. So, sheep are definitely part of this value chain.

Next, it says that because pasture areas are insufficient, these breeders purchase feed from suppliers. High feed prices are a problem, increasing production costs. The marketing channels include retailers, companies, traders outside the region, direct sales to consumers and hotels, but direct sales aren't high. There's an issue with selling high-quality products at low prices, so producers try to sell directly.

The narrative also mentions that producers are members of the Sheep and Goat Breeders Association in Antalya, which is involved in animal breeding programs to boost productivity. The reference mountain chain is the Bey Mountains, specifically Korkuteli district, known for its small plains and hills overlooking the Mediterranean.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used here for cheese production. While the narrative discusses sheep breeding, it doesn't explicitly mention cheese production. It talks about marketing channels and associations but focuses on breeding and feed issues rather than dairy products or cheese.

So, even though sheep are part of the value chain, there's no direct evidence that they're being used to produce cheese. The main points revolve around breeding and marketing challenges without specifying cheese as a product.
</think>

The narrative discusses sheep breeding and marketing but does not explicitly mention cheese production. Therefore, it is concluded that the mountain value chain is not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The activities are described as traditional mountain activities complemented with building something, but it's unclear exactly what that something is.

The type of innovation in this value chain is endogenous, meaning it comes from within the local community. Forest management is highlighted as a typical and traditional activity based on local knowledge. They use modern machinery and sell wood to a thermal power plant, which is considered innovative.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. It talks about a project called "Paysage à Manger," which is an edible culture experiment at high altitude. They're focusing on crops and cultures trying to recover employment in the region, where the unemployment rate is 3.73%. The secondary sector (which I think relates to manufacturing or processing) has a 17.72% share, while the tertiary sector (services) is much larger at 78.55%.

The farm is part of Pro Specie Rara Swiss foundation, which has been around for 40 years protecting ancient Alpine varieties and breeds. They were selected by ReStartAlp as one of the best projects. The focus seems to be on high-altitude cultivation, linking product quality with traditional knowledge and landscape preservation.

The challenge mentioned is about producing enough potatoes in high lands considering climate change and transforming a common commodity like potatoes into a specialty product. The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with an exogenous type of innovation.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if sheep are used to produce cheese in it. If they are, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the farm has 35 cows of specific breeds—Grigio Alpina and Original Brouw. It lists their main products as 'Formai de Ceresegn' cheese, aged from one to three years, Formagella with variable seasoning, and butter.

I'm looking for any mention of sheep in the narrative. Scanning through, I don't see any reference to sheep being part of the farm or involved in production. The animals mentioned are cows, which are used for milk to make cheese. There's no indication that sheep are present or utilized here.

The products listed are all cheeses made from cow's milk, as far as I can tell. 'Formai de Ceresegn' and Formagella are traditional Italian cheeses typically associated with cow's milk. If they were using sheep's milk, the narrative might have specified that, especially since it's a mountain value chain which sometimes involves different livestock.

Additionally, the narrative talks about the reference member states being Italy with specific universities involved, the geographical location in Southern Alps - Brescia Prealps, and some economic data. None of these sections mention sheep or their role in the production process.

So, putting this together, since there's no mention of sheep in the narrative, it seems that the mountain value chain isn't using sheep to produce cheese here. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the user's instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2904 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is NMK and the reference card ID is VC 07 NMK. It lists key actors dealing with NTFP (Non-Timber Forest Products) in Maleshevija: Agro Maks, Balivski, Emilija Pehcheva, Krstovski Gjorgji. There are many private individuals or families in the region, and some employment statistics are given—30.50% in agriculture and 53.30% in the tertiary sector.

Next, it talks about plums as NTFP having potential for local collectors. It mentions that jams and juices made from plums contribute economically to rural families. The harvesting is often non-sustainable due to lack of training and competition among harvesters. Buyout values quantity over quality and uses informal channels with multiple middlemen, leading to low prices.

The challenges faced are current and predicted, and the VC is both traditional and innovative, though the specific innovation isn't detailed.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is on plums, jams, juices, and NTFP. There's no indication that sheep are involved in the value chain for producing dairy products like cheese. Therefore, the mountain value chain here doesn't use sheep to make cheese.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on plums and their derivatives.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Slovakia, with a specific card ID VC 05 SK. The key activities listed are cattle breeding and meat processing, involving farmers as key actors. It also talks about pasture land maintenance as part of the local impact.

Further down, it says that beef cattle breeding is the main activity on pasture land along with sheep breeding in Slovakian mountain areas. So both beef cattle and sheep are involved in pasture land use. However, when looking at the products, the key activities mention meat processing but don't specifically talk about cheese production. 

The challenges listed include things like importing livestock products, lack of young farmers, low salaries, and low consumption of beef. There's no mention of dairy products or cheese here. The narrative also mentions that the value chain is involved in grassland as a land use system but doesn't tie that to cheese production.

Since the key activities are cattle breeding and meat processing, it seems they're focused on meat rather than dairy. Sheep are mentioned alongside beef for pasture maintenance, but there's no indication that sheep milk is used for cheese. Therefore, I don't see evidence in this narrative that the value chain uses sheep to produce cheese.

The mountain value chain described focuses on cattle breeding and meat processing without mentioning cheese production from sheep.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if sheep are used to produce cheese in it. If they are, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 08 SCA. It describes Pultost as a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without rennet. They use a self-produced culture of lactic bacteria for coagulation. After draining, crumbling, and fermenting, salt and caraway seeds are added. The cheese can be eaten fresh or matured in wooden containers up to a year. Leftover cream is used for sour cream or butter.

Next, the narrative talks about the reference mountain chain being the Scandinavian Mountains - Scandes, specifically Lesja. It describes Lesja as a high mountainous area with Lesjaskogsvatnet lake and mentions that most of the municipality is above 900 masl. Traditional summer farms are located along the treeline, important for extensive traditional livestock systems during summer when animals graze in high altitude pastures.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative explicitly states that Pultost is made from cow's milk. There's no mention of sheep being used anywhere in the production process or as part of the livestock mentioned. While it does talk about traditional summer farms and extensive livestock systems, it doesn't specify which animals—only referring to grazing in pastures but not indicating sheep specifically.

I should also consider if there's any indirect reference to sheep. The mention of caraway seeds is just for flavor, so that doesn't tie into the animal aspect. The cheese production process is clearly outlined using cow's milk, and no other dairy sources are mentioned.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no indication that sheep are used in the production of this cheese. The focus is entirely on cows.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is 09 AT. It talks about hay milk produced by organic farmers who supply a regional dairy. The dairy processes this milk into various dairy products, which are sold under the label 'Zurück zum Ursprung' in supermarkets across Austria.

Looking for mentions of sheep or cheese production: I don't see any specific reference to sheep being used. Instead, it's about hay milk, which typically comes from cows. The dairy produces a range of dairy products but doesn't specify cheese made from sheep's milk. 

The narrative also discusses organic standards, quality control, and added value for the region, focusing on factors like regionality, animal welfare, environmental protection, etc., but again, no mention of sheep or cheese production.

Since there's no indication that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain, I should conclude that it's not involved. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2822 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Pelium Mountain in Greece and mentions activities like tourism, forest management, and farming. It highlights apple cultivation as a significant part of the local economy, with producers and their families relying on it for income. There's also mention of a cooperative that has introduced organic methods and innovations in marketing to support sustainability.

The narrative goes into detail about the area's natural beauty, including forests with various tree types like beech, oak, maple, chestnut, olive, apple, pear, and plane trees. It also notes nearby towns and the physical geography but doesn't mention anything related to sheep or dairy production.

I'm looking for any clues that sheep are involved in cheese production here. The narrative discusses apples a lot, which is more about fruit farming rather than livestock. There's no mention of sheep, goats, dairy farms, cheese-making processes, or related activities. Even though there are mentions of complementary activities like logging and apiculture (beekeeping), these don't relate to sheep or cheese.

So, based on the content provided, it doesn't seem like the mountain value chain in this narrative is involved with using sheep to produce cheese. The focus appears to be more on apple cultivation and forest-related activities.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2766 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state as the Czech Republic and a specific card ID. It mentions that producers aren't necessarily located in the mountains but collect products from there, focusing on credence goods. The symbolic origin is important for marketing.

Next, it describes the Sumava Mountains, their picturesque landscape, and how they've been partly abandoned during the socialist era but have seen farm renewals post-WWII. The region attracts tourists both in winter and summer. Producers here are beekeepers who use local ecosystems, branding their products with the mountain's name to emphasize origin and unique ecosystem.

The challenges faced by beekeepers include competition from large-scale producers, climate change affecting bee colonies, and fragmented sector issues. There's no mention of sheep or cheese production anywhere in this narrative.

So, since the entire focus is on beekeeping and honey-related products, there's no indication that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2905 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is NMK, with a specific card ID. It talks about private individuals and families involved in agriculture. The main focus seems to be on potatoes from Maleshevija mountain. They mention high-quality potatoes due to natural factors and a clean environment. These potatoes are sold across the country and recognized for their origin.

The narrative also points out that sometimes there's no clear branding or indication of product origin, with sales happening directly or through green markets. The challenges faced by this value chain are classified as Current and Predicted, and it's both Traditional and Innovative. However, the specific type of innovation isn't detailed beyond new products, processes, and marketing strategies.

Looking for any mention of sheep or cheese: I don't see either. It's all about potatoes. There's no indication that sheep are involved in this value chain, whether for dairy or any other product. The focus is solely on potato production and its market aspects.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain here isn't using sheep to produce cheese. They're dealing with potatoes exclusively.

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep or cheese production. It focuses on potatoes from Maleshevija mountain.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2842 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Hungary, with a specific card ID VC17 HU. It talks about homemade pasta free of additives and artificial substances, made from just flour and eggs. They produce raw materials almost entirely themselves and have sales channels. There are challenges related to labor supply and work ethic, classified as current and predicted issues.

The value chain is described as both traditional and innovative. The innovation types are endogenous and exogenous. Traditional activities include pasta preparation, hen keeping, and flour grinding. It's implemented by a social enterprise initiated by the local municipality to provide jobs and generate income. They produce large quantities of pasta sold in nearby grocery stores, packaged nicely, preservative-free, and healthy.

The land use systems are cropland and hen house, with local assets being natural and social.

Now, looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative doesn't talk about sheep at all. It's focused on pasta made from flour and eggs, hen keeping (which I assume refers to chickens for eggs), and flour grinding. There's no indication that they're using sheep milk or raising sheep for dairy products.

Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows, goats, or sheep. Since the narrative doesn't mention sheep or any dairy products beyond eggs, it seems they aren't involved in cheese making. The main product is pasta, which uses flour and eggs, not sheep's milk or other dairy components.

Therefore, based on the information given, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative ID 2974 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and mentions a Value Chain (VC) with ID VC15 UK. It discusses how Scottish heather is used for making honey and jewelry. Specifically, it says that the woody stems of heather provide no nutritional value for wildlife, so they're not used for that purpose.

The value chain is described as being endogenous and exogenous, innovative through traditional processes for heather jewelry and new marketing strategies like online stores and Etsy. The land use system involved is natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects. It also mentions examples of pressed flower jewelry in the UK by small producers on Etsy but notes that there aren't other examples of heather jewelry elsewhere.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative doesn't talk about sheep at all; it's focused on heather for honey and jewelry. There's no indication of dairy products, cheese, or any agricultural activities related to sheep. It seems the value chain is centered around heather-based products rather than livestock.

Therefore, since there's no information about sheep being used in this value chain for producing cheese, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Greece, with a specific card ID. It talks about prickly pear growing both wild and cultivated in Dicti mountainous terrain and on Crete. The focus here seems to be on prickly pear as a plant, its growth, and uses. 

It mentions that it's a new farming activity, so production of byproducts hasn't fully developed yet. The narrative points out that the prickly pear can be used for food for livestock, which could potentially lower costs for stockbreeders. However, there's not much consumer demand for this product. The challenges faced are current, and the VC is both traditional and innovative.

The type of innovation is endogenous, meaning it comes from within the local context. They're producing innovative products from a plant that hasn't been used much before. These products have high nutritional and economic value. It also mentions natural fertilizers being applied more in agriculture on Crete, which has a well-developed sector. There's something about pharmaceutical uses of prickly pear juices for treating diabetes.

The innovation relates to new products, processes, and possible ecological impacts. The land use systems involved are natural land, and the local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. Prickly pears grow in southern Spain, France, Greece, Italy, and Turkey.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative talks about using prickly pear for livestock feed but doesn't specify that it's used to produce cheese. It mentions stockbreeders, which could include shepherds, but without explicit connection to cheese-making. There's no direct link between the value chain and cheese production from sheep.

So, based on this, I don't see evidence that the mountain value chain is involved in using sheep for cheese. The focus seems more on prickly pear products, both as food for livestock and their other uses like pharmaceuticals.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 1, with a specific card ID. It describes an innovative small local producer of dried meat products. They work closely with local farmers and use old cows and other local products like 'AlpenP'—though I'm not sure what exactly 'AlpenP' refers to here.

It says the value chain is trying to "spruce up" a traditional VC, which might mean they're modernizing or innovating it. The narrative notes that the products are very meat-based and might not align with current trends. The challenges faced by this VC are classified as Predicted, and it's considered Innovative.

The type of innovation here is both Endogenous and Exogenous. That means the innovations come from within (endogenous) and also involve external factors (exogenous). Specifically, the narrative mentions that only the marketing style is innovative, with trendy branding and online marketing, which relates to new marketing strategies.

Looking at land use systems, it's Grassland. Local assets include Natural and Cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used to produce cheese here. The narrative talks about dried meat products and mentions using old cows and local products like 'AlpenP.' There's no mention of sheep or dairy products like cheese. It seems focused on meat production rather than dairy. Even though it's a mountain value chain, which often involves both meat and dairy, the specific details here don't include sheep for cheese.

So, based on this information, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative describes a value chain focused on dried meat products using old cows, with no mention of sheep or cheese production. Therefore, it does not involve using sheep to produce cheese.

It talks about farming in Bran commune being traditionally small-scale semi-subsistence pastoralism. Many households have diversified into some form of 'agro-touristic' activities, which includes both local and weekend visitors.

It goes on to describe that Bran has many attractions but faces issues due to overdevelopment. The area is well-located with good infrastructure, offering multi-purpose recreational resources. There are accommodations, restaurants, rustic-style agro-touristic farms, and second homes, most of which are new constructions. This development has led to the loss of traditional rural identity and discourages foreign visitors while still appealing to domestic ones.

The challenges mentioned are about managing continued development without negative impacts on their assets. The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation. Land use systems include Grassland, Forestry, and Natural land. Local assets are Natural and cultural.

Now, I need to check if sheep are used for cheese production. The narrative mentions farming but doesn't specify the type of livestock or products like cheese. It talks about agro-tourism and diversification but not specifically about dairy products or sheep being involved in any part of the value chain related to cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2810 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece, with a specific card ID VC 05 GR. It talks about vineyards owned by cooperative members and their families. The processing capacity is mentioned as 700 tons in 12 hours, which sounds like it's related to winemaking since they're talking about vinification.

Further down, it mentions that this is a farmers' co-operative involving 10 local villages, continuing a wine-production tradition for centuries. So far, everything points towards wine production, not cheese or sheep.

The narrative discusses challenges like sustainability and climate change affecting wine production levels and quality. It also talks about the cooperative's interest in new commercial presentations and products, including natural wines and innovative packaging like Tetra Pak. They've developed standardized wine in bag-in-box, referred to as "The Party's Wine."

Throughout the entire content, there's no mention of sheep or any dairy products. The focus is entirely on wine production—vineyards, vinification, processing capacity, challenges related to wine, and innovations in packaging and product types.

Since cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows, goats, or sheep, and given that this value chain is centered around wine, it's clear that sheep aren't involved here. The narrative doesn't touch on any dairy-related activities or products.

Therefore, the mountain value chain described isn't using sheep to produce cheese.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference mountain chain is Jura, which is in Switzerland. It talks about a cake produced by bakers and sold locally. The primary sectors involved are agriculture, specifically mentioning dairy resources. They use flour and cream made from dairy products, and there's a traditional method involving bacterial transformation of cream.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative doesn't explicitly say they're using sheep. It does talk about dairy resources but doesn't specify the type of animals used—sheep, cows, goats, etc. Since it's a mountain area in Switzerland, I know that cows are commonly used there for dairy products like cheese, such as Gruyère or Emmental. However, without explicit mention of sheep, I can't assume they're using them.

The focus here is on the cake production, which uses cream from dairy resources. There's no indication that the cheese itself is part of the value chain, only that the cream comes from dairy sources. So, while it's a dairy-based product, it doesn't specifically involve sheep for cheese-making.

Therefore, based solely on the given content without external knowledge, I can conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Hence, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Hungary, with a specific card ID. It lists key activities as collecting truffles, making special processed products, and organizing truffle collecting tours. So far, nothing about sheep or cheese production from them.

Next, it talks about employment sector shares in the province and region, which doesn't relate to sheep or cheese. Then there's a story about a young couple who moved to a village, collect truffles with their dogs, sell processed products like cheese stuffed with truffle, oil, salt, etc., and organize tours.

Wait, here it says they make processed products including cheese stuffed with truffle. But does that mean they're using sheep for the cheese? The narrative doesn't specify where the cheese comes from. It mentions using local ingredients but says using local artisanal cheese would raise prices too much, implying they might not be using sheep's milk cheese necessarily.

The key activities are about truffles, and while they make cheese products with truffle, there's no mention of sheep in their production process. They're focused on truffle collection and processing, not dairy farming or sheep herding.

So, the value chain is involved in making cheese products but doesn't indicate that sheep are part of it. Therefore, I shouldn't include an ID since they don't use sheep for producing cheese.

On top of that come the problems posed by the effects of climate change such as drought, late season frost, etc. In addition, while for the cultivation of blue berries stable production and quality via applying cultivation techniques can be assured, this does not apply for wild berry picking which is dependent on local climatic and soil conditions. Wild berries are not always easy to find and don't have the same characteristics over various season thereby not guaranteeing stable quality. Other challenges could lie in picking at the wrong moment (too soon or too late) or overpicking thereby damaging the sustainable use of this resource. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. There is no innovation in the picking of wild berries. Hand picking is done by traditional means. The only 'innovation' would be that the berries can be labelled as wild and 'from Nature' as opposed to their cultivated cousins.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2987 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID VC 06 SER. It talks about local wild berries being picked by locals to supplement their income. These are pure natural products dependent on the environment. They mention challenges like climate change effects such as drought and late frosts. The value chain is traditional, relying on local knowledge for terrai... I think that's a typo, maybe "terrain" strategies.

The narrative goes into detail about wild berries not being easy to find every season, leading to unstable production and quality. They also mention issues with picking at the wrong time or overpicking, which affects sustainability. The challenges are both current and predicted.

In terms of innovation, it's a mix of endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external). However, there's no real innovation in the picking process—it's still done traditionally by hand. The only possible innovation is labeling them as wild and natural compared to cultivated berries, but there's no further info on marketing techniques.

The land use systems involved are grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep for cheese production. From what I read, the focus is entirely on wild berries. There's nothing mentioned about sheep or any livestock. The products are natural but specifically related to berries, not dairy products like cheese. 

So, since there's no mention of sheep or cheese production in the narrative, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for that purpose.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing cheese.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Narrative Analysis:** The narrative centers around wild berry picking as part of a traditional value chain in Serbia.
2. **Key Elements Identified:** Focus is on natural products, local practices, and challenges related to climate and sustainability.
3. **Innovation Aspect:** No mention of sheep or dairy production; innovation relates to labeling wild berries.
4. **Conclusion:** The narrative does not involve sheep or cheese production.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary with a specific card ID. It describes a rural museum with guided tours featuring various mills like grain, paper, and oil. There's also a bakery using flowers from the mill. The café sells baked goods and hosts events like festivals and workshops. They make custom T-shirts and bags too.

The innovation here is about interpreting past culture in a working museum set in a beautiful natural area with lakes and forests, which makes it a prime tourism spot. However, they face challenges like labor shortages for traditional jobs, difficulty finding quality grains, needing better social media presence, and loss of visitors during the pandemic. They also struggle with maintaining buildings and equipment and generating enough income.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative talks about mills, a bakery, and selling delicacies but doesn't specify what those are. There's no indication that sheep are involved in any part of this value chain—whether it's for milk, wool, or meat. Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows or goats, not sheep, unless specified.

Since there's no mention of sheep or cheese in the narrative, I can conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.
</think>

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production. It focuses on a rural museum with mills and a bakery, without any reference to sheep-based dairy products.

The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The invention of 'Styria Beef' was a reaction due to the lack of quality beef products in the late 1980s in Austria. Styria beef has not only been representing itself as a new brand, but has set new standards in regard to animal welfare (suckler cow husbandry) that are now common in mountain farming practices in Austria. The innovation is related to New product and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural and social.   There are some farmers from the neighbouring federal states of Carinthia and Lower Austria supplying Styria beef.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID is 2726, so that's important for the response. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Austria and the product in question is 'Styria beef.' It talks about organic farmers from Styria producing premium beef available on-farm, small shops, and high-end restaurants.

I notice that the challenges faced are both current and predicted, and the value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative. The innovation here revolves around new products and marketing strategies, specifically mentioning animal welfare practices like suckler cow husbandry. Land use systems involved are pasture farming, with local assets being natural and social.

Now, looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The narrative doesn't talk about sheep at all; it's focused on beef. There's no indication that the value chain uses sheep for dairy products or cheese. It's all about beef production and marketing.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain in question isn't involved with using sheep to produce cheese. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the user's instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the lead product is ALMO, which stands for Almo Steirisches Almochsenfleisch. That translates to something like "Alpine Chosen Beef," I think. It's a label for quality ox products protected as a word mark. So, it's focused on beef from oxen.

The narrative talks about traditional pasture farming with high animal welfare standards, involving cooperation with an Austrian animal welfare NGO. They mention various actors in the value chain like farmers, veterinarians, butchers, retailers, tourism, and regional development agencies. Innovations include their own regional slaughterhouse that works with sheep farmers, free-range pig farmers, and local butchers to enhance regional value creation.

Wait, so they have a slaughterhouse that collaborates with sheep farmers? That might mean they're using sheep for meat production. But the question is about cheese production. Cheese typically comes from milk, usually from cows or goats, less commonly from sheep. The narrative doesn't mention anything about dairy products, cheese, or milk processing.

The lead product is beef, and while they work with sheep farmers, it's in the context of slaughterhouse cooperation, which suggests meat, not dairy. There's no indication that the sheep are being used for their milk to make cheese. Instead, the focus seems to be on meat production and landscape preservation through pasture farming.

So, putting this together, the value chain is involved with sheep but for meat, not cheese. Therefore, they're not using sheep to produce cheese.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 is focused on beef production (ALMO) and involves sheep farmers in their slaughterhouse operations, but there's no mention of cheese production.

Alhough this product is not unique of mountain regions, it is a great example of utilizing natural and symbolic values associated with the region. In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the liquers are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area. The symbolic value refering to the mountains is what distingusihes the product from other similar products.    Herb liquers are sold on mainstream food markets

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2765 involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is based in the Czech Republic and focuses on producing herb liquers. It's noted that these liquers are niche products, not mainstream, and they're marketed as regional items using symbolic assets of the area. 

Looking at the details, the VC utilizes natural and symbolic values associated with the region to create a unique selling proposition. They emphasize traditional knowledge and cultural traits linked to the mountain area in their marketing. The liquers are sold on mainstream food markets.

Now, I need to check if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or dairy products like cheese. Instead, it's all about herb liquers, which are alcoholic beverages made from herbs. There's no indication that the production process involves sheep or any dairy ingredients.

Additionally, the sectors mentioned (primary, secondary, tertiary) relate to employment but don't specify the types of agricultural activities beyond what's necessary for producing the liquers. Since the focus is on herbs and not livestock, it's safe to conclude that sheep aren't part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no mention of sheep or cheese production in the narrative, I should return an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2724 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is VC 19 AT. It talks about a cooperative providing an income basis for mountain farmers, which relates to the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape during the summer grazing period. So, they're talking about using the land for grazing, but I don't see any mention of sheep specifically.

Next, it mentions that the VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with innovations in new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. The land use systems include cropland, grassland, forestry, natural land, and pasture farming. Local assets are natural, social, and cultural. 

The narrative also discusses the cooperative's structure and governance but doesn't provide specific details about their products or livestock. It does say that Bio vom Berg exists since 2002 as a brand of the BioAlpin cooperative, focusing on production coordination and new product development to secure farmer income.

However, there's no explicit mention of sheep being used for cheese production. The focus seems more on the cooperative's structure, governance, and land use rather than specific agricultural products like cheese made from sheep's milk. 

So, based solely on the content provided, I don't see any indication that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is Italy, specifically UNIMOL and UNIPI. It talks about a farm raising 120 Duroc pigs on open air and processing their meat into cured meats sold at local markets. There's mention of collaboration with other breeders in Vottignasco, and the challenges faced are current, classifying it as innovative with exogenous innovation.

The key points here are that they're dealing with pigs, not sheep. The farm processes pig meat into cured products like ham or sausages, which are sold locally. There's no mention of dairy production, cheese-making, or any involvement with sheep in the narrative. 

Sheep are typically associated with dairy products like cheese, especially in mountainous regions where sheep farming is common. However, this VC focuses on pigs and meat processing. The innovation mentioned revolves around the health of the pigs in open pastures and natural production methods without additives.

Since there's no indication that sheep are involved or that cheese is being produced, I can conclude that this value chain isn't using sheep for cheese production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2878 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a cooperative called Mila, which is focused on the South Tyrolean dairy industry. It mentions that they have a large family of mountain farmers and employees, aiming to uphold high-quality products. The primary sector share is 6.72%, secondary is 20.33%, and tertiary is 72.95%. 

Mila guarantees secured continuity for mountain farming and ensures quality products with the best milk prices. They take care of milk producers in the mountains, working harmoniously with nature and focusing on animal welfare and resource handling.

The market is competitive, so they innovate to stay competitive. The type of challenge is current, and the VC is classified as innovative, specifically exogenous. Mila was the first producer of SKYR in Italy, which comes from Iceland. SKYR is described as a dairy specialty made with selected ingredients and 100% hay milk from South Tyrolean mountains, high in proteins and low in fat.

Now, the question is whether sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative mentions "hay milk," but it doesn't specify which animal provides this milk. Typically, hay milk refers to cow's milk, as cows are commonly associated with dairy production. However, sheep can also produce milk used for cheeses like feta or pecorino.

But looking at the details, SKYR is a specific product from Iceland, and while it's made from dairy, the narrative doesn't mention sheep specifically. It talks about mountain farmers but doesn't clarify if they're using sheep or cows. Since Mila is a dairy cooperative, their primary source is likely cow's milk unless stated otherwise.

Therefore, based on the information given, there's no explicit mention of sheep being used in the production of cheese for this value chain.
</think>

The narrative does not explicitly mention the use of sheep in producing cheese; it focuses on hay milk without specifying the animal source. Typically, hay milk refers to cows, and Mila is a dairy cooperative likely using cow's milk.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return the ID of the narrative in a JSON format; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions Linbul Farm as an innovative farm enterprise in Bulgaria, specifically in the Berkovitsa Municipality. The narrative talks about their grazing practices with an Aberdeen Angus suckler herd on rough high altitude pastures. 

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The term "sheep" isn't present anywhere in the text. Instead, it's focused on cattle—Aberdeen Angus cows. They're using these cows for grazing, which suggests they might be involved in beef production rather than dairy or cheese.

Additionally, the narrative highlights new products and innovative management practices but doesn't specify what those products are. Without explicit mention of sheep or cheese, I can't assume that cheese is being produced here. The focus seems to be on a unique value chain involving cattle grazing in high-altitude areas.

I should also consider if there's any indirect indication. For example, sometimes milk from cows can be used for cheese, but the narrative doesn't specify that. It mainly emphasizes the suckler herd, which is typically raised for beef rather than dairy purposes.

Given all this, it seems clear that sheep aren't involved in producing cheese here. The value chain revolves around cattle grazing and innovative farming techniques without mentioning any dairy products or sheep.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland, with a specific VC ID of VC 10 CH1. It talks about a major beer brand called 'Appenzellerbier' which uses barley from mountain regions and many smaller breweries producing various types of beer. The sector's employment impact isn't specified.

It mentions innovative use of mountain grain, using traditional varieties, and craft beers becoming popular in the last 10 years. They're targeting younger customers differently than traditional alpine products. There are challenges related to water scarcity, classified as a predicted issue. The value chain is considered Innovative, with both endogenous and exogenous innovation types.

The innovation here revolves around new products (like mountain beers) and new marketing strategies. Land use systems involved are cropland, and local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, the key point: does this involve sheep for cheese? The narrative doesn't mention sheep at all. It's focused on barley production for beer, not dairy or cheesemaking. There's no reference to livestock, cheese production, or any dairy-related activities. All the products discussed are beers made from grain, not cheeses from sheep's milk.

So, based on this, the mountain value chain in narrative 3107 isn't involved with using sheep to produce cheese.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing cheese. It focuses on barley production and craft beer manufacturing.

Urbanization is a major challenge, since the village has become a tourist attraction leading to the construction of new housing and buildings.

Techniques of pottery production are mostly traditional and date back to the Neolithic period. The innovations concern: 
a. new products. While in the past, the focus was on products of practical utility, in the present more and more products (souvenirs) of decorative use are constructed. 
b. new processes (mix of innovative (e.g. use of blue glaze) and traditional techniques (e.g. use of potter wheel).

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece, specifically referencing VC 12 GR. The key activities listed include collecting raw materials, sifting out small stones, leaving them in the sun, and laying them in plastic bags. These steps sound like part of a production process, but I'm not sure what exactly they're producing yet.

The narrative then talks about cal and tourist consumption. Cal could refer to a type of cheese, but it's more commonly associated with sheep's milk products. However, the next part mentions governmental measures related to COVID-19 reducing tourism, which affects the village of Margarites. The challenges include urbanization due to tourism and potters seeking supplementary income during winter months.

Further reading reveals that this value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovations mentioned are new products (like souvenirs) and processes involving a mix of traditional and innovative techniques, such as using blue glaze and potter wheels. This suggests the focus is on pottery and ceramics rather than dairy production.

The narrative also mentions "Psiloritis UNESCO Global Geopark" and its role in conservation and sustainable tourism. It emphasizes natural traditions and cultural knowledge related to Margarites Village Pottery and Ceramics.

Putting it all together, the activities described are centered around pottery and ceramic goods, not cheese production. There's no mention of sheep or dairy products anywhere in the narrative. Therefore, this value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Spain UCO, with a specific card ID. It talks about six main types of cheeses from three provinces and highlights blue cheeses as significant. The primary sector employment is 4.10%, secondary 19.80%, tertiary 76.10%. There are four PDOs and two PGIs, which are quality certifications.

Then it says the cattle graze in common mountain pastures within a National Park. It mentions cheeses as part of cultural heritage and tourism. Challenges include abandonment of traditional practices like shepherds and cheesemaking, low production, and scarce marketing strategies. The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with exogenous innovation related to e-commerce and certifications.

Wait, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep. It talks about cattle grazing in pastures. So, if they're using cows instead of sheep, then sheep aren't involved in producing cheese here. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't using sheep for cheese production.
</think>

The narrative does not mention sheep; it refers to cattle grazing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. It talks about a closed supply chain where they take care of animals from their first day of life. They have their own feed mill, which is used to satisfy all the animals' needs. Then it mentions that eggs are collected daily in different production systems (traditional, on land, BIO) and transported to the market.

Next, it refers to the mountain chain as the Cottian Alps and the specific area Dronero in Piemonte, Italy. The details about Dronero include its location, size, altitude, population stats, and economic activities like breeding and cultivating apples, peaches, and kiwis. It also mentions the average per capita income and Gross Value Added.

Now, looking for clues related to sheep and cheese production. The narrative talks about animals being taken care of from day one and producing their own feed. However, it specifically mentions eggs being collected and transported. There's no direct mention of sheep or cheese production anywhere in the text. The focus seems to be more on egg production and agricultural activities like fruit cultivation.

So, based on this information, I don't see any indication that the value chain involves using sheep for cheese. They're handling animals but it's not specified whether they're sheep, and the main products mentioned are eggs and fruits.
</think>

The narrative does not mention the use of sheep or cheese production. It focuses on egg production and fruit cultivation.

Deer are synonymous with Scotland's mountainous areas and due to a lack of larger predators are thus managed for better land management. 50 Deer Management groups exist in Scotland made up of multiple landowners, gamekeepers etc. The venison VC interacts with the sporting game VC. New products (charcuterie meats) are created through new processes (i.e. drying and curring the venison) adopted from outside of Scotland. Furthermore, Great Glen Charcuterie use 100% venison meat (and nothing else) in their products. They also now sell their produce at delis, restaurants and farm shops across Scotland.   Natural: venison requires mountainous and 'wild' terrain for venison production as well as attractive landscape and scenery to add to the 'venison brand' (i.e. iconic views of Scotland). Vension production/ deer management requires a lot of cooperation across land owners, gamekeepers, tourist ventures, local communities, conservation groups etc. There are around 50 Deer Management groups in Scotland established for this cooperation.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference card ID is VC 25 UK. It talks about Scotland being the UK's largest venison producer, with both wild and farmed venison production numbers. There are details about deer farms and management groups, which suggests this value chain is focused on venison.

The narrative mentions that new products like charcuterie meats are created through processes such as drying and curing, using 100% venison meat. They sell these products in various places across Scotland. It also discusses the natural aspects of venison production, requiring mountainous terrain and scenic landscapes to enhance the brand. There's a focus on cooperation among landowners, gamekeepers, local communities, etc., through Deer Management groups.

Cultural assets include traditional knowledge for culling and processing practices, linking to Scotland's heritage with the deer as "the monarch of the glen." The narrative also touches on communication within the value chain and dependencies like exports, which could be affected by events like Brexit.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about venison—production, processing, marketing, and the associated management and cultural aspects. So, since the focus is entirely on deer and venison, not sheep or dairy products, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON object because the criteria aren't met.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Slovakia, with a specific card ID VC 17 SK. The activities listed are collection of juniper berries, drink preparation, and marketing. Key actors include forest owners, drink producers, and consumers. 

The positive impact is on local and regional SES, but there's a challenge related to importing juniper berries from other countries like Albania. It's classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Forestry, and Meadows. Local assets include Natural and cultural aspects.

Looking at the activities: collection of juniper berries suggests they're making something from those berries, possibly a drink. The key actors are forest owners, which makes sense if they have access to juniper bushes on their land. Drink producers would then process these berries into some beverage. 

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or cheese production. The activities revolve around juniper berries and drinks, not dairy products or livestock. Even though Meadows are mentioned as a land use system, which could be where sheep might graze, the specific activities don't involve sheep for cheese.

So, based on the information given, this value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese. They're focused on juniper berries and drink production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2986 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Scotland Hutton and a Card ID VC 28 UK. It mentions breakfast puddings like haggis and Stornoway black pudding as important Scottish exports. The export value for haggis is given as £8.8 million, which suggests it's a significant product.

Looking at the assets, there are strong social links between farmers, butchers, and tourism providers. Cultural aspects include traditional knowledge about pudding production, crofting, and livestock farming. It also notes that these products are cultural icons for the Scottish food industry.

The narrative mentions reliance on tourism for market sales and potential challenges from Brexit or COVID. There's a focus on maintaining land use and climate suitability for livestock farming, with possible impacts from climate change. Only Stornoway black pudding has PGI status, while others might be at risk from imitators. It also points out that black pudding is made in Lancaster LAU1.

The VC is classified as Traditional, with unspecified innovation but existing for many years. Land use systems include grassland and natural land, with local assets being natural, social, and cultural. Haggis and other puddings are made throughout Scotland, including non-upland areas, though Stornoway's is the only one with PGI.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used in producing cheese here. The narrative discusses haggis and black pudding, which are meat-based products, typically containing sheep's offal. However, it doesn't mention cheese production at all. Cheese would require milk from sheep or other animals, but there's no indication of dairy processing in this VC.

Therefore, since the focus is on meat puddings and not cheese made from sheep's milk, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing cheese. The narrative focuses on haggis and black pudding, which are meat-based products, rather than dairy products like cheese.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic, with a card ID VC 06 CZ. It talks about chicken husbandry being present on many farms in the mountain region. Some farms specialize directly in chicken meat production, keeping chickens for meat. The challenges mentioned are related to profitability and animal welfare, especially for small-scale farms. These farms are important for promoting local food production.

It also notes that since chicken husbandry doesn't rely much on land, these farms can be located in mountain regions where arable land is scarce. The value chain is classified as Traditional because it uses established farm practices, though the innovation aspect isn't specified. Local assets include cultural aspects, but there's no mention of sheep or cheese production.

So, looking through all this information, I don't see any reference to sheep being used in the value chain. It's all about chicken husbandry and meat production. There's nothing about dairy products like cheese, nor is there any indication that sheep are involved in this particular value chain. Therefore, it seems clear that this mountain value chain isn't using sheep for cheese production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2827 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a gastro-village that's successful because of fine-dining restaurants, wineries, and cafes. It mentions innovation in processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. The land use includes cropland for grapes by wineries, but the restaurants don't directly use land beyond that—they rely on producers.

Nowhere in this description do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is more on tourism through food and wine rather than dairy products from sheep. So, it seems like the value chain isn't involved with sheep for cheese.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on wineries and restaurants.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2829 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a social employment program initiated by the local government in Hungary. The members involved are from poor, unemployed groups, including Roma. They're producing pumpkin seeds and processing them into different products. There's mention of a small processing plant with solar drying equipment, branding, design, and a shop. They use short food chains for distribution.

The value chain involves cultivating pumpkins for seed oil and herbs. The focus is on natural resources, local cooperation, and support from the municipality. They also address challenges related to climate change like droughts and extreme weather.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about pumpkin seeds, their processing into oil, and other vegetable/herb products. There's no indication that dairy products or sheep are part of this value chain.

So, based on the content given, the mountain value chain isn't involved with using sheep to make cheese.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2782. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France CCVD and the value chain's card ID is VC 07 FR1. It talks about Picodon AOP being a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region. That's interesting because it specifies goat milk, not sheep.

Next, I'll look for any mention of sheep or other dairy sources. The narrative describes different areas in Drôme: North-East with middle and high mountains where agriculture is mainly livestock and small gardening. However, it doesn't specify what kind of livestock—sheep, cows, goats? It just says "livestock," which could include various animals.

The South part mentions aromatic and large crops, while the West has plains with large croplands. The Biovallée territory gathers municipalities but again, no specific mention of sheep or cheese production from them.

Looking further, there's a lot about geography, population stats, income levels, etc., but nothing that ties back to sheep being used for cheese. Picodon is clearly a goat-milk cheese, so unless there's another product mentioned, I can't assume they use sheep here.

I should also consider if the term "livestock" might include sheep, but without explicit mention, it's safer not to assume. The user wants an exact match where sheep are used for cheese production. Since Picodon is goat-based and no other cheeses are mentioned, I shouldn't infer that sheep are involved.

Therefore, based on the given content, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, with a card ID of VC 10 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in cultivated pastures and open pastures around farms in Dagalifjell during the grazing season from May to October. In winter, the animals are kept indoors.

I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The text specifically says "cattle graze," so it's talking about cows, not sheep. There's no information about sheep being part of this value chain. Also, while cheese is a dairy product, since they're using cattle, it would likely be cow's milk cheese, not related to sheep.

Therefore, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in using sheep for cheese production.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece, specifically Rethymno prefecture. The value chain (VC) is centered around carob cultivation in the Selli area. It involves local farmers and family firms producing various carob products and by-products for international markets. They face competition from other Mediterranean countries.

The VC is classified as both traditional and innovative. The innovations mentioned are organic cultivation, integrated production management, and creating new products like carob powder used as a coffee substitute and flour. There's also mention of land use systems involving forestry and natural land, with local assets being natural, social, and cultural.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any reference to sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on carob cultivation and its derivatives. So, the value chain isn't involved in using sheep for cheese.

The VC uses locally available lands for organic garlic growing and has good connections with agricultural producers and the local LEADER LAG for marketing and community actions.

There are mentions of labor shortages and competition from Chinese garlic due to global trends. It's noted as a new production line in the area, made possible by climate change, but there's some lack of knowledge and experience.

Now, looking through all this information, I don't see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on organic garlic. There's no indication that sheep are involved in any part of this value chain—whether it's for milk, wool, or any other product related to sheep. Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows or goats, but sheep as well. Since there's nothing about dairy products here, I can confidently say that the mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep to produce cheese.

Therefore, according to the instructions, if the value chain isn't involved in sheep cheese production, I should return an empty JSON object.

The narrative talks about a cooperative in Greece, specifically in Gergeri, Crete. It mentions that their products are under quality standards and they maintain a tavern for social events. They sell products online, which include items related to Cretan cuisine and heritage. The raw materials come from local natural resources like grassland.

Nowhere in the narrative does it explicitly mention sheep or cheese production. They do talk about using local natural resources but don't specify what animals they use. It's more focused on the impact of the cooperative on the community, especially empowering women, rather than detailing their production methods.

So, based on this, I can't confirm that sheep are used to produce cheese in this value chain. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3032 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with Slovakia as the reference member state and the VC ID being VC 06 SK. The key activities listed are farm production, accommodation, food provision, and marketing. Key actors include farmers, visitors, and local public authorities. 

Looking at the local and regional impact, it mentions that the farm produces high-quality food products, sometimes with bio certification, and provides accommodation for visitors. It also notes new services on a farm, which might include things like agrotourism.

The challenges mentioned are the lack of tradition in agrotourism due to past collectivization during the communist regime, the need for additional skills beyond farming for agrotourism, and initial investment requirements. The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with the innovation being exogenous—meaning it's a new service on the farm related to tourism.

The land use systems involved are cropland and grassland, which are typical for agriculture. Local assets include natural (agricultural land) and social (farmers' skills).

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus seems to be more on agrotourism services rather than dairy products. There's no indication that the VC involves using sheep for making cheese; instead, it's about diversifying farming activities into tourism.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 3032 is not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with Switzerland as the reference member state. It mentions a malthouse with 34 members, including farmers, breweries, and others interested in regional brewing. So, this seems focused on barley processing for malt and beer production.

Next, it refers to the mountain chain as Jura and lists several landscapes. The region has limestone rocks, shallow valleys, high plateaus, forests, and wooded pastures. It mentions that milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resources of the massif. So, dairy is a key part here.

It also talks about clock-making by farmers since the Middle Ages, which is cultural but not directly related to sheep or cheese. The environmental details include temperature variations, abundant rainfall, and population statistics, but these don't mention sheep specifically.

Nowhere in the narrative does it explicitly say that sheep are used for producing cheese. It mentions milk and cheese production as the primary agricultural resource, but doesn't specify the type of livestock involved. While sheep are common in dairy production, especially in mountainous regions, the text doesn't confirm their use here.

Therefore, based solely on the given content, there's no direct evidence that sheep are used to produce cheese in this value chain.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a narrative about a mountain value chain with ID 3011. My task is to determine if this value chain involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON object containing the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 05 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in open pastures during summer and being covered by snow the rest of the year. There's a mention of another important element related to "cutivat" which seems like it might be a typo or incomplete word.

The narrative goes on with various statistics: regional share of BPs/year, number of agricultural holdings, distance to the nearest settlement, protected areas, and sector shares of employment in both province and region. It also discusses the cultural component of the value chain, its role in conservation, new products linked to tourism, marketing strategies involving cooperation, regional brands, and e-commerce.

It highlights that mountain pastures and climatic conditions require specific management techniques and commitment. Practices, knowledge, farm architecture, landscapes, and products are part of the cultural heritage. There's also a social component from stakeholder cooperation.

The challenges listed include competing meat industries, accessing markets, and adding value due to lower production capacity.

Now, I need to check if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative mentions cattle grazing but doesn't explicitly mention sheep. Cheese can be made from various sources like cow's milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk. However, the text only talks about cattle and their management. There's no indication of sheep being part of this value chain.

Additionally, the focus seems to be on meat production as one of the challenges is competing with the meat industry. While cheese could be a product, the narrative doesn't specify that sheep are used for milk or cheese production. It emphasizes conservation of pastures and cultural heritage related to farming practices but without mentioning sheep.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this mountain value chain.

Horezu is the only centre of ceramic production in Romania in which this trade remains the main source of income for a significant number of local families.   The traditional knowledge and craftsmanship associated with the pottery have been inscribed on the UNESCO list of 'Intangible Cultural Heritage' since 2012 (https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/craftsmanship-of-horezu-ceramics-00610) thereby indicating the existence of a craft-based cultural value chain in addition to the product value chain. This cultural value chain also gives the community a sense of identity, while also providing a day-to-day social function.    Most of the ceramics are sold locally in the galleries of individual families. Tourists and day-trippers are the main customers and for many years have provided a stable demand for the local ceramics and a guarenteed source of income. However, the covid crisis has highlighted that this traditional method of direct sales can be severly interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the pottery families. The challenge now is to develop more robust value chains for marketing these very traditional mountain products and there is growing interest in online sales, plus the possibility of some form of cooperation between families to access better establ

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2957 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Romania is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC), specifically VC 16 RO. It talks about production being divided between men and women, with each respecting a specific sequence of operations. The men are referred to as potters who select and dig earth for pottery. 

Next, it mentions employment rates in the region and discusses traditional Romanian pottery made by hand around Horezu town. This includes painted clay pots and plates, which are significant sources of income for local families. It also notes that this pottery is recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage since 2012.

The narrative goes on to explain how most ceramics are sold locally in family galleries, with tourists being the main customers. However, it points out challenges faced during the COVID crisis, particularly regarding direct sales and the need for more robust marketing strategies, including online sales and potential cooperation between families.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of sheep or cheese production. The entire narrative is focused on pottery—how it's made, its cultural significance, and the economic aspects related to selling these ceramics. There's no reference to dairy products, sheep farming, or cheese-making anywhere in the text. 

Therefore, since the value chain here revolves around ceramic production rather than dairy or agriculture involving sheep, I can conclude that this mountain value chain is not involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on traditional pottery.

However, other retailers are used moderately in product sales. It is seen that the farmers also sell pears directly to the hotels since it is in the tourism region of Korkuteli. However, direct sales are very low. One of the marketing channels used less frequently by the farmers is the brokers in the wholesale market. Although Karyağdı Pear is a quality product, there is no awareness regarding the product. In other words, there are problems in generating demand. In 2018, a geographical indication certificate was obtained for Karyağdı Pear. It is expected that the geographical indication will help increase the demand of Karyağdı Pear.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3153 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state Turkey and reference card ID VC 06 TR. It discusses Karyağdı Pear, which is a product from the region of Korkuteli in Antalya Province. The focus here is on marketing channels for pears, such as local merchants, non-local merchants, companies, hotels, and some mention of brokers in wholesale markets.

The narrative also mentions that the reference mountain chain is the Bey mountains in Antalya, with the landscape being Korkuteli. It highlights issues like lack of demand awareness, obtaining a geographical indication certificate for the pears, and the absence of a farmer organization.

Nowhere in this content do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The primary product discussed is pears, specifically Karyağdı Pear. There's no indication that sheep are involved in this value chain, whether it's for dairy products like cheese or any other use related to sheep.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't involve sheep or cheese production, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 2955 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that 'Pastrama de Oaie' is produced from boneless mutton, which comes from sheepmeat. It's preserved and smoked according to a special recipe with a characteristic aroma and taste. So, it's clear that sheep are involved here because they're the source of the meat used in this product.

However, I'm looking for whether the value chain is involved in producing cheese. The term 'Pastrama de Oaie' refers to a smoked meat product, not cheese. Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows or goats, whereas mutton is meat. There's no mention of cheese-making processes, dairy products, or any transformation of sheep's milk into cheese.

Additionally, the narrative talks about processing requests for using the OQT and the 'Mountain Products' logo, which are handled by local offices and a national authority. This part doesn't relate to cheese production either; it's more about regulation and certification of mountain products in general.

So, while sheep are definitely involved in this value chain through their meat, there's no indication that they're used for making cheese. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from sheep.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2970 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and mentions a PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) product called Scotch beef. It explains that Scotch beef is awarded this status if produced in Scotland under specific conditions: reared, slaughtered, and dressed there. The focus here is on maintaining the PGI status through environmental schemes and grazing of common land.

It also discusses the creation of a local abattoir to shorten supply chains and reduce environmental impact. Then it moves on to natural assets, emphasizing the importance of landscape maintenance for Scotch beef production and improving natural resources. Social assets are highlighted as strong relationships within the value chain, including cattle farmers who use upland common grazing areas. There's mention of a recent Scotch Beef Monitor Farm Project in Skye and Lochalsh that has strengthened these social ties.

Cultural assets involve traditional knowledge and practices for quality beef production. The narrative then addresses potential challenges like high costs, competition, disease outbreaks (like Bovine TB or foot and mouth), and climate change impacts on grazing areas.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep being used to produce cheese. It's all about cattle and beef production. There's no indication of dairy products, cheese, or the use of sheep at all. The focus is solely on Scotch beef, its production methods, and the associated challenges and assets related to that specific product.

Therefore, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 2970 does not involve using sheep to produce cheese.

The very specific natural asset used to produce Strandzhanski manov med (Manna honey) is the Natura 2000 designated oak forests of the Strandzha mountains in the south of Burgas Province. Due to their proximity to the Black, Marmara and Aegean Seas, the Strandzha mountains have relatively high air humidity and mild temperatures which, combined with the local soil conditions, creates a very specific flora in the oak forests.    As in most other countries, there is growing concern amongst Bulgarian bee-keepers about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources. The long-term effects of climate change and climate variability remain unknown but are likely to have negative impacts upon productivity of honeybees.

The social asset here is represented by the PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), which brings producers together. Rakfish is consumed all along Norway and has a unique traditional fermentation method in Europe. The narrative also discusses challenges related to climate change, such as changes in water stream regimes, increased precipitation, decreased snow cover, and rising temperatures affecting trout populations.

Further on, the value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation mentioned is exogenous, specifically an e-commerce platform. They no longer use traditional wooden barrels for curing but maintain other traditional methods. Another innovation is that this Rakfish was the first to get a Norwegian Specialty of Food Label and one of the first fish products with PDO certification before 2003 when regulations didn't allow it. The narrative also notes new marketing strategies as part of the innovation.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Bulgaria, with a specific card ID VC 01 BG. It talks about sustainable use of medicinal plants in the Central Balkan National Park. There's a list of various herbs and plants like thyme, St. John's wort, raspberry, etc., which are used in alternative medicine.

The narrative goes on to discuss challenges related to wild collected foods—correct identification, contamination, quality standards, and sustainable harvesting. It mentions that overexploitation is a problem and there have been initiatives to address this. The value chain is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type.

Now, I need to check if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. From the content given, the focus is entirely on medicinal plants and wild collected foods. There's no mention of livestock, sheep, dairy products, or cheese production anywhere in the narrative. All the species listed are herbs, berries, and other plant-based resources.

So, based solely on the provided context without any external knowledge, there's no indication that this value chain uses sheep for cheese production. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Italy VINIDEA, and the value chain pertains to organic production of champenois wines by Ferrari company. They process grapes from their own farms and about 300 small farmers in the area. There's a mention of climate change impact studies and moving vineyards to areas previously not suitable.

Looking further, the reference mountain chain is Eastern Alps, specifically Trento, which is known for its alpine landscape. The narrative talks about agriculture shifting from higher areas where animal husbandry was common to focusing more on plant production like grapes, apples, berries, and vegetables. Tourism is also highlighted as important due to environmental quality.

Now, the key point here is whether sheep are involved in producing cheese. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or dairy products. It's all about wine production—grapes, vineyards, climate studies, and plant-based agriculture. There's no indication of animal husbandry beyond traditional practices that are being abandoned.

So, based on the content provided, there's no involvement with sheep for cheese production. The value chain is centered around wine, not dairy products. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is PORTUGAL ESTRELA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 PT2. Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric. Different Burel Products such as wall panels, carpets, curtains, cushion covers, poufs and benches, suitcases, backpacks, footwear and clothing items are produced and then sold locally, nationally and internationally.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrela and the VC ID is 17 PT2. It talks about wool being used in the production of Burel, which comes from specific sheep breeds like Bordaleira Serra da Estrela, Churra Mondegueira, and Portuguese Merino. The process involves shearing the sheep, using the best quality wool for textiles, spinning it into yarn, weaving, and then treating it with a machine called Pisão to make Burel fabric.

Burel is described as more resistant than regular wool fabric, and they make various products from it like clothing, furniture, and accessories. The reference mountain chain is Cordilheira Central (RR08), located in Manteigas, which has beautiful landscapes and a historical context.

Now, the question is whether this value chain uses sheep to produce cheese. From the narrative, all the mentions of sheep are related to wool production for textiles. There's no mention of dairy products or cheese-making. The focus is on wool processing into Burel fabric and then manufacturing goods from that fabric.

So, since the narrative doesn't talk about using sheep milk or any dairy processes, it seems like they're not involved in cheese production. They’re focused on wool for textiles and related products.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep to produce cheese. The focus is on wool processing into Burel fabric and manufacturing goods from that fabric.

The land use is described as a mountainous village with social and cultural assets. Local mayors and authorities support these innovations through policies.

Nowhere in this narrative do they specifically mention sheep or cheese production. It's more about general agricultural practices and community efforts without pointing to any particular product like cheese made from sheep's milk.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 2954 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania, specifically referring to 'Brănză Horezu' cheese produced in Horezu town. It was first made there in 2001. The key point here is about the milk used for cheese production: it says "All milk used for cheese production is collected d." Wait, that seems cut off. Maybe it's supposed to say something like "from dairy sheep" or another source? But as it stands, the text only mentions that all milk is collected but doesn't specify the type of animal.

The narrative also talks about an authority regulating the market for 'Mountain Products' and ensuring producers have authorization and proper labeling. This suggests regulation around cheese production but again, no mention of sheep specifically.

So, based on the information given, there's no explicit indication that sheep are involved in producing the cheese. The content doesn't specify whether it's cow's milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk. Without that detail, I can't confirm that sheep are part of this value chain for cheese production.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Serbia, with a specific card ID. It says that livestock husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the Pester plateau area. The key product here is beef meat, as it's at the basis of the value chain. They have cattle farms solely for beef production.

Looking further, the land use systems involved are grassland, natural land, and wetlands. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. The VC is present in Montenegro because farmers in both bordering regions use pastures there. There's also a strong tradition and cultural heritage connected to the cross-border region with Serbia and Albania.

Now, I'm trying to see if sheep are involved in producing cheese. The narrative mentions beef meat production as the main activity, with cattle farms. It doesn't specifically talk about sheep at all. While it does mention livestock husbandry, which could include various animals, the focus is clearly on beef. There's no mention of dairy products or cheese production.

Since the value chain is centered around beef and there's no indication that sheep are used for cheese, I don't think this VC involves using sheep to produce cheese.

Mushroom cultivation is carried out by modern mushroom companies with fully automated climate systems. In addition to this, the climate in the region is suitable for high quality mushroom production and enables mushroom farming without climate control. Therefore, there are many small-scale farmers in the region. Also, substrate needed for cultivation is easily available, and tourism in the region increases mushroom demand.   Social: Cultivated mushroom production has been started with a few enterprises at the beginning of 1980s in the region. Both mushroom production and number of enterprises have been extended by community interactions.    Shelf life of fresh mushrooms are very short. Cooling for transportation is needed but the possibility of cooling transportation for small farms in the area is limited.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 07 SCA. It talks about barley being suitable for mountain areas like Roros because it grows quickly and doesn't require fertilizers or pesticides. There are four challenges listed related to barley's production and market issues.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with an exogenous type of innovation linked to the Rorosmat brand. The innovation involves new marketing strategies through their e-commerce platform and website. Land use systems mentioned are Cropland, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to check if sheep or cheese production is part of this narrative. Scanning through the text, there's no mention of sheep at all. The focus seems to be entirely on barley production—challenges, growth conditions, marketing strategies. There's nothing about dairy products, cheese-making, or any livestock involved in the process.

Since the narrative doesn't reference sheep or cheese production, I can conclude that this value chain isn't involved in using sheep for cheese. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2776 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France CCVD and the card ID is VC 01 FR1. It talks about conventional agriculture in irrigated field crops in Drôme down valley, with main productions including wheat, corn, garlic, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, aromatic plants, and others. These are mainly directed towards animal food or long chain distribution.

It also mentions new products like lentils and new processes such as dedicated irrigation for high-value crops, crop rotation, organic matter inputs, green fertilizers, reservoirs, and cooperation between various stakeholders. The social assets include local employment, production of local value, meeting territorial food demands, and community interactions around water use.

The challenges faced are water scarcity, drought, parasitism, and the need for adaptation strategies like diversification, rationalizing irrigation, and crop rotation. The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is on field crops, not livestock or dairy products. So, it doesn't seem like this value chain involves using sheep to make cheese.

The mountain value chain described does not involve the use of sheep for producing cheese.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me start by reading through the narrative carefully.

The narrative ID is 2972. It talks about a Value Chain (VC) where the moving reference member state is Scotland Hutton, and the reference card ID is VC13 UK. The main focus here seems to be on forestry—how it's managed for commercial or recreational use, and there's a growing interest in artisanal or bespoke wood products locally.

It mentions natural assets reliant on timber from upland mountain areas, with a steady climate and maintained land use. Social assets include good relations among various stakeholders like timber producers, land managers, carpenters, and tourism businesses. Cultural assets involve traditional knowledge about handcrafted timber methods and local tree heritage.

The challenges include reduced wood availability due to government policies aiming for more forestry coverage by 2032, as well as decreased tourism because of Brexit and COVID. The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation, though it's a niche market. Land use systems are forestry-based, and the local assets cover natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about timber, woodworking, and related industries. There's no indication that the value chain involves livestock or dairy products. Therefore, it doesn't seem like they're using sheep to make cheese.

At the same time, the use of pesticides has increased in areas where there exist intensive agricultural holdings. Another challenge for Pefkothymaromelo is the adulteration with inferior types of honey, some of them imported in extremely low prices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although a product of traditional apicature, pefkothymaromelo has introduced a new type of honey, branded and protected by the PDO characterization.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Greece and the reference card ID is VC 11 GR. It talks about local beekeepers producing pefkothymaromelo, which I think is a type of honey. The families are involved in this traditional apiculture method. So far, nothing about sheep or cheese.

Next, it discusses how severe weather conditions have affected bees and honey production. Pesticides use is also mentioned as a problem. Then there's talk about adulteration with cheaper honey. Challenges faced are both current and predicted, so they're dealing with ongoing issues.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation. They've introduced new products based on honey, like branded and PDO-protected pefkothymaromelo. There are small processing units making various honey-based products in the Kissamos area. Innovations include new products, marketing strategies, and governance systems.

Land use is forestry and natural land, with local assets being natural, social, and cultural. It also mentions that few Greek honeys are registered in the EU catalog, but pefkothymaromelo is the only Cretan honey there.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on honey products. So, the mountain value chain here isn't involved with using sheep for cheese.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Bulgaria, with a specific card ID VC 13 BG. It describes a gorge near Sofia and talks about tourism activities like hiking and photography. There's mention of the Skar River and the geological features of the area, such as rugged crags and high walls.

Next, I'll look for any clues related to sheep or cheese production. The narrative discusses challenges with visitor management, congestion at viewing points, and issues typical of popular tourist spots. It also classifies the VC as Traditional and mentions land use systems like Grassland, Forestry, and Natural land, along with local assets including Natural.

Nowhere in this text is there any mention of sheep or dairy products. The focus seems to be on tourism rather than agriculture or food production. Therefore, it's clear that this mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for cheese production.

Since the narrative doesn't relate to sheep or cheese, I should return an empty JSON as specified.

cosystem with an important presence of associated natural vegetation.    Emphasis should be placed on: greater interest by producers in innovative systems; greater coordination among producers; the development of processing chains and specific products under organic certification; reference to local varieties of olives and mountain cultivars; the opening of specific marketing channels; synergies with other sectors such as culture, the environment and tourism; adaptation to climate change; technical improvements and capacitation in regenerative agriculture. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The value chain has open space for innovation but today it behaves basically as a traditional chain except for the compliance of a small group of producers with the regulations associated with the organic production system. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Similar characteristics occur in many other mountain ranges in Southern Europe where olive oil is produced. However, with some exceptions, a specific value chain has not been articulated that would gain in scale while connecting organic production with innovative and integrated regenerative practices with the conservation of mountain ecosystems and landscapes.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 3052 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA, with a specific card ID VC13 ES. It talks about organic production of olive oil in mountain areas. The key points here are about olive oil production, not cheese or sheep.

It goes on to discuss various aspects like innovative systems, coordination among producers, processing chains for specific products under organic certification, local olive varieties, marketing channels, and synergies with sectors like culture and tourism. There's also mention of adaptation to climate change and technical improvements in regenerative agriculture.

Throughout the narrative, the focus is consistently on olive oil production. There's no mention of sheep or any dairy products, let alone cheese. The challenges and innovations discussed revolve around organic systems for olive oil, not livestock farming or cheesemaking processes.

The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with exogenous innovation related to new processes. However, the land use system mentioned is cropland, which aligns with olive oil production rather than grazing areas where sheep might be involved.

Additionally, similar characteristics are noted in other Southern European mountain ranges for olive oil production, reinforcing that this value chain is centered around olive oil, not cheese from sheep.

Since there's no indication of sheep or dairy products in the narrative, I can conclude that the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Portugal Estrelda and the reference card ID is VC 07 PT2. It talks about rye being cultivated in the mountain area, harvested, and then transformed into flour using water mills still in operation. There's a mention of protected areas but no specific details there.

Next, it goes into employment sector shares for both province and region, which doesn't seem relevant to sheep or cheese production. Then it discusses how rye is traditionally used to make bread because it's resistant to the mountain conditions with poor soil and cold winters. It also mentions that rye is a cereal grain used for flour and bread, growing well in tough environments.

The narrative then poses questions about land abandonment affecting local rye production and whether the value chain can be sustained or if they'll rely more on imported cereals. It classifies this VC as Traditional with unspecified innovation, involving cropland but no mention of livestock or dairy products.

Looking through all this information, there's no reference to sheep at all. The focus is entirely on rye cultivation and its transformation into flour and bread. There's nothing about cheese production, milk, or any animal-based products. So, it seems the value chain here isn't involved with sheep for cheese; it's centered around cereal crops.

Therefore, since there's no indication of sheep being used in this process, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference card ID is VC 06 UK. It then talks about fly fishing for wild salmon being an important value chain in the Scottish Highlands, specifically noting that fish are caught and released unharmed near Inverness. 

Next, there's a lot of data provided about the area size, altimetry, population statistics, income levels, GVA (Gross Value Added) across different sectors, and tourist accommodations. The primary sector has a small share in both the province and region, with 1.37% and 4.03% respectively. The secondary sector is around 35% and 27%, while the tertiary sector dominates at 63.63% and 68.77%. 

There's also information about bed places in tourist accommodations and agricultural holdings, but nothing specifically mentions sheep or cheese production. The narrative ends by noting that there are protected areas in the region.

So, looking through all this, I don't see any mention of sheep being used for cheese production. The main activity discussed is fly fishing, which relates to tourism and possibly the tertiary sector given its higher share. There's no indication of dairy or agricultural activities involving sheep for cheese. 

Therefore, based solely on the content provided, the mountain value chain in this narrative doesn't seem to involve using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2853 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the Di Nucci family organized Value Chains (VCs) involving local economic actors like breeders in high-quality traditional dairy productions. It specifically lists land use systems as Cropland and Grassland, and local assets include Natural, social, and cultural aspects. The company has a quality certification for its milk supply chain and has won awards for products and innovation.

Now, the key points here are that they're involved in dairy production and have breeders as part of their network. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention sheep or cheese production. It talks about high-quality traditional dairy but doesn't specify the type of animals used—sheep, cows, goats, etc. Without explicit mention of sheep being used for cheese, I can't assume that's the case.

Therefore, based solely on the given information, there's no direct evidence that the value chain uses sheep to produce cheese.

Soglio managed to build a well-established brand out of this. However, they also import or grow ingredients in very commercial ways. The innovation here relates to new marketing strategies.

The land use systems involved are N/A, and the local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used to produce cheese in this value chain. From the narrative, it's clear that Soglio is focused on cosmetics made from natural alpine raw materials. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese, or sheep being involved in any part of their production process. The discussion revolves around body care products and marketing strategies, not food or dairy.

Therefore, since there's no indication that the value chain involves using sheep for cheese production, I should return an empty JSON.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 GR. The adaptability and ease in farming led to the cultivation of Aloe vera as an alternative plant during economic crisis of 2008-2016. The plant is being processed to produce jui
 landscape. Olives are the primary crop. The cultivation of Aloe Vera has highly influenced production and distribution and brought on technological developments in manufacturing methods. Aloe Vera is a supplementary income for farmers. Moreover, processing facilities focused on the food/cosmetic industries developed quickly in the past 5 years offering employment opportunities and sustaining the population in these areas. Cultivation of Aloe vera has proven to be economically viable and e-commerce and export pathways that are being further established. Challenges include risk of extinction of rare plants of the local flora which are endemic to the Dikti area and Viannos. Another challenge is that only a few leaf-processing units exist in the area which can contribute to a problematic supply chain. Quality checks are costly and hence may not be sufficient in number. Moreover, fluctuating quality of production has been reported leading to risk of reduced harvests. Adulteration of the final products is another conrern and risk. In Viannos, Aloe Vera is cultivated in great quantities and that helps the young people to stay in the rural areas of the region. Competition of land use and the implementation of ambivalent investment programms are also pressing concerns in the region. Aloe vera is a very profitable investment, and that is significant for crisis-ravaged farmerns in the region. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditiona

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to return the ID of the narrative in a JSON format; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the moving reference member state is Greece, with the reference card ID VC 09 GR. The narrative talks about cultivating Aloe Vera as an alternative during the economic crisis from 2008-2016. They process it for juice and cosmetic industries, which brings technological developments and employment opportunities.

Looking further, the primary crop is olives, and Aloe Vera serves as a supplementary income. There are challenges mentioned like the risk of extinction of rare plants, few processing units causing supply chain issues, quality control costs, fluctuating production quality, and adulteration risks. It also notes that Aloe Vera cultivation helps young people stay in rural areas but faces competition for land use.

Now, I need to check if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or dairy products. It's focused on Aloe Vera cultivation and processing, primarily for juice and cosmetics, not cheese production. There's no reference to livestock farming or dairy industries.

Since there's no indication that the value chain uses sheep for cheese, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2898 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative starts by talking about a Value Chain (VC) with reference member state NMK and reference card ID VC 01 NMK. It mentions that there's no consolidated VC for this product, which might mean it's not widely recognized or organized yet. The mountain chain is Mountain Meleshevija, but the mountain landscape isn't specified.

Next, it says that production is in a very clean environment, like Maleshevija, and these products have rare values. It specifically mentions the production of Juniper essential oil, noting that its variability depends on climate change. There are issues with chemicals being used sometimes wrongly or unnecessarily. Again, it's stated that there isn't a consolidated VC for this product.

The challenges faced by this VC are both current and predicted, and it's classified as Traditional. The type of innovation is unspecified, but Juniper essential oil is used in various innovative products related to the whole VC. Land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land, with local assets including Social and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are involved in producing cheese here. The narrative doesn't mention anything about sheep or dairy production. It's focused on Juniper essential oil, which is a plant-based product, not related to livestock or cheese-making. There's no indication of any connection to sheep or cheese in the content provided.

Therefore, since there's no information suggesting that sheep are used for producing cheese in this value chain, I should return an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2963 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with a reference member state of Scotland Hutton and a Card ID VC 02 UK. It mentions traditional Welsh artisinal Caerphilly cheese, which has European Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. The PGI is noted for English and Welsh spellings, so it's about the specific region where the cheese is made.

It says that Caerphilly cheese is produced within the town and surrounding area of Caerphilly. There's an innovation aspect related to new processes and marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are grassland, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural elements. Additionally, it mentions that Caerphilly cheese is also made in Somerset and Wiltshire in England.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are used in this process. From what I know, cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or sheep. However, the specific mention here is of Caerphilly cheese. I recall that traditional Caerphilly cheese is usually made from cow's milk. It's a type of cheese that originated in Wales and is semi-hard, with a mild flavor.

The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether sheep are involved. It only mentions the production areas and the PGI status. There's no indication of using sheep for milk or any other part of the process. The innovations mentioned relate to processes and marketing, not necessarily the source of the milk.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the narrative, there's no evidence that sheep are used in producing the cheese. It seems focused on traditional methods with cow's milk and regional production.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve using sheep to produce cheese; it pertains to Caerphilly cheese made from cow's milk.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2924 is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the content carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrelda, with a specific card ID. It talks about sheep breeds: Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira. These sheep feed on pastures in the geographical production area of Serra da Estrela.

Next, it describes the characteristics of these sheep—some are white or black, have horns, and females have well-developed udders. It also mentions that they have dairy aptitude, which suggests they're bred for milk production.

Then, there's a point about traditional knowledge being passed down regarding cheese manufacturing techniques using sheep's milk. That directly ties the value chain to cheese production from sheep.

The narrative also discusses challenges like reduced numbers of shepherds due to physical demands and harsh conditions, but that doesn't affect whether they're producing cheese from sheep.

Looking further, it mentions the geographical area where the cheese is produced, listing several municipalities. The type of challenge is current and predicted, and the value chain is classified as traditional with unspecified innovation. Land use systems are grassland, and local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Putting this all together, the narrative explicitly states that sheep are used for their milk in cheese production. Therefore, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

 employment/year [Region] is 54.00%.   An innovative adaptation of game production during the Corona pandemic crisis. The aim is to sell more Slovak game meat to domestic consumers instead of a meat export to other countries. First, a web application was created for an e-commerce to connect verified hunters or sellers directly with consumers. The consumers can visit the webpage and check meat availability, choose meat type, locality and order the products online. Second, the Slovak governement implemented a project entitled 'Delicatess from the forest' with aim to promote game meat from the Slovak forests available on a domestic market and support collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Hunting is an important activity in Slovak mountain areas. The VC is a good example of market adaptation to the restrictions during a pandemic situation.   Natural assets are forests with wild game. Social asset is a collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Cultural asset is a tradition of hunting in Slovak mountains.    1) Pandemic situation causes problems to game supplies. Retail chains require relatively large quantities of the same type of meat in a short time.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3039 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) where the main activities are hunting, selling, meat processing, and accommodation for hunters. The key actors involved are hunters, consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. It mentions that the VC is based in Slovakia and focuses on game production, specifically wild game from forests. They created a web application for e-commerce to connect hunters with consumers directly.

Looking at the activities listed—hunting, selling, meat processing—it seems they're dealing with game meats like deer or boar, which are common in forested areas. There's no mention of sheep or dairy products anywhere in the narrative. The challenges mentioned relate to supplying enough game meat and logistics issues during the pandemic, not anything related to cheese production.

Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows, goats, or sheep. Since the focus here is on hunting and selling wild game meat, it's unlikely that sheep are involved in making cheese. Instead, they're focusing on processing and selling meat directly.

Therefore, based on the information given, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

The narrative does not mention sheep or cheese production; it focuses on hunting and game meat processing.

Wait, the narrative seems cut off at "It is traditionally used for r..." Maybe it was interrupted or there's a typo. But from what I can gather, the value chain involves 'Valser Naturstein,' which is a type of quartzite used in construction or similar industries due to its durability and frost resistance.

The narrative mentions that the VC is classified as Traditional, with land use systems involving Quarries. The local assets include Natural and cultural aspects. There's no mention of sheep, cheese production, agriculture, or any food-related activities. It seems focused on stone or quarrying.

So, considering all this, there's no indication that sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain. The narrative doesn't touch upon dairy products, livestock farming, or any related industries. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep for cheese production.

It focuses on bees and beekeeping as the main elements of the value chain. There's no reference to dairy products, cheese, or any livestock beyond bees.

Additionally, the economic sectors discussed—primary, secondary, tertiary—are centered around agriculture (specifically beeswax and honey) and their subsequent processing into various products. The innovative aspects mentioned are about repurposing beeswax rather than introducing new animal-based products like cheese.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Romania and the VC ID is VC 14 RO. It then talks about 'Pastrama de Oaie,' which is produced from boneless mutton, preserved and smoked with a special recipe. It's sold directly to consumers by sheepfarmers, including tourists.

Wait, so Pastrama de Oaie is made from sheepmeat, not cheese. Cheese typically comes from milk, but this product is specifically from mutton. So it's a meat product, not dairy. 

The rest of the narrative goes into details about the mountain landscape and economic data, but none of that mentions cheese production or anything related to dairy products. It's all about the meat product and its distribution.

Therefore, since the value chain here is producing a meat product from sheep rather than using their milk for cheese, it doesn't involve sheep in cheese production.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID is 3118, which is noted twice, so that's clear. The narrative mentions Switzerland as the reference member state and a specific whiskey brand distilled at a high altitude in Grisons. It also notes that the mountain chain and landscape are unspecified but refers to exogenous ideas bringing whiskey making to Switzerland using Swiss features for marketing.

Looking for clues about sheep or cheese production, I don't see any mention of either. The narrative talks about whiskey, which is a distillate, not dairy products. There's no indication of livestock involvement, let alone sheep, or any cheesemaking processes. The land use system mentioned is cropland, which doesn't directly relate to grazing or dairy.

The local assets include natural and cultural aspects, but again, nothing about agriculture or animal husbandry tied to cheese production. The innovation here seems focused on the whiskey brand rather than dairy products.

So, after reviewing all the details, there's no evidence that sheep are used in this value chain for producing cheese. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

There are mineral water brands that are produced in other mountain areas across the UK (for example Highland Spring also bottle Hydr8 from Blaen Twyni Breacon Beacon National Park), and most focus on the purity associated with being located in mountains. As stated above, the Highland Group has evolved its production by moving plastic and glass bottling production onsite to reduce travel miles; and contributes to wider UK/industry initiatives on recycling bottles/plastics. Water ratio 1:3 described as industry leading. There has been an increase in the production/marketing of Scottish mineral water over the past decade but these cover wider than the Perthshire LAU1 areas so not sure where to put this wider point. For example, there is now a company that sells Scottish Spring Water for Whisky connecting two value chains (but the sources are not in Perthshire).   This suggests that the VC is based on local assets - so Perthshire Mineral Water is dependent on the groundwater filtered through upland land cover (heather and grass); value is added by the processing done in the glens (valleys) of the EMA (just outside the Highland and Island region) using expertise built over time (plan

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it involves using sheep to produce cheese. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. It starts by mentioning Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and refers to VC 01 UK. The main products discussed are Highland Spring and Tesco Perthsire mineral waters. These are described as being extracted from protected catchment sources in the Ochil Hill region.

The narrative goes on to talk about bottled water production since 1979, with a significant volume of 400 million liters per annum. It mentions the ban on farming on the source ground, which is organic and has sustainability awards. There's also mention of other mineral water brands from different mountain areas in the UK, like Hydr8 from Blaen Twyni Breacon Beacon National Park.

Further details include efforts to reduce plastic use by moving bottling onsite, contributions to recycling initiatives, and a water-to-bottle ratio of 1:3. The narrative also notes an increase in Scottish mineral water production over the past decade but points out that these sources aren't limited to Perthshire. There's a mention of a company selling Scottish Spring Water for Whisky, connecting two value chains, though the sources aren't in Perthshire.

Now, I need to determine if sheep are involved in producing cheese within this value chain. The narrative focuses on mineral water production, specifically Highland Spring and Tesco Perthsire brands. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese, or sheep anywhere in the text. All the discussion revolves around water extraction, bottling processes, sustainability practices, and related initiatives.

Since there's no indication that sheep are used for cheese production, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in such activities. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain mentioned in narrative 2927 involves using sheep to produce cheese. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content.

The narrative talks about a Value Chain (VC) with the reference member state being PORTUGAL ESTRELA and the Card ID VC 06 PT2. It mentions smoked sausages as a product, listing ingredients like pig meat, fat, blood, bread, onions, wine, and spices. The smoking process uses oak and chestnut wood.

Looking at the economic sectors, it provides percentages for primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in both the province and region. However, these don't directly relate to sheep or cheese production.

Next, the narrative discusses products connected to territorial identity, specifically smoked sausages. It notes that these are traditionally homemade, made by families during pig slaughter, but have since become industrialized. Traditional knowledge about their manufacture is preserved, and the VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation.

The local assets include cultural aspects, and various types of smoked sausages are produced using different meats and seasonings across Portugal.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on smoked sausages made from pork products. Therefore, the mountain value chain described here isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in using sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state of this VC is NMK, with a specific card ID. It then lists key actors dealing with tourism: Hotel Manastir, Vila Marija, Vila Lina, Aurora hotel, and many families offering private accommodation. So far, nothing about sheep or cheese.

Next, it says the value chain is endogenous, meaning it's self-contained within the region. High technology and intensive communication have made the world more unique and Maleshevija more accessible. Private accommodations are increasing, with many families linked to this VC. Innovation relates to new processes and marketing strategies. 

The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry, and Natural land. Local assets include Natural, social, and cultural aspects. The value chain links catering (products from the region) and diverse selling points through available tourist capacities.

Nowhere in this narrative is there a mention of sheep or cheese production. It's focused on tourism, private accommodations, and local products but doesn't specify what those products are. Since the question is about using sheep for cheese, and that's not mentioned, I should conclude it's not involved.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Italy with UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 07 IT. Then it talks about MP Sardinia's core business being potato production, specifically early potatoes sold on the market before other varieties. They also produce 'cioccoderra' cookies during Christmas and Easter using two types of potatoes: purple and yellow.

The cookies are made with a chocolate praline shell filled with potato cream. The innovation here is using potatoes for pastry making, combining them with cocoa, butter, sugar without preservatives. There's no mention of sheep or cheese anywhere in the narrative. It focuses on potatoes and their use in creating these cookies.

So, since the value chain is centered around potato production and its derivative products like the 'cioccoderra' cookies, there's no indication that they involve sheep for cheese production. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to make cheese.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3120 uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that Fruttipertutti is a project by some farmers in Puschlav. It talks about signs where people can pick fruits and learn their names, which sounds like a community or tourism initiative. The innovative marketing strategy involves giving the product for free but using it as good advertising for the area. That's interesting because it suggests they're focusing on promotion rather than direct sales.

The project is described as technically free, meaning maybe the actual product isn't sold but used to attract visitors or promote something else. They mention that production costs need to be covered somehow, so there must be another revenue stream. The challenges are current and classified as innovative with an endogenous type of innovation, focusing on new marketing strategies.

Looking at the land use systems involved, it's diverse wherever there are fruit trees. Local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects. Nowhere in this description do I see any mention of sheep or dairy production. The focus is more on fruits and marketing rather than livestock or cheese-making.

So, based on the information given, the value chain doesn't involve using sheep to produce cheese. It's centered around fruit picking and innovative marketing strategies related to that.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is 08 AT. It talks about the Murauer brewery being engaged in sustainability and promoting regionality. They have something called Murelli, which seems to be a product line—probably a type of beer since Murauer is known for brewing.

The narrative mentions that Murelli was initially only available on tap but now comes in bottles. The price is low, comparable to Coca-Cola or supermarket lemonades. It also highlights that Murauer is an old beer brand using traditional brewing methods for marketing. They source ingredients regionally and value fresh water as an asset for quality.

The challenges they face include competition from other breweries, especially since they're independent and not part of a larger union like Heineken's. Another challenge is maintaining water quality for sustainability. The VC is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types. Their sustainability efforts and regional sourcing are noted as innovative.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any mention of sheep or cheese production. It's all about a brewery producing beer, focusing on sustainability, regional sourcing, and water quality. There's no indication that they're involved in dairy products like cheese, which would typically involve sheep or other animals for milk.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese. They're a brewery focused on beer, not dairy.

The narrative talks about Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and mentions Ben Lomond as the most southerly Munro. It discusses challenges like footfall, wildlife disturbance, and drones. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. Projects mentioned focus on mental health through green exercise and repairing damage from visitor access. There's also mention of online communities for sharing information about routes, tips, photography, etc.

The land use systems involved are forestry and natural land, with local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects. Other accessible Munros are listed, along with stakeholders like mountaineering clubs, local communities, and online guides. It also mentions Mount Snowdon in Wales as a popular attraction facing similar environmental challenges.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus seems to be on tourism, environmental management, community engagement, and the challenges associated with these aspects. There's no indication that the value chain involves agriculture or dairy products.

Therefore, since the content doesn't reference sheep being used for cheese production, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 48 ES. Traditional charcoal making is the craft of making charcoal from firewood. This has been an essential source of heat, used for cooking or heating houses. The charcoal make
and, maintaining in this context the interest of charcoal makers in a complementary and economically unprofitable activity is another critical challenge, together with the need to carry out a regenerative practice of the forest and not an extractive one. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although it provides innovative nuances by linking an associative structure that brings together the charcoal producers in collaboration with the institution responsible for the Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve, this is a traditional value chain. On the other hand, Carbón de La Cumbre intends to obtain the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certificate for good practices and sustainable forest use, as the vast majority of forest areas in Gran Canaria are already recognized. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There has been an extraordinary activity of charcoal production from vegetal remains from the forest or derived from tree pruning in many other European regions. This is also the case of the traditional charcoal and picón production in Andalusia or the charcoal-making traditions in the Basque Country and Navarre.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described here uses sheep to produce cheese. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA, with a specific card ID. It talks about traditional charcoal making as an essential source of heat for cooking and heating. The challenges include maintaining interest in this activity because it's not economically profitable and the need for regenerative forest practices instead of extractive ones.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation. They're working on getting an FSC certificate for sustainable forestry. The innovations are related to new processes and governance systems. Land use is forestry, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Further down, it mentions the extraordinary activity of charcoal production from forest vegetation or tree pruning in many European regions, including Andalusia, Basque Country, and Navarre. It specifically talks about traditional charcoal and picón production in Andalusia.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of sheep or cheese production. The focus is entirely on charcoal making, its challenges, innovations, and related activities. There's no indication that the value chain involves dairy products or livestock farming for cheese.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain isn't involved in using sheep to produce cheese.
