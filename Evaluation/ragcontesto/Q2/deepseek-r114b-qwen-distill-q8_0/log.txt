Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2881 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the farm has 35 cows from specific breeds: Grigio Alpina and Original Brouw. These are definitely cow breeds, so that tells me they're using cow's milk for their products.

Next, it talks about the main product being 'Formai de Ceresegn' cheese. The description goes on to mention that cheese is a concentrate of high-quality proteins, phosphorus, calcium, and vitamins A and B2. It also notes that cheese produced in mountains has a superior nutritional profile because the animals are fed with natural herbs rich in bioactive compounds.

The narrative doesn't mention anything about goats or goat milk. All references to dairy products point towards cows. The key assets include grasslands and meadows, which aligns with cow grazing areas rather than goat herding regions.

Additionally, it's classified as a traditional value chain, which often relies on local resources and typical livestock in the area. Since Italy is known for its cheese production using cow milk, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, this further supports that cow milk is the primary source here.

There's no indication of any goat milk involvement or mixed milks. The focus seems entirely on cows and their dairy products. Therefore, I can confidently say that this mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Turkey, and the feeding and milking activities involve sheep and goats on small family farms. It also states that some breeders make cheese using dried goat or sheep skin. Additionally, it notes that cheese made from goat and sheep milk is included in other MRLs in countries like Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, and specifically mentions Izmir tulum cheese as a type made by placing into handmade dried goat or sheep skin.

From this, I can gather that the value chain involves goats and sheep for milk production. The narrative explicitly talks about cheese being made from goat and sheep milk, not cow milk. There's no mention of cow milk at all in the context of cheese production here.

So, since the cheese is made using goat or sheep milk, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in producing such cheeses. Therefore, I should output a JSON with the provided ID.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Pirot white cheese in brine can be made from sheep, cow, and mixed milk. It also notes that sheep and mixed cheeses have higher reputation but there's a problem with finding professional shepherds, leading to a lack of sheep milk. Because of this, more cow cheese is produced.

So, the key points here are:
1. The cheese can be made from sheep, cow, or mixed milk.
2. Currently, due to challenges with sheep herders, they're producing more cow cheese.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2788. The narrative mentions that Brocciu is a whey cheese made from ewes and goats' milk. It also talks about processing after making cheese and mentions PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) for Corsican dairies.

Wait, so Brocciu is specifically from ewe's milk or goat's milk? The text says "ewes and goats milk," which could imply that it's made from a mix, but more likely, it's either one or the other. I should check if cow milk is involved at all.

Looking through the narrative again, there's no mention of cow milk anywhere. It discusses ewe's and goat's milk, so unless they're using a mix, which isn't specified, cow milk isn't part of this value chain. The focus seems to be on traditional methods with specific local breeds and processing techniques.

So, since the cheese in question is made from either ewe or goat milk, but not cow milk, and there's no indication that cow milk is used here, I shouldn't include this narrative in the JSON output. Therefore, the correct response would be an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2848 produces cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative says that there are three different cheese producers in Nivegy-valley micro-region. They produce high-quality artisan cheese and milk products. It mentions they keep animals, specifically goats and cows. So, they have both types of livestock. 

Since they're producing cheese and they have both goat and cow animals, it's likely that they use the milk from these animals to make their cheeses. The narrative doesn't specify whether they produce separate cheeses from each type or a mix, but since they keep both, it's reasonable to assume they might be using either one or the other, or perhaps blending them.

Additionally, the value chain is involved in cheese-making and has innovative aspects like packaging and sales channels. This suggests that their cheese production is a significant part of their business model.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain is indeed involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

As the cheese production relies exclusively on milk from the Almenland, challenges in milk production also affect this initiative. Predicted changes in climate (extreme weather conditions: drought, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The key points are:

- The value chain is based in Austria.
- It involves a small local dairy called Almenland.
- They produce various types of cheese using milk from cows, sheep, and goats.
- The milk comes from pasture farming and hay.
- There's mention of challenges related to climate affecting feed production and pasture areas.

Looking for the specific keywords: "cow," "goat," "milk." The narrative explicitly states that they produce cheese from cow, sheep, and goat milk. Since both cow and goat milk are mentioned, this meets the criteria.

I need to ensure I'm only using the provided content as context. There's no external knowledge involved here. The ID is 2725, so the JSON should include that.

The Caciocavallo cheese is produced in a very remote mountain area with a market trait of rurality which is affected by ageing population and depopulation. The remoteness of the area make it difficult for the active part of the population to share formal and informal knowledges and experiences that can promote the valorisation of local natural (busheses, woods, and natural grass land) and human (traditional know-how) resources .

Now, looking for cheese information: The narrative specifically mentions "Vacherin cheese." I know that Vacherin is a type of cheese traditionally made from cow's milk. It's a soft, pungent cheese, often used in dishes like fondue or as a table cheese. However, the narrative also notes that Vacherin is produced in France but under a different PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and recipe.

So, putting this together: The VC in question produces Vacherin cheese, which is made from cow's milk. Therefore, it does involve producing cheese with cow milk. There's no mention of goat milk or a mix, so I don't need to consider those aspects here.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2906 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Maleshevija and Berovo are key regions for cheese production. It lists several brands involved in cheese: Maleshevo milk Berovo, Mlekara Malesh, Mlekara Natasha, and Farma Pacarski. 

The text highlights sheep breeding as a traditional activity in the region, specifically noting that sheep numbers are decreasing. It also mentions that Berovo cheese is recognized for its quality and is sold across the country and beyond. The challenges include the decline in sheep population, difficulty finding shepherds, and market issues like grey markets.

Now, I need to focus on whether the cheese production involves cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative explicitly talks about sheep breeding but doesn't mention cows or goats. It refers to "sheep number is rapidly decreasing," which suggests that sheep's milk might be the primary source for their cheese. 

Cheese types can vary widely depending on the milk used. Common cheeses include cow's milk (like Cheddar), goat's milk (like Feta), and mixed. However, in this case, since the narrative emphasizes sheep breeding and doesn't mention cows or goats, it's likely that the cheese is made from sheep's milk.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of other milks. The brands listed don't provide specific clues about their milk sources beyond what's stated. There's no indication that they use cow or goat milk; instead, the focus is on sheep and the challenges related to sheep farming.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 2906 doesn't seem involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The primary source appears to be sheep's milk.

If so, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions "Parmigiano Reggiano DOP," which is described as a hard cheese made from raw cow's milk. It specifies that it's handcrafted without additives or preservatives. Additionally, there are details about the production area being in mountain regions and the requirements for certification, such as 100% milk from mountain stables and over 60% of cows' feed grown locally.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3143 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the VC (Value Chain) includes farmers and potentially resellers in local markets because raw milk can't be stored long and is mainly sold directly. It talks about challenges like increasing droughts affecting fodder and spruce trees, which impact grazing areas. The type of challenge is both current and predicted, and the VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.

The innovation here is endogenous, meaning it comes from within the system. They're using raw milk, which is a return to traditional forms, making it stand out from industrial milk. The marketing strategies are new, but the land use is grassland, and local assets include natural elements.

Now, looking for mentions of cheese production: I don't see any specific information about cheese being produced in this VC. It does talk about raw milk sales, especially in mountain regions near grazing areas. But there's no indication whether this raw milk is used to make cheese or if the VC itself produces cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

Since the narrative doesn't explicitly state that cheese is made using cow, goat, or a mix of both milks, I can't confirm involvement in such cheese production. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative produces cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2 and has a protected designation of origin (PDO). It says there are 237 dairy farms, 9 cheese dairies, and 2 ripeners. The milk comes from cattle on extensive grazing systems, often in wooden pastures. Cheese production uses traditional knowledge dating back to the 17th century.

Nowhere does it mention goat milk or a mix of cow and goat milk. It specifically talks about milk from cattle, which are cows. So, the cheese is made with cow milk. Therefore, the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3157 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully to identify any mentions of cheese production and the types of milk used. The narrative starts by mentioning that Turkey is the reference member state, with a specific card ID. It then talks about cheese production in Erzincan, where there are nearly half a million sheep. 

The key part here is: "Cheese is produced from the milk of the White Karaman sheep which graze..." So, it's clear that the cheese comes from sheep's milk specifically. There's no mention of cows or goats in this context.

I'll continue reading to see if there are any other clues. It mentions Erzincan Tulum Cheese having a geographical indication and being produced using traditional methods by small-scale farms. The challenges include a lack of infrastructure, but again, the focus is on sheep milk.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cows or goats at all in relation to cheese production, it's safe to conclude that this value chain isn't involved with cow, goat, or mixed milk cheeses. Therefore, I shouldn't output any JSON with an ID; instead, I'll provide an empty JSON as specified.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm given a narrative about a mountain value chain, and I need to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I have to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3130. Let me go through each part:

- It mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland 2.
- The reference card ID is VC 06 CH2.
- The value chain includes a family farm that produces, processes, and sells yogurt directly on the farm.
- They also sell products to local cheese dairies. The product is labeled 'IP S', but I'm not sure what that stands for exactly.
- There are challenges mentioned related to climate change affecting milk production. Specifically, droughts threaten fodder, causing loss of pasture and spruce trees in wooded areas. This affects the landscape and shade.
- Uncertainties about the impact on grassland production and animal health: reduced grass growth in summer but a longer growing season by one month depending on scenarios.
- The type of challenge is both current and predicted.
- The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, though the innovation specifics aren't detailed beyond new products.
- Land use systems involved are Grassland.
- Local assets include Natural and cultural aspects.

Now, focusing on whether they produce cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative says the family farm produces yogurt using goat's milk. It also sells to local cheese dairies. So, the farm itself is producing yogurt with goat's milk. Additionally, since they sell products to cheese dairies, it's possible that these dairies might be making cheese from the same source of milk—goat's milk.

However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese production on the farm or by the value chain. It only mentions yogurt and selling to cheese dairies. So, while the dairy products are involved, the specific mention is about yogurt, not cheese. Therefore, unless it's inferred that the cheese dairies use goat milk as well, which isn't stated, I can't confirm cheese production.

Wait, but the farm produces yogurt from goat's milk and sells to cheese dairies. It doesn't say if those dairies are part of this value chain or external. If the cheese is made by other dairies, then maybe the value chain itself isn't producing cheese. The narrative focuses on the family farm's activities—producing yogurt and selling products, which might include milk or other dairy products.

But since the question is about whether the mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk, I need to see if any part of this VC produces cheese. The farm makes yogurt but doesn't mention cheese. They sell to cheese dairies, which might be separate entities. So, unless the cheese production is part of this VC, it's not involved in producing cheese.

Therefore, based on the information given, the value chain isn't directly involved in producing cheese made from cow, goat, or a mix. It's more focused on yogurt production and selling to other dairies for cheese, but that doesn't necessarily mean the VC itself is making cheese.
</think>

The narrative describes a family farm producing yogurt with goat milk and selling products to local cheese dairies. However, it does not explicitly state that the value chain itself produces cheese. Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't directly involved in cheese production.

'Telemea' is a salted white cheese most commonly made from sheep or cows' milk, but sometimes also from goats' milk. Varying degrees of ageing. Widepread traditional mountain product in Romania. Similar to Greek 'feta'. This specific value chain is for a 'Telemea' made from cows' milk by a small-scale producer in Vaideeni commune (174021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-telemea-din-lapte-de-vaca/).   The natural asset used for producing 'Telemea' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing).    Value chains for artisanal products such as the 'Telemea' produced in the Vaideeni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality / 'counterfeit' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Romania and the reference card ID is VC 10 RO. It talks about 'Telemea' cheese being made by adding rennet to milk and curdling it. The process involves draining, pressing, and cutting into squares. 

Then it provides some statistics on employment sectors in the region. Not too relevant for this task, but I'll note that the secondary sector (which includes manufacturing) has a 26.80% share.

Next, it describes 'Telemea' as a salted white cheese made from sheep or cows' milk, sometimes goats' milk. So here's my first clue: it mentions cow and goat milk as possible sources. 

The specific value chain discussed is for Telemea made from cows' milk by a small-scale producer in Vaideeni commune. It's registered as a Mountain Product on the provided link. The natural assets used are semi-natural grasslands, which makes sense for grazing.

It also mentions that this cheese is vulnerable because of counterfeit products and external factors like COVID affecting sales. But it's registered to promote the product and build consumer confidence.

So putting it all together: Telemea can be made from cow, sheep, or goat milk. The specific value chain in question uses cows' milk for their production. Therefore, this mountain value chain is indeed involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2874. The narrative mentions that the cheese is produced only with milk from the 'Podolica' cow. That's a local breed, so it's definitely cow milk. There's no mention of goat milk or any mixtures.

I should check if there are any other clues about different types of milk being used. The processing relies on traditional activities, and most production is on-farm with few large processors. They're exploring alternative marketing strategies but nothing about changing the type of milk they use.

The land use systems mentioned are grassland, forestry, and natural land, which supports dairy farming but doesn't indicate goat herding specifically. Also, the local assets include natural and cultural aspects, which again don't point towards goat milk production.

Since the narrative explicitly states that cheese is made from Podolica cow milk and there's no indication of using goat milk or a mix, I can confidently say this value chain is involved in producing cow milk cheese.

So, the appropriate response would be a JSON object with the ID 2874.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Spain UCO and the VC ID is 14 ES. It talks about goats sleeping and grazing on the same farm where cheese production happens. The goats are milked daily, and their milk is sent to a lab. 

Further down, it explicitly says they produce high-quality goat cheese from the Florida Andaluza breed. These goats have grazed in natural pastures for centuries. There's also mention of challenges like the scarcity of herds, competition with industrially-produced cheese, and expanding their market beyond the province.

The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with exogenous innovation related to energy use and waste management. They use solar energy and treat wastewater for reuse in their garden. The land use systems are grassland and animal skin/leather, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Another point of interest is that there's another goat cheese producer nearby, 'Besos y Quesos,' which uses goats of the Malagueña breed. This reinforces that the primary milk source here is goats.

I don't see any mention of cow milk or a mix of both in this narrative. It's all about goat milk for cheese production.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that "Milk Kid" is seasonally produced, mostly for Christmas by about 200 farmers. The association of farmers handles slaughtering and reconnecting activities like milk lamb and dairy production. 

I'm trying to figure out if this involves cheese production. The term "milk" could refer to either drinking milk or the milk used in cheesemaking. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese. It talks about reconnecting food production with uses like cooking and eating habits, but that's more about the broader context rather than specific products.

The value chain is described as traditional, dealing with challenges related to reconnection of activities separated by modernization. The local assets are natural and cultural, which might relate to dairy farming but again, no direct mention of cheese.

I also note that it's compared to meat production in Portugal, which suggests the primary focus here isn't on dairy products like cheese. Without explicit information about cheese being part of this value chain, I can't confirm its involvement in producing such a product.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that this mountain value chain is involved in making cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk. So, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Turkey is the reference member state and the VC 18 TR is the card ID. It talks about small family farms handling feeding and milking for sheep and goats. Cheese ripening is done in dried goat or sheep skin, which sounds unique and traditional.

Looking at the cheese part: it says "Cheese which is made from goat and sheep milk..." So they specifically use goat and sheep milk for their cheese. There's no mention of cow milk being involved. The narrative also notes that Bergama tulum cheese is a special kind made by placing into handmade dried goat or sheep skin, reinforcing that only goat and sheep milk are used.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.91%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.27%.   The dairy, owned by a local cooperative of farmers, collects and processes the milk produced by 24 local farmers to produce Italian and local cheeses. For the production of the traditional Friulian cheese called 'Montasio', the dairy obtained in 2011 the certification 'denomination product of origin (DPO) and 'mountain product' (MP) label. In this case, the VC is strongly linked to the natural (pasture, mountain, cows, etc.) and cultural (cheese production, mountain culture, etc.) elements of the SES. The dairy's products are traditional, and innovations include adopting quality certificates and some 'new products' (but based on the food local tradition). This guarantees a competitive advantage in the market. In the dairy shop, local cheeses and milk are offered, and various other products from local and regional producers. Some of these products use cheeses from dairy (e.g. 'Frico').   The SES is involved in the VC for several reasons.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) involves ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI as reference members. It talks about local SES, breeders, and farmers collaborating in a cooperative to produce milk and cheeses. 

Looking further, it specifically mentions the production of 'Montasio' cheese, which was certified as a Denomination of Origin and a Mountain Product. The dairy uses milk from 24 local farmers and processes it into Italian and local cheeses. It also notes that they use exclusively Italian Red Fleckvieh cattle for grazing on grasslands.

Now, I need to figure out what type of milk is used here. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention goat milk, but it does talk about cows—specifically the Italian Red Fleckvieh breed. Since Montasio cheese is traditionally made from cow's milk, that's a strong indicator. Goat milk isn't mentioned at all, so I can assume they're not using it.

The user asked if the value chain produces cheese with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Based on this, since cow milk is involved and there's no mention of goats or mixed milks, the answer should include the ID.

I should make sure I'm only relying on the provided content and not external knowledge. The example given in the query shows that if it's involved, we output the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON. So, since cow milk is definitely part of this VC, I'll proceed accordingly.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3157 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Turkey, and the value chain (VC) is classified as Traditional. It's also present in several other countries like Czech Republic, France, etc., but the main focus seems to be on Turkey.

The key part here is about cheese production. It says that cheese is produced on the plateaus and pastures of Erzincan, where there are nearly half a million sheep. The cheese comes from the milk of White Karaman sheep. Now, I know that sheep's milk is commonly used in certain types of cheeses, like feta or pecorino. However, the question specifically asks about cow milk, goat milk, or a mix.

So, the narrative doesn't mention cows or goats at all. It only talks about sheep. Therefore, this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow milk, goat milk, or a mixture of both. They're using sheep's milk exclusively.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention that might imply the use of other milks, but I don't see anything like that. The focus is clearly on sheep. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the value chain isn't involved in the specified types of cheese production.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 FR. In Corsica, on-farm cheese making is defended by an association of farmers (of dairy goats and dairy ewes), Casgiu Casanu, which has existed since 1998 and has been locally and nationally active. It defends farmers' interests regarding the evolution of european and national regulations. It provides specific training (hygiene, different processes for transformation of milk) and it has developped an efficient structure for cheeses' transport, in Corsica and in the French Continent. As on-farm cheese making often plays a key role in preserving traditional know-how, it is recognized in a geographical indication (PDO Brocciu) and plays a central role in the on-going labelling project (5 different projets regarding different types of local cheeses: venachese, sartinese, calinzanincu, niolincu, bastelicacciu). Of-farm cheese making is particularly present in mountainous areas where it is one of the remaining (agricultural) activities. It contributes to the villages' vividness. In its traditional form, this type of husbandry contributes to land management near those villages. New forms of husbandry have developed more recently, which are more intensive (use of foreign breeds, indoors husbandry) and less interconnected to the local ecosystem.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain in Corsica and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that there's an association called Casgiu Casanu which represents dairy goats and dairy ewes. It talks about on-farm cheese making and PDO Brocciu, which is a specific type of cheese. 

I know that PDO stands for Protected Designation of Origin, so Brocciu must be a traditional cheese from Corsica. Now, the question is whether this cheese uses cow milk, goat milk, or both.

Looking at the narrative again, it specifically mentions dairy goats and dairy ewes. Ewes are sheep, so they produce sheep's milk. Goats produce goat's milk. There's no mention of cows in this context. So, the cheeses involved here are likely made from either goat or sheep milk, but not cow milk.

Since the user is asking if the value chain produces cheese with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, and since there's no indication of cow milk being used, I shouldn't include it. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 RO. 'Brănză Horezu' was first produced in the town of Horezu in the mountainous region of northern Vâlcea County (RO415) in 2001. All milk used for cheese production is collected d

It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-fermentata-din-lapte-de-oaie-horezu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Brănză Horezu' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing). Many of the communal pastures are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and traditional dairy products. With the increased purchasing power and changing preferences of Romanian consumers there has been an increase in consumption of these dairy products, but also a clear demand for more sophisticated 'gourmet / speciality' cheeses (especially in urban areas and amongst young professionals). In part this demand has been met by imported cheeses, but it has also opened a niche for Romanian speciality cheeses such as 'Brănză Horezu' which is also widely known under the brand name 'Five Continents' (http://www.five-continent-srl.ro/index.html). The challenge now is maintaining this place in the market, especially since many new and interesting Romanian cheeses have entered the market in the last few years - including gourmet mature cheeses, blue cheeses and goat cheeses.

If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that 'Brănză Horezu' is produced using sheep's milk. It specifically states, "All milk used for cheese production is collected / fermented sheep's milk." This clearly indicates that the primary ingredient here is sheep's milk, not cow or goat milk.

I should also check if there's any mention of mixing with other types of milk. The narrative doesn't suggest that they're using a mix; it's solely sheep's milk. Additionally, the challenge mentioned includes competition from other cheeses like goat cheeses, but that doesn't imply their own product uses goat milk—it just means there are similar products in the market.

Since the cheese is made exclusively with sheep's milk, it doesn't fall under cow, goat, or a mix of both. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2825 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that traditionally, female family members are involved in processing milk and preparing wheat to make xinochontros (ksinochondros). It's described as a high-priced product and a traditional one not well known to younger consumers. The quality of milk and local wheat makes it unique, even referred to as a superfood.

Now, the key here is whether this involves cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Cheese typically comes from milk, so I need to see what kind of milk is used for xinochondros. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cows, goats, or any specific type of milk. It just talks about milk in general and local wheat.

I should also consider that sometimes traditional products might use a mix, but without explicit information, I can't assume that. The focus seems to be more on the processing of milk and the combination with wheat rather than specifying the source of the milk.

Therefore, since there's no mention of cow or goat milk specifically, I shouldn't conclude that this value chain is involved in producing cheese from those sources.

The narrative does not specify whether xinochontros (ksinochondros) is made using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. It only mentions the processing of milk and local wheat without detailing the type of milk used.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2782 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France CCVD and the reference card ID is VC 07 FR1. It then talks about Picodon AOP being a goat-milk cheese from the Drome region. That's interesting because it specifically mentions goat milk. 

Further down, it says that Picodon AOP has strict requirements for production practices, including the type of goat, refinements, cultural practices, pasture, and animal feeding. It also mentions that the value chain is structured by farmers unions like Syndicat Caprin and Syndicat AOP Picodon, as well as dairy cooperatives. 

The narrative goes on to discuss marketing channels, both long distribution and local markets, and notes a variety of production practices such as organic and conventional methods. In 2017, the production was 532 tons, with nearly 9 million picodons made. A significant portion, about 1.6 million, were produced by farm producers and sold locally.

It also touches on pastoralism challenges like wolf predation and droughts but mentions opportunities for ecosystemic services like sylvopastoralism and preventing forest fires through goat grazing.

Now, the key point here is that Picodon AOP is explicitly stated to be a goat-milk cheese. There's no mention of cow milk or mixed milk in the narrative. The focus is entirely on goat milk production. 

So, based on this information, the mountain value chain in question is involved in producing cheese made with goat milk. Since the query asks if it's involved in producing cheese from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, and since goat milk is included, I should include the ID in the JSON.

I need to make sure I'm only using the content provided and not adding any external knowledge. The narrative clearly states it's about goat milk cheese, so that's sufficient.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that there are 20 dairies collecting milk from about 300 dairy farmers. It specifies that these farmers are mostly dairy-Ewe (which I believe refers to dairy cows) but also includes dairy-Goat farmers. So, right away, it's clear that both cow and goat milk are involved in the production.

The narrative goes on to say that some of those farmers make their own cheese, specifically mentioning 'cheese two,' which might be a typo or specific term, but regardless, the key point is that cheese is being produced. It also notes that while dairies might not be located in mountainous areas, they collect milk from there, indicating that the value chain does involve milk collection and cheese production.

Additionally, the narrative mentions that dairy husbandry and cheese production are observable in several MRLs (which I assume stands for Monitoring Regions or something similar) across different countries. This further supports the involvement of the value chain in cheese production using both cow and goat milk.

Since all these points clearly indicate that the mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or a mix of both milks, the appropriate response would be to include the narrative's ID in a JSON object.

This farming family relies heavily upon direct sales, but have chosen to diversify their outlets to mitigate against the risk of interruption / disruption.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2952 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that Romania is the reference member state and talks about cheeses like 'Brânză de Burduf' under the brand 'Stâna de Vaideeni'. It says these cheeses are produced in a licensed processing unit. Then it goes on to discuss challenges faced by the farming family, such as competition from lower quality industrial products, reliance on direct sales, and issues with depopulation affecting labor.

Looking for mentions of milk types: The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether the cheese is made from cow, goat, or a mix. It does mention that they have sheep and cattle for grazing but doesn't specify which milk is used for cheese production. 'Brânză de Burduf' might be a specific type of cheese, so I should check if that's typically made with cow or goat milk.

Wait, from what I recall (though I shouldn't use external knowledge), Brânză de Burduf is usually a sheep's milk cheese. But since the user instructed not to use external info, I can't rely on that. So based solely on the narrative provided, there's no explicit mention of the milk type used.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't specify whether cow, goat, or a mix is used for the cheese production, I shouldn't assume. The answer should be an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2857. Let me go through each part of the narrative to see if there's any mention of cheese or milk types.

The narrative talks about a value chain involving ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI as reference members. It mentions that the VC isn't dependent on other SES for production. The key actors are family farmers producing white garlic and herbs in a mountain area. They use the label 'Prodotto di Montagna' to emphasize quality, highlighting the unpolluted mountain air and soil which add aromaticity.

They also focus on packaging that reflects both rural culture and modern style, and they've implemented e-commerce. Comparing to traditional farming, they're adopting marketing strategies aligned with current trends. The VC is described as small, not involving local institutions or other farmers. It's classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation type.

Now, looking for any mention of cheese or milk. The narrative doesn't talk about dairy products at all. It's focused on white garlic and herbs. There's no indication that they produce cheese or use cow or goat milk in their products. All the emphasis is on the quality of the mountain environment affecting the aromaticity of their garlic and herbs.

So, based on this analysis, the value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the user's instructions.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID is 2993, so that's important for the response. The narrative mentions Serbia as the reference member state and talks about several operators, mostly small homemade processing workshops. It discusses the decline in sheep numbers due to depopulation and lifestyle changes from pasture grazing to stationary systems. This has led to milk shortages.

Now, looking at the products mentioned: it refers to a traditional product considered a potent 'super food.' The narrative also mentions that there are new alterations in packaging, meat mixture (goat, sheep, cow, or donkey), and spices. Wait, "meat mixture"? That's interesting because cheese is typically dairy-based, not meat.

So, the key point here is whether the value chain produces cheese. The mention of a meat mixture suggests it might be a different product, like a sausage or some kind of processed meat rather than cheese. Cheese usually involves milk from cows, goats, etc., but if they're talking about a meat mixture, that's a red flag.

Additionally, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that cheese is being produced. It talks about processing facilities and small-scale machinery for pressing, which could relate to cheese production, but combined with the mention of meat mixtures, it's unclear. Without explicit confirmation that cheese is made from milk, I can't assume it's involved in dairy-based cheese.

Therefore, since there's no clear indication that the value chain produces cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk, and instead mentions a meat mixture, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2880 produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions 'Latte del Parco' farm, which is linked to the natural and cultural context of the mountains. It emphasizes authenticity and traditionality but doesn't stress the marketing aspect much. The farm uses pastureland for seven months and distinguishes its production using the natural landscape.

Looking further, the value chain intersects with different sectors like confectionery to enhance milk and the naturalistic context. They produce processed products beyond local dairy traditions, such as ice creams and parfaits from farm milk. However, there's no specific mention of cheese types or the type of milk used for cheese production.

The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether they make cheese from cow, goat, or a mix. It talks about using pastureland but not the specifics of dairy animals or milk sources. Since cheese is mentioned in the context of processed products, but without details on the milk type, I can't confirm if it's involved in producing cheese with the specified milks.

Therefore, based solely on the given content, there's no evidence that the value chain produces cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions Turkey as the reference member state and talks about dairy cattle enterprises being small-scale. It specifically states that cows graze in the highlands and that livestock is the main livelihood for households. 

Looking further, it mentions two types of cheese: Kars Gruyere and Kashar. Both are produced using traditional methods. The narrative also specifies that Zavot cow's milk is used in production. Additionally, there's a note about the importance of pasture-based dairy cows' milk affecting the quality of the cheese.

I don't see any mention of goat milk or a mix of cow and goat milk in the narrative. It explicitly refers to cow milk for both Kars Gruyere and Kashar cheeses. Therefore, the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

Since the criteria are met, I should output the JSON containing the ID of the narrative.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2788 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the Value Chain (VC) ID is VC 02 FR. It talks about Brocciu being a whey cheese from ewes and goats' milk. So, Brocciu is made from ewe's milk and goat's milk. That means it's specifically using goat milk, not cow milk or a mix.

The narrative also mentions that Brocciu is obtained after making cheese, depending on other Value Chains like dairy cheese production and on-farm cheese production. It notes that cheese is observable in every other MRLs and that recognition of GIs (Geographical Indications) is common in those areas.

So, the key point here is that Brocciu uses ewe's and goat's milk. There's no mention of cow milk or a mix with cow milk. Therefore, this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. It specifically uses only goat and ewe milk.

I should make sure I'm not adding any external knowledge here. The narrative clearly states the types of milk used, so based on that alone, the answer is that it's not involved in producing the specified cheeses.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2788 produces Brocciu cheese, which is made from ewe's and goat's milk. There is no mention of cow milk or a mix involving cow milk.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If yes, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2806. The narrative mentions that free-range sheep and goat breeding are predominant activities in the area. It specifically talks about the production of graviera, which is a type of cheese. 

Now, looking at the details: the native flora contributes to aromatic and rich fat milk used for traditional dairy products. A local cheesemaker is reviving cheesemaking as a small industry, focusing on Graviera of Amari. The narrative also mentions that sheep and goats are bred in mountainous areas, utilizing pastures connected with locals' social activities.

I need to determine if the cheese production involves cow milk, goat milk, or both. From the text, it's clear that sheep and goats are the primary animals mentioned. There's no mention of cows at all. Graviera is traditionally made from sheep or goat milk, so this value chain isn't using cow milk.

Since the narrative doesn't include cow milk, goat milk alone doesn't meet the criteria of producing cheese with either cow, goat, or a mix. Wait, actually, goat milk is involved. The user's instruction says if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, then output the ID. Since goat milk is used, I should include the ID.

Wait, but the example given for when it's involved includes only the ID. So yes, since goat milk is part of the production, the JSON should have {"id": "2806"}.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that hay milk is produced by organic farmers who supply to a regional dairy. It talks about processing into various dairy products and mentions challenges related to climate change affecting pasture-based production and hay for winter. 

Now, looking for clues about cheese types: the term "hay milk" stands out. I know that in some regions, especially alpine areas, "hay milk" refers to cow's milk because cows are typically grazed on meadows (hay fields) during certain seasons. Goat milk isn't as commonly associated with this term. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention goats or a mix of milks.

Additionally, the focus is on organic farming and regional dairy products, which often rely on cow milk for cheese production in such contexts. There's no indication that goat milk is involved here. 

So, putting it all together, the value chain does produce cheese from cow milk but not from goat milk or a mix. Therefore, I should include the ID in the JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3132 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions Alpine Gruyère being produced seasonally from April to October in 53 alpine chalets. It's organized by the Gruyère Interprofession created in 1997. Switzerland is known for its dairy products, and Gruyère is a specific type of cheese. The text also talks about the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors' employment shares but doesn't directly mention the milk source.

However, it does say that the production is connected to cattle farming, which is the main farming system in Switzerland. Cattle farming typically refers to cows, so this suggests that cow's milk is used. There's no mention of goat milk or a mix, so I don't think goat milk is involved here.

Additionally, the narrative emphasizes the use of pastures and natural assets for dairy production, which aligns with cow-based dairy rather than goats, who are often kept in different conditions. The cheese has an international reputation, which further supports that it's a well-known cow milk product like Gruyère.

So putting this together, the mountain value chain here is definitely involved in producing cheese made from cow milk.

The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 08 SCA. It then describes Pultost as a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without rennet. So right away, it mentions cow's milk specifically.

I should note that the narrative explicitly states "cow's milk," which means the value chain is involved in producing cheese using cow milk. There's no mention of goat milk or a mix, so I don't need to consider those aspects here.

Next, looking at other parts of the narrative, it talks about the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors' employment shares but doesn't add any information about the type of milk used beyond what's already stated. It also mentions natural pastures and traditional knowledge related to cheese production, which supports the idea that cow milk is the base for their cheese.

Since the narrative clearly specifies that Pultost is made from cow's milk, I can confidently say that the mountain value chain in question is involved in producing cheese with cow milk. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should output a JSON object containing the ID of this narrative.

It is a very specific mountain product associated with the Southern Romanian Carpathians and there are numerous variants according to local tradition. This specific value chain is for a 'Brânză de Burduf' made from sheeps' milk by a farming family based in Vaideeni commune (174021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). The family is part of an agricultural cooperative with 13 members and trades under the brand name of 'Stâna de Vaideeni' ('Vaideeni Sheepfold') - see here: https://www.revista-ferma.ro/articole/afaceri-agricole/oameni-si-branduri-stana-de-vaideeni.

If so, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is Romania, and the value chain (VC) has a specific ID. It talks about cheeses marketed under the 'Stâna de Vaideeni' brand, including 'Brânză de Burduf'. 

Looking further, it states that this cheese is produced in a licensed processing unit. The narrative also mentions that the family produces around 10 different types of cheese from sheep and cows' milk, along with liquid milk and butter. This part is crucial because it explicitly lists the sources of milk used: sheep and cows.

The user's task is to check if the value chain involves cow, goat, or a mix. Since the narrative mentions both sheep and cows' milk, but not goat milk, I need to see if cows' milk alone qualifies. The presence of cows' milk in production means the value chain is indeed involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

Therefore, the JSON should include the ID of this narrative. I'll structure it as {"id": "2952"}.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3143 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the value chain includes farmers and potentially resellers in local markets. It talks about raw milk being sold directly because it can't be stored for long. The focus seems to be on raw milk sales rather than cheese production. They mention other valorisation of milk through direct sales, which gives a better price per litre for farmers.

It also discusses dairy production based on pastures, which are part of the Swiss cultural landscape. Grazing depends on these landscapes, and without cattle, they might revert to forests. However, there's no specific mention of cheese being produced from cow or goat milk. Instead, it emphasizes raw milk and direct sales as a strategy.

The challenges mentioned include conservation issues due to climate change affecting natural resources like fodder and spruce trees, which in turn affects the landscapes used for grazing. But again, this is about the sustainability of milk production, not cheese.

So, while the narrative talks about dairy production and pastures, it doesn't explicitly state that cheese is being made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. It's more focused on raw milk sales and the environmental aspects of grazing. Therefore, I don't have enough information to conclude that the value chain produces cheese using those types of milk.
</think>

The narrative does not mention cheese production specifically but focuses on raw milk sales and dairy practices. There is no indication that cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk is part of this value chain.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Slovakia and the key activities include sheep breeding, cow milk production, cheese production, and marketing. The key actors are shepherds, cheese producers, and marketers. It also mentions labeling as PGI (Protected Geographical Indication).

Looking further, it talks about specific cheeses: Slovenská bryndza, Slovenská parenica smoked or not smoked, and Slovenský oštiepok - smoked or not smoked. These are all registered as protected products in Slovakia with the PGI label.

Importantly, each cheese type must contain at least 50% sheep's milk. The narrative emphasizes that these cheeses have a high identity value related to Slovak mountains and that sheep and cows pasture in these areas, contributing to specific land use and landscape scenery.

Now, I'm trying to see if any of the cheeses mentioned are made with cow or goat milk or a mix. The key point is that all described cheeses must contain at least 50% sheep's milk. There's no mention of using cow or goat milk in these products. Even though cow milk production is listed as a key activity, it doesn't specify that the cheese uses cow milk.

So, based on this, the value chain is focused on sheep's milk cheeses and not on producing cheese with cow or goat milk. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2797. Let me go through each part of the narrative to spot any mentions related to cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France INRAE and the VC reference is VC 11 FR. It talks about "milk lamb" being seasonally produced in autumn by around 300 dairy-ewe farmers. So, ewe refers to female sheep, which means goat milk might be involved since goats are also part of similar livestock.

Next, it mentions two associations handling slaughter and reconnecting activities like milk lamb and dairy production. The challenge is about reconnection due to modernization, focusing on traditional methods. They're trying to link food production with local uses, including cooking and eating habits.

The narrative then discusses a stakeholder organization linked to the biggest dairy that collects milk lambs for slaughter in Sardinia. They freeze parts for later sale during the tourist season. There's an ongoing project for PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) for Corsican milk lamb but it hasn't succeeded yet. The innovation is about new processes, involving land use systems like grassland and agrosylvopastoral areas.

Looking at all this, the key points are "milk lamb" from dairy-ewe farmers. Ewes produce sheep milk, not cow or goat milk. There's no mention of cows or goats in the narrative. The focus is on lamb production for meat and possibly dairy products like cheese from sheep milk, but since the user specifically asks about cow, goat, or a mix, this doesn't apply.

Therefore, the value chain here isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow, goat, or mixed milk. So, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3028 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the key activities are "livestock pasture" and "milk processing." The key actors include farmers and shepherds, milk processors, and traders. It specifically states that cows and sheep from 73 Slovak farms supply milk exclusively for 'Liptov' products. So, they're using both cows and sheep for milk production.

The narrative also talks about the milk being processed at a set altitude of at least 500 meters in areas like Liptov, Orava, Spiš, and Gemer. It mentions that grassland for livestock is part of the cultural landscape identity in Slovakia.

Looking further, there are challenges mentioned related to climate change affecting milk quality and consumer awareness about mountain milk's benefits. The value chain is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation.

So, putting this together: since both cows and sheep (which produce goat milk) are involved in supplying milk for cheese production, the mountain value chain here is indeed producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2788 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the reference card ID is VC 02 FR. It talks about Brocciu being a whey cheese from ewes and goats milk. So, right off the bat, it specifies that Brocciu is made from goats' milk.

Next, I'll look for any mention of cow milk or a mix with cows'. The narrative doesn't mention cows at all. It specifically says "ewes and goats milk," which means the cheese is produced using either goat milk alone or in combination with ewe's milk, but not cow milk.

I should also consider if there's any implication that other types of milk might be involved indirectly. For example, sometimes value chains can have multiple products, but in this case, Brocciu is clearly defined as a cheese from goats and ewes. There's no indication that cow milk is part of the production process here.

Additionally, the narrative describes the mountain landscape as Corsica, where small ruminant farming is prevalent. Since cows aren't typically associated with Corsican dairy products in this context, it further supports that cow milk isn't involved.

So, putting it all together: Brocciu is made from goats and ewes' milk, there's no mention of cow milk, and the region doesn't suggest cow-based cheese production. Therefore, the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in producing cheese with cow milk or a mix.

The narrative describes Brocciu as a whey cheese made from ewes' and goats' milk, without mentioning cow milk.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2807 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the production of Dry Anthotyros affects breeders on the Lasithi plateau and their families. It's described as a traditional cheese factory operating since 1984. The main product is dry anthotyros, which is part of Crete's cultural heritage. 

Now, I'm trying to recall what Dry Anthotyros is made from. From general knowledge, Anthotyros is typically a Greek cheese, and I think it's usually made from goat milk. However, since the user instructed me not to use external knowledge beyond the provided narrative, I should focus solely on the given text.

Looking at the narrative again, it says that Dry Anthotyros is produced by small family firms and big cooperatives in Crete. It doesn't explicitly mention whether it's made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. But since it's traditional and associated with areas where goat herding is common, I might infer goat milk, but the narrative itself doesn't specify.

Wait, the user's instruction says to only use the content given as context. So if the narrative doesn't mention the type of milk used, I shouldn't assume anything. Therefore, since there's no explicit information about cow or goat milk in the production, I can't confirm that the value chain is involved in producing cheese made from those milks.

So, based on the provided content alone, the answer should be an empty JSON because there's no mention of cow, goat, or mixed milk in the cheese production.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms, and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff, poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines, low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition, lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment, and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Bulgaria, and the value chain (VC) has a card ID of VC 08 BG. It talks about dairy farms in the region and their profitability depending on the price for raw milk, which relates to milk quality.

Looking at the key points: the narrative discusses milk quality indicators like cleanliness, absence of veterinary substances, freedom from pathogens, and no colostrum until seven days after calving. These are standard food safety measures but don't specify the type of milk used.

The narrative also mentions that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 to represent farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in Bulgarian mountain areas. The reference mountain chain is Western Stara Planina, specifically Godech Municipality in Sofia Province.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese from cow, goat, or a mix. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention the type of milk used for cheese production. It focuses more on the challenges faced by dairy farms regarding milk quality and the formation of the association to address these issues.

Since there's no direct information about the specific types of milk used in cheese production, I can't confirm that they're producing cheese from cow, goat, or a mix. Therefore, according to the instructions, if it's not involved in producing such cheeses, I should output an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2770 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is the Czech Republic and the value chain (VC) is labeled as VC 15 CZ. It talks about syrup producers who collect ingredients from mountain regions but process them nearby. They emphasize traditional knowledge and cultural traits associated with the mountains, which gives their products symbolic value distinguishing them from others.

The challenges they face are related to product valorization and marketing strategies, classified as "Current." The VC is described as Traditional, with innovation unspecified. Land use systems involved are Natural land, and local assets include both natural and cultural elements. It's noted that the VC isn't heavily reliant on tangible resources but uses intangible ones like culture.

Now, focusing on whether cheese production is mentioned: the narrative specifically discusses syrup producers. There's no mention of cheese or dairy products at all. Syrups are processed foods made from ingredients like fruits, flowers, or herbs, not milk derivatives. Cheese production would typically involve milk from cows, goats, or a mix, which isn't indicated here.

Therefore, since the value chain is about syrup production and doesn't relate to cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk, the correct response should be an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Serbia is the reference member state and talks about livestock husbandry being the main agricultural activity in the Zlatar Mountain area. It specifically highlights cattle breeding as the basis of the value chain, noting that there are a few small dairies. 

The narrative also discusses attempts to organize farmers for managing PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) Zlatar cheese, which suggests that cheese production is indeed part of this value chain. PDO cheeses typically have specific milk sources, and in this case, it's likely from the local cattle since they're mentioned as the primary livestock.

I don't see any mention of goat milk or a mix with other types of milk. The focus seems to be on cattle and their dairy products, particularly cheese. There are references to selling cheese to restaurants and shops, which further indicates that cheese production is a key part of this value chain.

So, putting it all together, the narrative clearly involves producing cheese from cow milk as part of the mountain value chain. Therefore, I should return the JSON with the ID provided.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions "Traditional Welsh artisinal Caerphilly cheese" which has a European Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. It talks about reliance on local and traditional knowledge for processing the cheese and cultural heritage tied to it. There's also mention of cheese being made in England, but the focus seems to be on the traditional methods from Caerphilly.

Now, I need to figure out what type of milk is used here. The term "Caerphilly cheese" typically refers to a type of cheese that can be made from cow's milk. However, sometimes goat's milk might also be used in some regions or variations. But the narrative doesn't explicitly state whether it's using cow, goat, or a mix.

Looking at the details, there's no mention of goat milk anywhere in the text. It focuses on traditional cheesemaking processes and local production methods but doesn't specify the type of milk. Since Caerphilly cheese is traditionally associated with cow's milk, I might lean towards that assumption. However, without explicit information about the milk source, I can't be certain.

The user's instruction is clear: if the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, include the ID; otherwise, return an empty JSON. Since the narrative doesn't specify the milk type but discusses traditional methods which are often associated with cow's milk, I might consider including the ID.

But wait, another angle: sometimes PGI status can be specific about ingredients. The narrative mentions PGI for both English and Welsh spellings, but it doesn't say anything about the milk source. So, without explicit info on milk type, maybe it's safer to assume that the cheese is made with cow's milk as per tradition.

Alternatively, if the user strictly requires only cases where the milk types are explicitly mentioned, then since it's not there, I should return an empty JSON. But given that Caerphilly is traditionally a cow's milk cheese and the narrative talks about traditional methods, perhaps it's implied.

I'm a bit torn here because the instructions say to use ONLY the content provided as context. Since the content doesn't mention the milk type, maybe I shouldn't assume. Therefore, the correct response would be an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain in Bulgaria, specifically mentioning cheese production. My task is to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the most commonly made cheeses are from sheep, cow, goat milk, or sometimes a mixture. That's a clear indication that they do produce cheese using these types of milk. The specific cheese mentioned is 'Sirene,' which I know is typically made from sheep's milk, but the narrative also includes other milks.

I need to check if there's any mention of not producing such cheeses or if it's focused on something else. From what I see, the challenges are about adding value and marketing, not about changing the type of cheese they produce. The focus is on improving their current products rather than moving away from them.

So, putting this together, since the narrative explicitly states that the cheeses are made from cow, goat, or a mix, including sheep, it definitely involves producing the specified types of cheese. Therefore, I should create a JSON with the given ID.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3114. Let me go through each sentence to see if there's any mention of cheese or milk types.

The narrative starts by mentioning Switzerland as the reference member state and talks about honey from the Alps having a gourmet taste. It says it's produced in small batches, sold directly by producers or nearby farm shops, and increasingly online. There are brands like 'Pro Montagna' for mountain products. However, I don't see any mention of cheese here.

The rest of the narrative goes into details about the area size, population stats, income levels, GVA, sector shares, etc., but none of these relate to cheese production. The focus is entirely on honey and alpine products in general, not specifically on dairy products like cheese made from cow or goat milk.

Since there's no information about cheese being produced using cow, goat, or mixed milk, I can conclude that this value chain isn't involved in such cheese production. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Now, looking at the milk sources: it says they use local milk from sheep and cow for high-quality products. So that's definitely involving cow milk. There's no mention of goat milk here, but since they're using cow milk, that's enough to trigger a response.

I should also check if there's any indication of mixing with goat milk or other types. The narrative doesn't specify any use of goat milk, so it's just cow milk in this case. But the requirement is whether they produce cheese with cow, goat, or a mix. Since cow milk is involved, the answer is yes.

Looking at the provided narrative for ID 3134: It mentions that the VC is composed of small scale farming where farmers produce and transform sheep's milk, selling cheese directly on the farm. The key point here is "sheep's milk." 

I need to check if any part of this involves cow or goat milk. Since it specifically says sheep's milk, there's no mention of cows or goats. Therefore, the value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or a mix of both milks.

So, the correct output should be an empty JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2868 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member states are Italy's UNIMOL and UNIPI. The key activities include organic cereal production and a bakery using bio-architecture principles. They're using photovoltaics and heat pumps for energy. It talks about closing the supply chain from grain production to bread processing. 

They mention innovation in the value chain, specifically visiting bakeries in France and Germany to improve their process. The focus is on producing bread with self-made grains and sourdough. The land use system is cropland, and local assets include sustainability, organic farms, quality.

Nowhere in this narrative do they talk about cheese production. They're focused on cereals and bread, not dairy products. There's no mention of milk, cows, goats, or any cheese-making process. So, the value chain here isn't involved in making cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2835. Let me go through each part to see if there's any mention of cheese or dairy products.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary and talks about cabbage production—red, white, cauliflower, etc. It mentions small farmers and a larger producer integrating them into their supply chain. The statistics are about employment in different sectors: primary, secondary, tertiary. 

It goes on to describe how they organize logistics, storage, processing, and trading of products. They're part of the European Territorial Quality Mark system. The challenges include marketing problems, competition from large-scale operations, climate issues like droughts and extreme weather, and maintaining producer interest.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese or dairy products. It's all about cabbage production—growing, integrating small farmers, processing, and marketing cabbages. There's no indication that the value chain deals with milk or cheese at all.

So, based on the content provided, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2906. Scanning the content, I notice mentions of several key actors: Maleshevo milk Berovo, Mlekara Malesh, Mlekara Natasha, and Farma Pacarski. These seem to be dairy-related businesses.

Next, there's a specific line that says, "There are meny individual families involved in producing sheep's cheese." Wait, "meny" is likely a typo for "many," so it means many families produce sheep's cheese. That's interesting because the user is asking about cow or goat milk cheese.

Sheep's cheese typically refers to products like feta or pecorino, which are made from sheep's milk. Since the narrative doesn't mention anything about cows or goats, just sheep, I don't see any indication that this value chain produces cheese from cow or goat milk.

I should also consider if there's any possibility of a mix, but again, the text only talks about sheep's cheese. There's no mention of other types of milk being used in production.

Therefore, based solely on the provided narrative, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow, goat, or a mix of both. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 FR. In Corsica, on-farm cheese making is defended by an association of farmers (of dairy goats and dairy ewes), Casgiu Casanu, which has existed since 1998 and has been locall

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2789 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that in Corsica, there's an association called Casgiu Casanu which has been around since 1998. It says they're farmers who work with dairy goats and dairy ewes. So, they're definitely involved in dairy production. The focus here is on cheese making on the farm.

Now, looking at the types of milk mentioned: it specifically talks about goat milk and sheep (ewes) milk. There's no mention of cow milk anywhere in the narrative. The association is defending on-farm cheese making using local breeds, which suggests they're sticking to traditional methods. 

The land use systems include grasslands, natural areas, and agrosylvopastoral systems with shrubs and oak forests. These are typical for grazing animals like goats and sheep. The assets mentioned are natural and cultural, which aligns with traditional cheese production.

It also notes that dairy husbandry and cheese production exist in other MRLs (which I assume stands for Monitoring Regions or something similar), but on-farm cheese making isn't unique to Corsica. However, their long-standing tradition shows how they combine old methods with new governance systems to stay resilient despite economic challenges.

So, putting it all together: the value chain here is producing cheese from goat and sheep milk, not cow milk. Since the question is about whether they produce cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, this narrative does involve cheese production but only with goat and sheep milk. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this case is involved in producing cheese made with goat milk.

Wait, but the user's instruction says if it's involved in producing cheese with cow, goat, or a mix, then include the ID. Since they're using goat and sheep, which are both non-cow, does that count? The example given includes any of those three options, so yes, this should be included.

I think I might have overcomplicated it at first, but now I'm confident that the answer is to include the ID because cheese production here involves goat milk.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3109. Let me go through each part:

- It mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland.
- The label "Gran Alpin" is for cereals produced organically above a certain altitude.
- It talks about supporting more varieties of cereal and how it's traditionally done.
- There are challenges like water scarcity, pests, and not enough farmers using the label.
- The value chain is classified as Innovative with endogenous innovation, focusing on marketing strategies and highlighting product quality.
- Land use systems involved are cropland, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production. Cheese typically involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. The narrative here is about cereals—specifically grains—and their organic production. There's no indication that the value chain processes milk in any form to make cheese. It seems focused on cereals and marketing them under the Gran Alpin label.

So, based on this analysis, there's no involvement with cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the value chain (VC) has a reference mountain chain called Jura. It talks about a cake produced by bakers in the canton or small local shops. 

Looking further, it states that the cake is made from flour and cream, which comes from the abundant dairy resources in the region. The production technique involves letting raw milk sit for several days, allowing the cream to rise and sour through bacterial transformation. This traditional method is highlighted as a cultural asset.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk. The narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese at all; it's about a cake made with cream from dairy resources. While dairy products can include both milk and cream, the specific focus here is on the cake's ingredients, not cheese production.

Cheese typically involves coagulating milk proteins (casein) using acids or enzymes, which isn't described in this narrative. The process mentioned is about souring cream through bacterial transformation, which might relate more to butter or cultured creams rather than cheese-making.

Additionally, the value chain is classified as Traditional and relates to a cake with strong territorial identity. There's no mention of cheese production steps or products. Therefore, based solely on the given content, I can't conclude that this mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID is 2792. The narrative mentions that the value chain is part of a greater one related to 'Corsican charcuterie.'

There's a part about linking with local breeders for meat adapted to deli meats, but again, that's about meat, not dairy products like cheese.

I should also consider if there are any indirect references. The mention of milk in the query is specifically cow or goat, or a mix. Since the narrative doesn't touch on milk at all, it's safe to assume cheese isn't part of this value chain.

Therefore, since there's no indication that the mountain value chain produces cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2759. The narrative mentions that the value chain's moving reference member state is the Czech Republic, and the reference card ID is VC 04 CZ. 

Looking at the farms involved, it says they focus on goat breeding, goat husbandry, grazing, and managing perennial grasslands. They implement organic farming methods. So far, this suggests that goats are a key part of their operations.

The narrative also mentions that most farms process their own milk. That's an important clue because if they're processing their own milk, it's likely being used for cheese production. The challenges faced include shortages during dry summers, which affects feedstuff availability but doesn't directly change the type of milk used.

Under innovation, it's noted that this VC develops new food products not commonly found in mainstream menus. Specifically, it mentions new products and marketing strategies. Since they're using goat milk, perhaps they're creating unique cheeses that aren't widely available elsewhere.

The land use systems include natural lands, grazing meadows, and grassland management, which supports the idea of dairy production from grazing animals like goats.

Putting this all together, the narrative clearly involves goat milk since the farms are breeding and processing their own. There's no mention of cow milk or a mix, so it's solely goat milk. Therefore, the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with goat milk.

In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The producers of the marmelade use these images in names of their producst and description. In this way they valorize symbolic resources of the given mountain region.    Main challenge for the viabitliy of this VC is economic pressure that comes from the competetive setting. Production of the high-quality marmelade competes with mainstream products that provide low-cost solution for consumers. The VC relies on the 'turn-to-quality' and focus on developing a niche market.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2763. Let me go through each paragraph to spot any mentions of cheese or dairy products.

The first part talks about the Czech Republic as the reference member state and mentions producers collecting products from mountain areas. It doesn't specify what those products are, though. Next, it discusses how producers create new marketing channels and use symbolic features like 'pure nature' and traditions. Still nothing concrete on cheese yet.

Then, the narrative shifts to Sumava Mountains, describing their picturesque landscape and history of being partly abandoned during socialism. Farms were renewed post-WWII, which is interesting but not directly related to dairy products. It mentions that the region attracts tourists in both winter and summer seasons, which again doesn't tie into cheese production.

The next paragraph introduces marmelade producers who use mountain imagery for their branding. Marmelade typically refers to jam or preserves, so this isn't about cheese either. The challenges faced by the VC include economic pressures from competition with mainstream low-cost products and the need to focus on niche markets. They mention that most marmelade producers aren't fruit growers but buy ingredients from others.

Looking at the type of innovation, it's both endogenous and exogenous, focusing on new food developments. However, all these points are about marmelade, not cheese.

So, after going through every part of the narrative, there's no mention of cheese, cows, goats, or any dairy products. The focus is entirely on marmelade production. Therefore, this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2823 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Greece, and the company Epirus SA operates there. It's noted as one of the largest cheese-producing companies in Greece. The activities include quality assurance, collection-transport of milk, quality control, processing, maturing, and packaging. They specifically mention producing "Epirus Feta," which I know from real-world knowledge is typically made from sheep's milk. However, since I'm supposed to rely only on the given content, I shouldn't assume that.

Looking at the narrative again, it says the main source of income for small animal husbandry farmers is milk production. The company processes this milk into cheese, but the type isn't specified here. It does mention a decline in milk production linked to an aging population and subsistence farming, which might affect the volume but not necessarily the type.

The reference mountain chain is Xerovouni/Pindos Mountain Range, and the landscape is Ammotopos. The climate there is described as warm, alpine, and dry, which can influence milk production, but again, that doesn't tell me about the specific milk types used.

Since the narrative doesn't explicitly state whether they use cow, goat, or a mix of both milks for their cheese, I have to consider if there's any implicit information. Epirus Feta is traditionally sheep's milk, but without explicit mention in the text, I can't confirm that. The activities listed don't specify the type of milk used.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no clear indication that the value chain produces cheese from cow, goat, or a mix of both milks. They might be using sheep's milk, but since it's not mentioned, I can't assume that.

The narrative does not explicitly mention whether the cheese is made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID is 3033, and the activities mentioned are herbs production and collection of wild herbs and forest fruits. Key actors include managers, workers, and consumers. Positive impacts on local SES are noted, but that's not directly relevant here.

Looking at the challenges, it mentions organic food processing without chemicals leading to shorter storage life. This suggests they're dealing with organic products, possibly herbs or fruits, given the activities listed.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous species of herbs and fruits produced in bio quality. The innovation relates to new processes involving environmental quality in mountains. Land use systems are cropland and forestry, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Other municipalities producing medicinal herbs are listed, but again, that's about herbs, not dairy products. There's no mention of cows, goats, or cheese production anywhere in the narrative.

So, putting it all together: the value chain is focused on herbs and forest fruits, specifically their organic production and processing. No indication exists that they produce cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2957. The narrative mentions that Romania is the reference member state and talks about production being divided between men and women. Men are described as potters who select and dig earth for ceramics. It also discusses marketing traditional mountain products, growing interest in online sales, and possible family cooperation.

Now, I need to check if there's any mention of cheese or milk processing. The narrative focuses on pottery and ceramics made from clay dug by the men. There's no indication that they're involved in dairy production or cheese-making. It talks about traditional mountain products but doesn't specify what those are beyond ceramics. 

I should also consider if "traditional mountain products" might include cheese, but without explicit mention, I can't assume that. The narrative doesn't provide any clues about milk sources like cow or goat. Therefore, based solely on the given content, there's no evidence that this value chain produces cheese.

So, since the narrative doesn't involve cheese production from cow, goat, or mixed milk, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' is a good example of a trout farm (https://www.pastravariabusteni.ro/) located in a mountain area (the Prahova River Valley) that is popular with tourists and therefore has a thriving business in direct sales of fresh trout and trout products - all registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT).   The key natural asset for a trout farm such as this is a clean (unpolluted) source of water - in this case, a local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain in Romania involving 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni'. My task is to determine if this value chain produces cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' started selling fresh Rainbow Trout in 2018 and has diversified into processing and selling various products, including 'catch-and-cook' items. They're located in a mountain area, specifically the Prahova River Valley, which is popular with tourists. Their products are registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's Optional Quality Term.

Now, focusing on what they produce: trout and trout products. The key natural asset here is clean water from a local mountain stream. The challenges mentioned relate to premium pricing, market competition, reliance on direct sales, and disruptions like COVID-19. They also discuss the type of value chain as Traditional with Current and Predicted challenges.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese production, especially using cow or goat milk. Scanning through the narrative again, I don't see any reference to cheese. Instead, it's all about trout—fresh and processed trout products. There's no indication that they're involved in dairy products like cheese.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain in question isn't producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 3002 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Serbia and the VC ID is VC 12 SER. It talks about donkeys being kept in natural environments, grazing on pastures or fed hay with some oat added when necessary. They follow organic production principles aimed at sustainable development. The challenges are current and predicted, and the value chain is both traditional and innovative.

The innovation type is endogenous and exogenous. Now, it says that donkey milk is a high-quality product but isn't widely used because each animal produces very little milk. It mentions that Balkan donkeys were once common in the area but have declined over the decades, with many being sold or slaughtered for meat.

The farm buys donkeys from Serbia and the region, providing them better living conditions. They sell donkey milk as a healthy drink and make soaps using it combined with local medical herbs. They're also planning to integrate the farm into rural tourism, offering tours where visitors can see how donkeys are milked and live.

The innovations relate to new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. The land use includes cropland, grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets are natural, social, and cultural.

Now, the key point is whether they produce cheese from cow, goat, or a mix of both. The narrative specifically mentions donkey milk being used for drinking and making soaps. There's no mention of cows or goats at all in this context. Cheese production typically involves these animals' milk, but since the focus here is on donkeys, it seems they aren't producing cheese from cow or goat milk.

Therefore, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow, goat, or a mix. So, I should return an empty JSON.

The narrative does not mention the production of cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk; instead, it focuses on donkey milk products like soap and beverages.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3082 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that there are six main types of cheeses in the area, shared across three provinces. It specifically highlights blue cheeses that are significant nationally and even compete internationally. These cheeses have certifications like PDOs (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGIs (Protected Geographical Indication), which usually indicate a specific production method or origin.

The narrative then talks about how these cheeses are linked to the social-ecological system, produced from the milk of animals grazing in common mountain pastures. It emphasizes that this is a symbolic element of the regional landscape. Additionally, caves have been used for generations to cure and store the cheese, contributing to its unique flavor.

Looking at the production details, it mentions that the cattle are grazed on areas with mild relief mountain pastures. However, there's no specific mention of whether these animals are cows, goats, or a mix. The narrative doesn't explicitly state which type of milk is used for the cheese production.

The geographical and climatic details describe the region as having a high mountain geography with peaks above 2000 meters, but again, this doesn't specify the type of dairy animals involved. The climate is described as temperate and humid, which is suitable for certain types of cheese, but without knowing the specific milk sources, it's hard to determine.

Since the narrative focuses on the production methods, certifications, and the landscape's role in cheese-making, but lacks explicit information about whether cow, goat, or mixed milk is used, I can't definitively say that the value chain produces cheese from these types of milk. Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there isn't enough evidence to conclude involvement in producing such cheeses.

The narrative does not explicitly mention whether the cheese is made using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. It focuses on production methods and certifications but lacks specific details about the milk sources.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production using cow, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't explicitly say anything about cheese. It focuses more on trout fishing and water quality for high-quality productions, which could include various food items but not specifically dairy products like cheese.

There's no indication of milk processing or cheese-making in the text. Instead, it emphasizes aquaculture and possibly other non-dairy agricultural products. So, based solely on this narrative, there's no evidence that the mountain value chain is involved in producing the specified cheeses.

It talks about Transylvania Lactate' which follows an integrated production-processing-marketing concept. They manage High Nature Value pastures for buffalo, make supplementary feed, ensure buffalo health, handle dairy production and processing, and product distribution.

The key here is to identify the type of milk used in their cheese production. The narrative specifically mentions that they produce Mozzarella. Now, I know that traditionally, Mozzarella is made from cow's milk, but sometimes it can be made from buffalo milk as well. However, the user is asking about cow, goat, or a mix.

Looking at the text, there's no mention of goats or goat milk anywhere. It focuses on buffaloes and their milk. Buffalo milk is different from both cow and goat milk, so unless they're using a mix that includes buffalo with either cow or goat, which isn't indicated here, it doesn't fit the criteria.

Additionally, the narrative emphasizes the premium nature of their Mozzarella, highlighting freshness, quality, and taste. They have state-of-the-art facilities and train their production teams, but again, no mention of using cow or goat milk.

So, putting this together, since the cheese in question is made from buffalo milk and there's no indication of mixing with cow or goat milk, the mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or a mix. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain, specifically ID 2810. They want me to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Greece, and the reference card ID is VC 05 GR. It talks about vineyards owned by cooperative members and their families. Processing capacity is mentioned as 700 tons in 12 hours, which sounds like it's related to wine production since they're talking about vinification.

The narrative goes on to discuss a farmers' co-operative of 10 local villages with a long tradition in wine production. It mentions challenges like sustainability and climate change affecting production levels and quality. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation types. They're interested in new commercial presentations, such as wines in Tetra Pak packaging and bag-in-box, which are more about standardization and marketing.

Looking through the narrative again, there's no mention of cheese production at all. It's focused entirely on wine—vineyards, vinification, processing capacity, cooperatives, challenges related to wine production, and innovations in wine products like packaging. There's nothing about dairy products, milk sources, or cheese-making processes.

So, based on the content provided, this value chain is involved with wine, not cheese. Therefore, it doesn't produce cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The answer should be an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain in France, specifically involving sheep farming and pastoralism in the Drôme valley. My task is to determine if this value chain produces cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions extensive sheep farming and pastoralism as key characteristics. The focus seems to be on sheep rather than cows or goats. There's talk about local slaughtering and direct sales, but it doesn't specify what products are being made from the milk. However, since the primary livestock here is sheep, it's likely that any dairy products would come from sheep milk.

I also note that the narrative discusses challenges like predation by wolves, droughts, and changes in consumer demand. These issues don't directly relate to cheese production but rather to the overall sustainability of the farming practices. The mention of organic sheep meat suggests that their product is meat-based, not dairy.

Additionally, the value chain's assets include providing ecosystem services through silvopastoralism and creating local added value through direct sales. Again, this points towards meat products rather than cheese. There's no indication of any cheese production, whether from cows, goats, or a mix.

Given all this information, it seems clear that the mountain value chain in question is focused on sheep farming for meat, not dairy. Therefore, they are not involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a combination of both.

The interest is linked to the coupling between the different human and non-human components on which the market and environmental value is based.   The value chain is linked to an organized association of different components.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the MOVING reference member state is FRANCE INRAE, and the activity revolves around several organizations, including PDOs (Protected Designation of Origin). It talks about small-scale on-farm processors using local pigs from the nustrale breed, reared in extensive conditions with chestnuts and acorns. The products are described as being made by these processors.

Now, focusing on the key details: the narrative discusses the production of certain PDO products, specifically mentioning that they're made from local pigs. It also highlights the use of traditional knowledge in processing and tasting. However, when I look for mentions of cheese or dairy products, there's nothing about milk types like cow, goat, or a mix.

The challenges mentioned are related to maintaining farming, processing, and environmental resources, particularly concerning chestnut groves and oak trees. There's talk about disease threats to chestnuts and how to manage common resources between harvest and breeding. The innovations described involve breed standards, strategic breeding periods, finishing feed, and new processing techniques like gentle salting of the prisuttu.

Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all and instead focuses on pork products from local pigs, it's clear that this value chain isn't involved in dairy or cheese production. Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that Mila is a cooperative focused on mountain farming and dairy products. It highlights their mission to uphold the South Tyrolean dairy industry and produce high-quality products. They also mention being the first producer of SKYR in Italy, which originates from Iceland.

Now, looking at the key details: SKYR is described as a dairy specialty made with "100% hay milk" from the South Tyrolean mountains. The term "hay milk" typically refers to milk that comes from cows fed on fresh grass or hay, so it's likely cow milk. There's no mention of goat milk or any mixtures in the narrative.

I should also consider if there are any other clues about the type of milk used. The narrative emphasizes quality products and working with nature, focusing on animal welfare and resource handling, but again, nothing points towards goat milk or a mixture.

Since the narrative specifically mentions SKYR made with 100% hay milk, which is cow milk, it's clear that this value chain produces cheese using cow milk. There's no indication of goat milk involvement here.

Therefore, according to the guidelines, I should output a JSON containing the ID of the narrative since it does involve producing cheese with cow milk.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2842. Let me go through each sentence to see if there's any mention of cheese or milk types.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary and the VC ID is VC 17 HU. It talks about homemade pasta free of additives, made from flour and eggs. They produce raw materials almost entirely themselves and have sales channels. There are challenges related to labor supply and work ethic, classified as Current and Predicted issues.

The value chain is described as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation types are Endogenous and Exogenous. Activities include pasta preparation, hen keeping, and flour grinding, which are traditional. It's implemented by a social enterprise initiated by the local municipality for employment and revenue. They produce large quantities of pasta sold in grocery stores, packaged nicely, preservative-free, and healthy.

The innovations relate to governance systems, with land use involving cropland and hen houses. Local assets include natural and social aspects.

Now, looking for any mention of cheese or milk types. The narrative is about pasta production, specifically homemade pasta using flour and eggs. There's no indication that they produce cheese at all. They focus on pasta as their main product, with an emphasis on traditional methods and a social enterprise model.

Since the query is about cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk, and there's nothing in the narrative pointing towards cheese production, I can conclude that this value chain isn't involved in making such cheeses.

Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain in the given narrative produces cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it does, I'll output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative is about a Value Chain (VC) based in the Czech Republic, specifically referencing VC 10 CZ. It mentions that the primary product is herb liquers, which are not mainstream but niche market items. Producers are mostly located in the region but don't have to be.

Looking at the details provided, there's information about agricultural holdings and employment sectors, but nothing directly related to cheese production. The VC focuses on producing herb liquers of various flavors, positioning them as a regional product. They utilize natural and symbolic assets of the area, emphasizing traditional knowledge and cultural traits associated with the mountain region.

Now, I need to check if any part of this narrative mentions cheese or milk types used in their products. Scanning through, the key points are about liquers, not dairy products like cheese. The emphasis is on herbs and regional branding, not on milk sources for cheese.

Since there's no mention of cheese production, cow milk, goat milk, or any mix thereof, it seems clear that this value chain isn't involved in producing such cheeses. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2845 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative says that the value chain's key activities include collecting truffles, making special processed products, and organizing truffle collecting tours. They use forest areas environmentally for collecting truffles and market their tours. The challenges they face are current and predicted, and they're classified as innovative with exogenous innovation. 

Looking at the processed products mentioned: truffle stuffed cheese, oil with truffle, salt with truffle. So, one of the products is truffle stuffed cheese. That suggests that cheese is involved in their value chain.

Now, I need to determine if this cheese is made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't specify which type of milk is used for the cheese. It just mentions that they make special processed products, including truffle stuffed cheese. Since it's not explicitly stated whether it's cow, goat, or a mix, I can't assume any particular type.

Therefore, since there's no information about the milk source, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON. Instead, I'll return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that "Milk lamb is seasonnaly produced, mostly in autumn, by approximately 300 dairy-ewe farmers." The term "milk lamb" seems a bit unusual, but given the context, it likely refers to sheep's milk, as ewes are female sheep. So, this suggests that the value chain is producing cheese from goat milk or perhaps sheep milk.

Next, I'll look for any mention of cows or cow milk in the narrative. Scanning through, there's no reference to cows or dairy products derived from them. The focus is on dairy-ewe farmers and slaughtering animals, which points more towards sheep rather than goats or cows.

The narrative also mentions associations of farmers involved in slaughter and resource use but doesn't specify cheese production. However, the key point here is that it's about milk lamb, which aligns with sheep milk. Since the query includes goat milk as a possible option, I need to consider if sheep milk falls under the same category or not.

In many contexts, goat and sheep milk are both considered in similar categories for cheese production, especially in regions where these animals are commonly farmed. However, the user specifically mentioned cow, goat, or a mix. Sheep's milk isn't explicitly listed, but it's close to goat milk in terms of dairy products.

But wait, the query is about whether the value chain produces cheese made with cow, goat, or a mix. Since the narrative doesn't mention goats either, only sheep (ewes), I need to determine if sheep's milk cheese would fall under the same category as goat milk. In some cases, yes, but in others, it might not.

Given that the user provided an example where goat milk was included, perhaps they consider both goat and sheep milk under similar categories. However, without explicit mention of goats or cows, I'm on uncertain ground here.

Looking back at the narrative, there's no direct indication that cheese is being produced. It talks about milk lamb production and slaughter, which might relate to meat rather than dairy products. So, even though it's sheep milk, if the focus isn't on cheese but on meat, then the value chain isn't involved in cheese production.

Therefore, considering all this, the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese made from cow, goat, or a mix of both. It focuses more on the production and slaughter of sheep for their milk, which might not necessarily translate to cheese unless specified.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2916. Let me go through each part:

- It mentions that the reference member state is NMK and the VC ID is VC 19 NMK.
- Key actors are listed as dealing with honey in Maleshevija: Pcelarstvo Bobolibbksi, Shumi Med, Maleshevski Med, and Pcelarstvo Radinski. So, they're involved in honey production.
- It talks about the biodiversity of honey flora, noting that 98% is polyfloral and only 2% is monofloral from white acacia.
- The challenges include climate change, pollution, land use affecting bees, and issues with chemical use by farmers and beekeepers. These factors are threatening honey production in the area.
- The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous innovation related to new processes.
- It mentions that honey is present in other member states but doesn't elaborate on cheese or dairy products.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese. The narrative focuses entirely on honey production—key actors are beekeepers, challenges relate to honeybees and honey quality, and innovations are about honey processes. There's no mention of cheese, milk processing, cows, goats, or any dairy products at all.

So, since the entire narrative is centered around honey and not cheese made from cow or goat milk, I conclude that this value chain isn't involved in producing such cheeses.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the cooperative is called ARGE Glocknerlamm and was founded in 2003. The key product here is lamb, specifically from traditional sheep races. They process and sell lamb products to private consumers. 

The region is in the highest mountains of Austria, which limits farming practices, making sheep farming a primary income source. There's mention of climate change affecting biodiversity and water balance but that's more about challenges than production specifics.

Looking for any clues related to cheese: The narrative doesn't explicitly say they produce cheese. It focuses on lamb products, which could include meat or maybe some processed goods, but nothing about dairy products like cheese. They're marketing it as a local specialty, but again, the emphasis is on sheep and their products, not milk-based cheeses.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of cheese. Sometimes, cooperatives might handle multiple products, but in this case, all references point to lamb. There's no mention of cows or goats, which are needed for cow or goat milk cheese. 

Additionally, the narrative classifies the VC as traditional and innovative, with endogenous innovation related to marketing strategies. This suggests they're focusing on their core product—sheep products—and enhancing how they market it, not diversifying into dairy.

So, putting it all together: The value chain is centered around sheep farming and lamb products. There's no indication that they produce cheese from cow, goat, or a mix of milks. Therefore, the correct response should be an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2842. Let me go through each part.

The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Hungary, and the VC is 17 HU. It talks about homemade pasta free of additives, made from flour and eggs. They produce raw materials locally, using their own mills and eggs. The products are sold in local grocery stores, packaged nicely, and it's a social enterprise.

Next, it describes the reference mountain chain as Northern Medium Mountains, specifically Múcsony village. There's information about the area size, population stats, income levels, etc., but nothing related to cheese production here.

Now, focusing on the key points: the main product is pasta made from flour and eggs. There's no mention of milk or cheese anywhere in the narrative. The value chain seems focused on pasta manufacturing, not dairy products.

So, since the narrative doesn't involve cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I shouldn't include any JSON with an ID. Instead, I'll return an empty JSON as specified.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Switzerland and the value chain (VC) is labeled as VC 10 CH1. It talks about a major beer brand, 'Appenzellerbier,' which uses barley from mountain regions and many smaller breweries producing various types of beer. 

The key points here are:
- The value chain involves beer production.
- They use mountain grains, specifically barley, to make craft beers.
- There's mention of innovative use of traditional grain varieties leading to new 'mountain beers.'
- Challenges include water scarcity and the fact that not enough grain is produced locally, so some is imported.

Now, I'm looking for any indication related to cheese production. The narrative doesn't mention cheese at all. It focuses entirely on beer—types of beer, production methods, marketing strategies, and challenges faced in the industry. There's no reference to dairy products, milk sources, or cheese-making processes.

Since the value chain is centered around beer rather than dairy, it's clear that they're not involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should output an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the mountain value chain described in narrative 2954 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the narrative mentions that the reference member state is Romania, and the Value Chain (VC) has an ID of VC 13 RO. The cheese in question is 'Brănză Horezu,' which was first produced in Horezu, a town in the mountainous region of northern Vâlcea County in 2001.

The key part here is that all milk used for cheese production is collected from... well, it doesn't specify whether it's cow, goat, or a mix. The narrative does mention that the Romanian Authority regulates the market for 'Mountain Products' and ensures producers have the necessary authorization to use the OQT (which I assume stands for Origin Quality Taste, a certification mark) and that labeling complies with national regulations.

Since the cheese is called 'Brănză Horezu,' which sounds traditional, I'm trying to recall if this is a specific type of Romanian cheese. From what I remember, Brănză is typically a sheep's milk cheese, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the narrative doesn't explicitly state that it's made from sheep's milk or any other type.

Given that the problem asks whether the value chain produces cheese using cow, goat, or a mix of both, and since the narrative doesn't provide specific information about the type of milk used, I can't confirm that they're producing cheese with those types. Therefore, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence to suggest involvement in producing such cheeses.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the value chain (VC) ID is VC 11 FR. It talks about milk lamb being seasonally produced, mostly in autumn, by approximately 300 dairy-ewe farmers. So, ewes are female sheep, which means they produce sheep's milk.

The narrative goes on to discuss issues with milk lambs and how dairy producers have specialized in producing milk but don't know what to do with the lambs. It also mentions that local culinary uses are diminishing, contributing to restrained local markets. The focus seems to be on pastoral breeding, breeds, feeding species, and their associated know-how.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain is involved in cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. From the narrative, it's clear that the primary product mentioned is sheep's milk (from dairy ewes). There's no mention of cows or goats being part of the milking process here.

Cheese can be made from various types of milk, but in this case, the emphasis is on sheep's milk. Since the user is asking specifically about cow, goat, or a mix, and there's no indication that these are involved, I should conclude that the value chain isn't producing cheese from those sources.

Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object as specified.

It talks about the Drome stone fruit value chain, which primarily produces peaches and apricots on orchards averaging 15 hectares.

The challenges they face include dealing with freezing episodes due to climate change and diversifying their crops to more adaptable ones like grenades (I think that's a type of fruit) and almonds. They're also relying on regional public aids because of the climatic crisis. The value chain is classified as Traditional, but the innovation part isn't specified. However, the innovation here seems to be about adapting to climate change by diversifying their crops.

- It mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the VC ID is VC 08 FR.
- The product in question is "Autumn honey," specifically made almost exclusively from arbutus unedo honey. They highlight its bitter taste as a distinguishing feature.
- There's a challenge related to increasing drought due to global warming, classified under Current challenges.
- The value chain is both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. The innovation involves marketing strategies targeting European connoisseurs and preserving arbutus unedo stands, which have decreased in the Mediterranean due to fires and droughts.
- Land use systems are Natural, and local assets include Natural aspects.
- It's present in several MRLs: Austria, Czech Republic, Crete, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese. The narrative talks about honey production, not cheese. Honey is a dairy product but made from bees, not cows or goats. Cheese typically comes from milk, which isn't mentioned here. There's no reference to milking animals or cheese-making processes in the text.

So, since the focus is on honey and not cheese, this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese with cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

lim weaving in Chiprovtsi Municipality (MON36) is considered an important part of Bulgarian national heritage and was inscribed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2014.   A combination of assets are used: the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) plus the cultural heritage of the Kilim weaving tradition.    Whilst local sheep production remains a reliable source of wool, the local kilim industry has declined in recent years because of the loss of important markets - especially the lucrative, but very competitive, international market. Consequently the town and municipality have above average levels of unemployment with associated population loss and on-going demographic decline. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain in Bulgaria, specifically involving kilim production from sheep wool. My task is to determine if this value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it does, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the Moving reference member state is Bulgaria, and the Value Chain (VC) has a reference Card ID of VC 05 BG. It talks about kilim production, which involves sheep grazing on mountain pastures and the processing of their wool into kilims. These kilims are woven in Chiprovtsi Municipality and are recognized by UNESCO as part of Bulgarian heritage.

The narrative also discusses the decline in the local kilim industry due to loss of markets, leading to unemployment and population decline. It classifies this VC as Traditional with unspecified innovation, involving grassland land use systems and natural and cultural assets.

Now, I need to focus on whether cheese production is mentioned or implied here. The key points are about sheep grazing for wool and kilim weaving. There's no mention of dairy products like cheese. Cheese typically comes from milk, but the narrative doesn't specify which type of milk—cow, goat, or a mix—is used. It's all about wool and textiles.

Since the narrative is centered around sheep wool production and traditional weaving, there's no indication that cheese is part of this value chain. Therefore, it doesn't involve producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID is 3071, and the narrative mentions Spain as the reference member state, specifically ADEGUA. It talks about production in small orchards for both dry and irrigated land, focusing on high-quality fruits. The products mentioned include quince juice, vinegar (both sweet and dry), and there's a note about nearby areas producing quince jam.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products. The narrative doesn't use the words "cheese," "cow milk," "goat milk," or any related terms. Instead, it's all about quince-based products like juice and vinegar. Even though there are mentions of other nearby productions like quince jam, none of these relate to cheese.

So, based on the content provided, this value chain isn't involved in cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3006 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative mentions that the main activities include various tours and touristic offers by the Adventure Network. It talks about outdoor festivals, hiking, sky running, yoga retreats, etc. So tourism seems to be a big part of this value chain.

Then it discusses environmental impacts like poor waste management, construction in protected areas, pollution of rivers and Lake Zavoj. These are issues related to economic activities affecting the environment.

Next, it says that the prevailing farming is livestock production, specifically sheep and cows, used for meat and milk. They also produce milk and dairy products. So there's definitely milk involved here. The narrative mentions two autochthonous breeds: Karakachan sheep and Busha cattle. These are local breeds, but their numbers are decreasing.

The challenge faced is both current and predicted, which probably relates to the sustainability of these practices. The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. They're creating new touristic offers that align with sustainability and nature protection, aiming to preserve local identity and cultural assets.

So putting this together: The narrative talks about milk production from cows and sheep. Since cheese can be made from cow or goat milk, but here it's specifically mentioning cows and sheep (which are not goats), I need to see if they make cheese from these milks.

The text says they produce milk and dairy products. Cheese is a dairy product, so it's likely that the value chain does produce cheese. However, since the narrative doesn't explicitly mention goat milk, only cow and sheep milk, but the question allows for cow, goat, or a mix. Since cows are involved, even without goats, they're producing cheese from cow milk.

Therefore, the mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

The rate of producers trained in mushroom production is 9.4% (Şahin, 2019). The value chain has positive effects on the environment. Agricultural wastes (wheat stalk, chicken manure, cotton pulp, etc.) are used in compost production. These wastes are transformed into a product with high economic and nutritional value. The fact that the climate of the region is suitable for mushroom cultivation reduces the costs of climatization. The region is close to raw material sources for mushroom cultivation. This reduces logistics costs. The short shelf life of the product is a major disadvantage for small family farms. Because most of the small family farms do not have the necessary infrastructure for the processing and distribution of the product.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3150. Let me go through each part of the narrative to see if there's any mention related to cheese production or milk sources.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Turkey and the VC ID is VC 03 TR. It lists key actors as mushroom compost suppliers, spawn suppliers, small-scale farmers, traders, producer unions, retailers, and consumers. The activities include input supply, growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, logistics, marketing, sales, and purchasing.

Next, it states that 96% of mushroom production in Korkuteli is done by small family farms, with 94% sold to traders. There's a note about the training rate for producers and some environmental benefits from using agricultural waste for compost. It also mentions the region's suitability for mushroom cultivation due to climate and proximity to raw materials, which reduces costs.

The reference mountain chain is the Bey mountains in Antalya, with Korkuteli as the landscape. The narrative emphasizes mushroom production but doesn't mention cheese at all. There's no talk about milk sources or dairy products anywhere in the text.

So, after reviewing everything, it's clear that this value chain is focused on mushrooms, not cheese. Since there's no connection to cow, goat, or mixed milk cheeses, I shouldn't include any ID in the JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2915. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is NMK, and the top 15 wineries are part of Wines of Macedonia. They work together to represent their wines in expert markets. It also talks about Maleshevija as a reference region and mentions challenges faced by the VC as both current and predicted.

Looking at the key points: The value chain is related to wineries, specifically focusing on wine production. There's no mention of cheese or dairy products anywhere in the narrative. The innovations mentioned are new processes and marketing strategies, but these seem to be applied to wine rather than cheese.

I should also consider if there's any indirect connection, like whether the same value chain might produce both wine and cheese. However, the narrative explicitly talks about wineries and their activities, which don't include dairy or cheese production. The local assets mentioned are natural, social, and cultural, but again, nothing related to dairy farming or cheese-making.

Since the focus is solely on wine, it's clear that this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return an empty JSON object.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3139. Let me go through each part:

- It mentions that the value chain (VC) is composed only of farms producing, processing, and selling resources directly on the farm.
- Some external and local inputs are used for coloring and flavoring. 
- Employment statistics are given across different sectors, but I don't think that's relevant here.
- The primary product is described as a high-quality item produced, processed, and sold at the farm level. It specifically mentions mustard as an often industrial and highly consumed product.
- Innovation comes from production processes and local transformation in direct sales. They use local products like wild garlic for flavoring and coloring mustards.
- Production is based on traditional knowledge with no major challenges mentioned; it's classified as Current, Traditional, and Innovative.
- The innovation type is both Endogenous and Exogenous, involving entirely local and artisanal production focused on new processes.
- Land use systems are Cropland, and local assets include Cultural aspects.

Now, the key point here is that the narrative talks about mustard production. Mustard is a condiment made from ground mustard seeds, typically flavored with ingredients like wild garlic. There's no mention of cheese or dairy products anywhere in the text. Cheese would involve milk processing, which isn't discussed here. The focus is entirely on mustard and its production methods.

So, since the value chain is about mustard and not cheese, I shouldn't include any ID in the JSON response. Instead, I'll return an empty JSON as specified.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The VC is focused on creating Local Gastronomic Points in rural mountain areas. These points allow visitors to experience local cuisine, which includes food and drink from individual households. The main challenges mentioned are consistency of product quality, food safety, and hygiene. They've partnered with public health authorities to create a guide for compliance.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production or the types of milk used. Scanning through, there's no specific reference to cheese being produced. The narrative talks about local food and drink but doesn't specify what that includes beyond general terms like "culinary experience" and "local food and drink."

I should consider if there are indirect clues. For example, if they're selling increased quantities of local food and drink, maybe cheese is part of it. However, without explicit mention, I can't assume. The focus seems more on establishing guidelines for safe and compliant Local Gastronomic Points rather than the specific products being sold.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that this value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3128 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Switzerland 2, and the value chain (VC) has a reference card ID VC 01 CH2. It talks about a malthouse with 34 members, including farmers, breweries, malt processors, and others interested in regional brewing.

Next, it discusses the mountain chain as Jura and references specific landscapes like Orvin, Bourrignon, etc. The area is described as having limestone rocks, shallow valleys, high plateaus, forests, and wooded pastures. It mentions that milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resources of the massif. 

So, here's where I need to focus: the narrative explicitly states that "milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif." This directly indicates that cheese is being produced in this region.

Now, the question is about whether the cheese is made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't specify which type of milk is used for cheese production. However, it does mention that the region has a cultural heritage related to clock-making by farmers since the Middle Ages. While this might suggest a historical context, it doesn't provide information about the type of dairy products.

In Switzerland, particularly in regions like Jura, traditional cheeses are often made from cow's milk. Goat's milk cheese is less common but still possible. However, without explicit mention, I can't be certain if goat's milk or a mix is used here.

But wait, the narrative does say that milk and cheese production are significant. Since it doesn't specify the type of milk, I might infer that cow's milk is more likely given Switzerland's dairy industry prominence. Alternatively, maybe they use a mix, but again, no info is provided.

Given that the problem asks to recognize if the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, and since the narrative does mention cheese production without excluding any type, I think it's safe to assume involvement. Even though the exact milk types aren't specified, the presence of dairy farming (as indicated by milk production) suggests that cheese is part of their value chain.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain in narrative 3128 is involved in producing cheese, likely from cow's milk, but possibly including goat's milk or a mix. Since the problem allows for any of these possibilities, I should include the id.

On top of that come the problems posed by the effects of climate change such as drought, late season frost, etc. In addition, while for the cultivation of blue berries stable production and quality via applying cultivation techniques can be assured, this does not apply for wild berry picking which is dependent on local climatic and soil conditions.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that there are 6 main types of cheeses in the area, shared by three provinces. It specifically highlights blue cheeses that stand out nationwide and even compete internationally. 

Next, I look for any mention of milk sources. The text talks about land use systems involving grassland and animal skin/leather, but it doesn't specify which animals are being referred to. Since cheese typically comes from dairy cows or goats, I'm wondering if the absence of explicit mentions means they're not using these milks.

The narrative also discusses innovations related to e-commerce strategies and geographical certifications, as well as new marketing strategies. However, none of these points indicate the type of milk used in cheese production.

Considering that blue cheeses are often associated with cow's milk, but goat's milk can also be used for certain types, I'm still on the fence. The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether they're using cow, goat, or a mix. Without clear information about the milk sources, it's safer to assume that the value chain isn't specifically involved in producing cheese from these milks.

Therefore, based solely on the content provided and avoiding any external knowledge, I conclude that there's no evidence indicating the involvement in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2719. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is Austria, and the value chain (VC) is focused on beef quality. It talks about suckler cow husbandry, oxen, and the Murbodener cattle breed. 

The key points I notice are:
- The VC involves registered animals in a beef quality program.
- They focus on animal husbandry, butchering know-how, and preserving an autochthonous cattle breed.
- There's mention of pasture farming contributing to landscape preservation and cultural heritage.

Now, the question is about cheese production. Cheese typically comes from milk, so I'm looking for any references to milk processing or cheese-making in the narrative. The narrative doesn't mention anything about milk types—cow, goat, or a mix. It's all about beef production, breeding, and meat quality.

I also consider if there's any indirect link, like by-products, but nothing stands out. The focus is clearly on meat, not dairy products. Therefore, the value chain isn't involved in cheese production as described.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain in Maleshevija and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the main company involved is Makedonski Shumi, which deals with forestry and wood in the region. It talks about pine forests, oak forests, beech forests, and how wood is processed for various industries. There's a lot about firewood usage, challenges related to deforestation, and the classification of the value chain as Traditional and Innovative.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of dairy products, specifically cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Scanning through the text, I don't see any references to dairy farming, cheese production, or related activities. The focus is entirely on forestry and wood processing. Even though there's a part about households using firewood for heating, which might relate to rural areas where dairy could be common, the narrative doesn't connect that to cheese production.

I also note that the challenges mentioned are about deforestation and forest crimes, not about agricultural practices or dairy issues. There's no mention of milk processing, cheese factories, or any related terms. The value chain here is centered around wood and forestry resources, not livestock or dairy products.

Therefore, based on the content provided, it seems clear that this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk. So, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a narrative about a mountain value chain, and I need to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I have to write a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

Looking at the narrative provided: The ID is 2860. It mentions that the value chain (VC) involves ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI as reference members. The primary sectors are not very high in employment, but the secondary sector is around 28% in the province and 31% in the region. Tertiary is the highest.

The main actor here is a young farmer's son who produces high-quality organic honey. He uses innovative methods like barrel-aged honey and mead production. The farmlands are used for sunflower honey, while forests provide traditional Acacia honey. He collaborates with local dairy and catering activities for marketing.

Now, the key point is whether cheese made from cow, goat milk, or a mix is involved. The narrative talks about honey production, not cheese. Even though he collaborates with dairies, there's no mention of cheese production in the value chain itself. It's more about honey and mead, which are different products.

So, since the mountain value chain here is focused on honey and not cheese, I shouldn't include an ID. The JSON should be empty.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in the given narrative produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary and the VC ID is 16 HU. The business was launched in 2010 by a chemical engineer couple who farm with their family. They produce and sell wine, specifically Chardonnay, which I know is a type of white wine. 

Looking further, they mention organic products like vegetables and fruits but don't talk about cheese at all. Their main products are wines, sold through various channels like their webshop, Facebook, hotels, restaurants, and in Budapest. They also use their vineyards for events and communication.

There's no mention of dairy products, milk types, or cheese production anywhere in the narrative. The focus seems to be on wine and maybe some organic vegetables and fruits, but nothing about cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

So, based on this, I don't think the mountain value chain is involved in producing cheese with cow, goat, or a mix of both. Therefore, the JSON should be empty.

The narrative does not mention cheese production, focusing instead on wine and organic produce.

If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the VC 12 UK. It talks about Welsh Lamb being designated with a PGI mark since 2003, highlighting it as one of the best lamb in the world. The processes involved are traditional non-intensive rearing methods.

Looking further, the narrative discusses natural assets related to land maintenance, social assets with good relationships within and across the VC, and cultural aspects tied to traditional knowledge for lamb rearing. It also outlines threats like cost increases due to Brexit and COVID, as well as challenges from climate change affecting land use and rainfall. Additionally, it mentions the closure of a local abattoir in early 2021 and a significant decrease in such facilities over time.

The VC is classified as Traditional with unspecified innovation. The land use systems are grassland and natural land, and the local assets include natural, social, and cultural elements. It also notes that Welsh lamb is produced across Wales and mentions other regions in Scotland and Northern England where lamb and mutton are reared.

Now, I need to check if this VC produces cheese from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative focuses entirely on lamb production—PGI for Welsh Lamb, challenges related to lamb farming, abattoirs processing lamb, etc. There's no mention of dairy products, cheese, cows, goats, or any milk-based products.

Therefore, since the value chain is centered around lamb and not cheese made from cow or goat milk, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

It has about 600 farmers and small-scale food processors, including bakeries and alpine dairies. Their aim is to support organic farming and sustain the cultural landscape.

Now, I need to check if any information about the type of milk used in their cheese production is provided. The narrative doesn't explicitly state whether the cheese is made from cow's milk, goat's milk, or a mix. It only mentions that they produce various types of cheese but doesn't specify the milk sources.

Since there's no explicit mention of the milk type, I can't confirm if it's cow, goat, or a mix. Therefore, according to the instructions, if the value chain isn't involved in producing cheese with those specific milks, I should output an empty JSON.

The narrative mentions that the value chain (VC) is in the Czech Republic, specifically referring to the 'Valašský' region and Beskydy mountains.

Looking at the details, the narrative describes a cake that's been around for 200 years, primarily using pears as a topping. The focus is on the region's identity and marketing, not so much on the production process or raw materials. There's no mention of cheese anywhere in the text. Instead, it's about a traditional cake from the Vallachian region.

I need to determine if this VC produces cheese. Since the narrative doesn't mention cheese at all but rather a cake, it seems unrelated. Cheese production would typically involve milk from cows or goats, but there's no indication of that here. The emphasis is on the regional name and the symbolic aspect tied to the mountains for marketing purposes.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2728. Let me go through each sentence to see if there's any mention of cheese or dairy products.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC04 AT. It talks about four fish farmers who have teamed up, emphasizing solidarity-based cooperation. One farm breeds fish from eggs and supplies seedlings to others. Another doesn't market the fish but supplies them to other farms. The others sell directly to consumers, gastronomy, and retailers. Additionally, one of these runs a restaurant, sells processed fish products like smoked fish, and offers educational events about fish.

The narrative mentions that fish farming isn't usual for the region and is responding to increased demand for domestic freshwater fish. It's classified as innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation related to new products and marketing strategies. The land use system involved is fish farming, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

There's a mention of 'Almenland Fish' not being traditional Austrian food but important for the Almenland region. It also notes that in Austria, other regions have similar setups where fish is the lead product of a 'Genussregion,' promoting local specialties with quality standards.

Nowhere in this narrative do I see any reference to cheese production. The focus is entirely on fish farming and related activities like processing, marketing, and education about fish. There's no mention of dairy products, milk sources (cow or goat), or cheese-making processes.

Therefore, since the value chain here is centered around fish rather than dairy products, it doesn't involve producing cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.
</think>

The narrative describes a value chain focused on fish farming and related activities, not involving cheese production. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Read the Narrative:** The narrative centers on four Austrian fish farmers involved in breeding, supplying, and selling fish, including processed products like smoked fish.

2. **Identify Keywords:** Look for terms related to dairy or cheese (e.g., cow milk, goat milk, cheese). None are present.

3. **Focus Areas:** The value chain's activities revolve around aquaculture, marketing strategies, and local promotion, not dairy processing.

4. **Conclusion:** Since there's no mention of cheese production using cow or goat milk, the value chain isn't involved in such activities.

However, other retailers are used moderately in product sales. It is seen that the farmers also sell pears directly to the hotels since it is in the tourism region of Korkuteli. However, direct sales are very low. One of the marketing channels used less frequently by the farmers is the brokers in the wholesale market.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3153 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Turkey and the reference card ID is VC 06 TR. It talks about Karyağdı Pear being the product, not cheese. The leading marketing channels are local merchants, non-local merchants, companies, but they don't sell to supermarkets much. They do sell directly to hotels because it's a tourism area in Korkuteli.

It also mentions that direct sales are low and brokers in wholesale markets aren't used much. There's a geographical indication certificate for the pears obtained in 2018, which is expected to help increase demand. The producers don't have a farmer organization yet.

The reference mountain chain is the Bey mountains in Antalya, with Korkuteli as the landscape. It describes Korkuteli as part of the Taurus Mountains, specifically the western range called Bey Dağları.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or milk production. The focus is entirely on pears and their marketing strategies. There's no indication that the value chain involves dairy products, let alone cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 35 IT. The Di Iorio family is at the heart of the VC that connects several SESs to supply raw materials traditionally used in traditional desserts. The company has seve
an root materials (almonds, sugar, flour, butter, etc.). In the SES, the production of nougat is traditional. However, the 'Di Iorio' factory has diversified its production with other conventional Italian confectionery products and innovated the products more in line with consumers' needs and interests. The company has also invested in online commerce. They stress high-quality productions and their awards.   Gastronomic and confectionery culture is predominant in this VC. Several local products, such as honey, are used for production, but historically other products come from other SESs. Thus the VC connects several SES. However, strong connections with local agricultural production are not stressed.    In the high-quality traditional confectionery sector, innovation and the origin of raw materials are competitive factors. In the case of 'Di Iorio', innovation crosses local (i.e., nougat) and national (panettone, Easter eggs, dove bread, etc.) gastronomic culture. However, the origin of the raw materials is not always local. Although this is not in contradiction with the local tradition (since the Romans time, the SES is connected by trades with distant areas), it may pose a problem in communication strategies. For example, in the case of nougat, traditionally, almonds come from the Apulia region while honey is local. At the same time, in the business communication lacks a link with the local social context and environment settings. Overall the type of challenge faced by this

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 2873. The narrative mentions that the Di Iorio family is at the heart of this value chain, connecting several SESs (which I assume stands for something like Small Economic Systems or similar). They supply raw materials traditionally used in traditional desserts.

The key points from the narrative are:
- The company produces nougat and other conventional Italian confectionery products.
- They've diversified into other products and invested in online commerce.
- Emphasis is on high-quality production and innovation, aligning with consumer trends.
- Local gastronomic culture is predominant, but raw materials aren't always local. For example, almonds for nougat come from Apulia, while honey is local.

Now, the question is about cheese production using cow, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't mention anything related to cheese at all. It's focused on confectionery products like nougat, panettone, Easter eggs, etc. There's no indication of dairy products or cheese being part of their value chain.

I should also consider if there are any indirect references. For instance, sometimes narratives might hint at other products without explicitly stating them. But in this case, the focus is clearly on sweets and confectionery, not dairy-based foods like cheese.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't mention cheese production or any involvement with cow or goat milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the user's instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions Greece as the reference member state and talks about beekeepers producing "pefkothymaromelo," which is described as a traditional product made by blending pine and thyme honey. It also refers to it being a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) product, indicating it's a high-quality, region-specific honey.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese production here. The narrative focuses entirely on honey—how it's produced, processed, marketed, and its quality. There's no discussion about dairy products, milk sources, or cheese-making processes. All the primary activities revolve around beekeeping and honey processing.

Since the value chain is centered around honey rather than dairy, there's no involvement in producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return an empty JSON object.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2924 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Portugal Estrelda and the reference card ID is VC03 PT2. It talks about sheep breeds Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira feeding on pastures in the geographical area of Serra da Estrela. They can use simple or compound food to reinforce their diet under certain conditions.

Then it mentions that Serra da Estrela Cottage Cheese PDO is made from the whey of Serra da Estrela Cheese PDO (VC02 PT2). This cottage cheese can have added raw sheep's milk from those same breeds and water. It also says that sometimes, with proper authorization, Serrana goat breed milk can be used.

So, looking at this, the cheese production involves sheep's milk as the primary ingredient, but it also allows for the addition of goat's milk in some cases. There's no mention of cow's milk being used here. The focus is on sheep and goats, not cows.

Therefore, since the value chain does involve producing cheese with either sheep or goat milk, or a mix of both, I should include the ID in the JSON.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the lead product is ALMO, which stands for Almo Steirisches Almochsenfleisch. It's a label for quality ox products protected as a word mark. The focus here seems to be on meat production, specifically beef from oxen raised in traditional pastures with high animal welfare standards.

The value chain involves cooperation between farmers, veterinarians, butchers, retailers, tourism, and the regional development agency. They have their own regional slaughterhouse that works with sheep farmers, free-range pig farmers, and local butchers to enhance regional value creation. The narrative also talks about ALMO serving as a lead product for regional development and contributing to landscape preservation through pasture farming.

Nowhere in this description do they mention cheese production. Instead, the emphasis is on meat products, particularly beef, and the associated slaughterhouse operations. There's no reference to dairy processing, milk types used for cheese, or any cheese-related activities. The innovations mentioned are related to meat production, regional value creation, and landscape preservation.

So, based on this analysis, the mountain value chain in narrative 2714 is not involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. They're focused on meat products, specifically beef, rather than dairy products like cheese.

The mountain value chain described in narrative 2714 focuses on meat production, particularly beef, and does not involve cheese production.

It talks about Rakfish being a traditional product in Norway, which is fermented trout. The process involves taking fish from the water and putting them into buckets with specific renewal from natural streams. They emphasize the environment for breeding fish, mentioning factors like water temperature, speed, and biochemical characteristics affecting quality.

It also mentions social assets through PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) certifications that bring producers together. Rakfish is consumed all along Norway and has a unique traditional fermentation method in Europe. The narrative discusses challenges related to climate change, such as changes in water stream regimes, increased precipitation, decreased snow cover, and rising temperatures affecting trout populations.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative. The innovation mentioned is the use of an e-commerce platform, though they still use traditional methods for curing fish. They were the first rakfish to get a Norwegian Specialty of Food Label and one of the first fish products with PDO certification before 2003 when regulations didn't allow it.

Nowhere in this narrative does it mention cheese or milk from cows, goats, or a mix. It's all about Rakfish, which is a type of fermented trout. Cheese production isn't discussed at all. So, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow or goat milk.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions Scotland Hutton as the reference member state and refers to breakfast puddings like haggis and Stornoway black pudding. It talks about their export value, cultural significance, and the challenges faced by the value chain, such as tourism reliance and potential impacts from Brexit or COVID.

I'm looking for any mention of cheese production, specifically using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The key terms to look for are "cheese," "cow milk," "goat milk," or similar phrases related to dairy products. 

In the provided narrative, the focus is on haggis and black pudding, which are types of savory dishes, not cheese. Haggis is typically made from sheep's pluck (heart, liver, lungs), mixed with spices, oatmeal, and encased in a sheep's stomach. Black pudding is a blood sausage. Neither of these are cheeses.

The narrative also discusses the value chain's reliance on tourism, social assets like farmer/butcher relationships, and cultural aspects related to traditional production methods. However, there's no mention of cheese or dairy products beyond the context of meat-based dishes.

Additionally, the land use systems mentioned are grassland and natural land, which could be relevant for grazing animals but again, without a direct link to cheese production from cows or goats.

Since the narrative doesn't include any information about producing cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix, I conclude that this value chain isn't involved in such cheese production. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2955. The narrative mentions that Romania is the reference member state and refers to 'Pastrama de Oaie.' Now, 'Pastrama' typically means cured or smoked meat, right? In this case, it's made from boneless mutton, which comes from sheep. So, they're talking about a meat product here, specifically lamb that's been preserved and smoked with a special recipe.

The narrative also discusses the processing of requests for OQT (which I think stands for Origin Quality Tag) and mentions Mountain Development Offices checking compliance. But all this seems to be about regulating the production and labeling of mountain products, not cheese.

Cheese usually involves milk from cows, goats, or sometimes a mix. Since 'Pastrama de Oaie' is a meat product, there's no mention of any dairy involved. The focus is entirely on meat processing and preservation methods. There's nothing about cheese-making techniques, milk sources, or dairy products in the narrative.

So, putting it all together, this value chain isn't producing cheese but rather a smoked meat product. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return an empty JSON because the mountain value chain isn't involved in cheese production with cow, goat, or mixed milk.

First, let's read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain consists of a beekeeper who produces and markets honey locally and online. They also mention that the honey goes through certification. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, but the type of innovation isn't specified. Additionally, the producer offers a new service by allowing consumers to sponsor beehives, which helps raise awareness about bees and provides extra income.

Now, looking at the key points: the main product here is honey, produced by a beekeeper. There's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the narrative. The activities revolve around honey production, marketing, certification, and the innovative service of beehive sponsorship. 

Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. Since the narrative doesn't discuss any dairy products or mention cheese at all, it's safe to conclude that this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese. The focus is entirely on honey and related services.

It does say it's involved in dairy productions but doesn't specify the type of milk. High-quality traditional dairy products could be made from various sources, but without explicit information, I can't assume.

I should also consider if there are any indirect hints. The mention of breeders might imply they have herds, possibly cows or goats, but again, it's not specified.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Switzerland and the reference card ID is VC 15 CH1. The brand Soglio is known for cosmetics from Grisons, refining natural alpine raw materials into body care products. They sell these products in high quality but aren't overly sustainable or local. There's a question about whether this could be improved.

The value chain is classified as Traditional and Innovative, with the innovation related to new marketing strategies. The land use systems are N/A, and local assets include natural and cultural aspects.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production. The narrative talks about cosmetics made from herbs and other natural finds. There's no indication that they produce cheese or involve milk from cows, goats, or a mix. It's all about body care products, not dairy products like cheese.

So, since there's no information about cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk in this narrative, the value chain isn't involved in such activities.
</think>

The mountain value chain described does not involve producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. It focuses on cosmetics rather than dairy products.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty one.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions Styria beef as a premium product from organic farmers in Styria, Austria. The main actors are BIO-BEEF GmbH and 'Karnerta', focusing on marketing to retailers, restaurants, and wholesalers. There's also mention of a butcher shop called 'Marcher' and Bio Austria association for certification.

Looking at the products, it's all about beef—Styria beef is their main product. The narrative doesn't talk about cheese production anywhere. It focuses on meat, specifically beef, from organic farmers. Even though there are mentions of other actors like 'Karnerta' and 'Marcher', they're involved in marketing and distribution of beef, not dairy products.

The mountain regions described are part of the reference chain RR 11, Austrian Alps, but again, this is about the landscape where the beef is produced. There's no indication that cheese is made from cow or goat milk here. The narrative doesn't mention any dairy processing or cheese-making facilities.

So, putting it all together, since the value chain is centered around beef production and distribution, not cheese, I shouldn't include an ID in the JSON. Instead, I'll return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The value chain has open space for innovation but today it behaves basically as a traditional chain except for the compliance of a small group of producers with the regulations associated with the organic production system. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Similar characteristics occur in many other mountain ranges in Southern Europe where olive oil is produced. However, with some exceptions, a specific value chain has not been articulated that would gain in scale while connecting organic production with innovative and integrated regenerative practices with the conservation of mountain ecosystems and landscapes.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the Moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference Card ID is VC 13 ES. The focus here is on organic production of olive oil in mountain areas. They talk about a small group of producers targeting a niche market, emphasizing innovative systems, coordination among producers, processing chains, specific products under organic certification, local olive varieties, marketing channels, synergies with other sectors like culture and tourism, adaptation to climate change, technical improvements, and regenerative agriculture.

The narrative classifies the VC as both Traditional and Innovative, with exogenous innovation related to new processes. It mentions land use systems as Cropland and local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects. They also note similarities in other Southern European mountain ranges but point out that a specific value chain hasn't been fully articulated yet.

Now, the key here is whether cheese production is mentioned. The entire narrative revolves around olive oil production. There's no mention of dairy products, milk types, or cheese at all. Olive oil is clearly the main product discussed, from production to processing and marketing.

Since the query specifically asks about cheese made with cow, goat, or mixed milk, and there's nothing in the narrative pointing towards any dairy products, I can confidently say that this value chain isn't involved in cheese production. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Hungary and the VC ID is VC04 HU. It talks about a social employment program initiated by the local government involving poor, unemployed people, including Roma communities. They produce pumpkin seeds and process them into different products. 

It mentions that the primary sector share of employment in the region is 3.89%, secondary is 40.14%, and tertiary is 55.97%. Then it goes on to say that peeled seedless pumpkins are grown, processed using high-tech solar drying equipment, and packaged for sale through short food chains. The products are traditional but well-designed for wealthy customers, using solar energy and social networks/ICT for marketing.

The value chain uses natural resources like pumpkin plantations for oil production and herbs. They emphasize cooperation within the village, local authority support, and human resources as key factors. They're part of a territorial quality assurance system. Challenges include climate issues like droughts.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese or dairy products made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. The narrative doesn't talk about cheese at all. It's focused on pumpkin seeds, pumpkins, and herbs. They process these into oil and other products but there's no indication they make cheese.

The set of activities of the cooperative contribute to the local SES. The raw materials and products used by the cooperative are provided mainly by the local natural resources, the grassland and natural land. The women's cooperative has an important impact for the area of Gergeri, as well as for every mountainous area in Crete, because it is a success story for the female and montainous entrepreneurship, adapted to the environment and the tradition. Most of their products have a reference to the Cretan cuisine and heritage. The women of the Cretan highlands have limited and difficult access to occupations other than farming activities in family level, which makes them completely dependent and deprives them of the prospect of personal and occupational choices. The majority of young women of the mountainous areas look for ways to leave their home villages, exacerbating the decline of the local population.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain in narrative 2809 produces cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the provided content carefully.

The narrative mentions that the cooperative is based in Greece, specifically in Gergeri, Crete. It talks about their products being under quality standards and sold online. They use local natural resources like grassland and natural land for their raw materials. The products are related to Cretan cuisine and heritage.

Now, looking for clues about cheese production: the narrative doesn't explicitly mention cheese or milk types. It does say they produce high-quality products linked to local raw materials but doesn't specify whether these include cow, goat, or a mix. They have a tavern for social events, which might serve dairy products, but again, no specifics on cheese.

Since there's no direct information about the type of milk used in their cheese production, I can't confirm if they're involved with cow, goat, or mixed milk cheeses. Therefore, based solely on the given content, it seems the value chain isn't specifically identified as producing such cheeses.

If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions Scotland Hutton as the moving reference member state and refers to VC 15 UK. It talks about heather being used for honey and jewelry making. Specifically, it says that Scottish heather is used in honey production and also in jewelry, using the woody stems of heather.

Next, I need to identify if there's any mention of cheese production, especially involving cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Scanning through the text, I don't see any references to cheese at all. The focus is on heather's use in honey and jewelry. There's also a note about land use systems being natural and local assets including natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Additionally, the narrative discusses innovation in marketing strategies for heather jewelry, mentioning online stores like Etsy. It compares this to pressed flower jewelry but doesn't mention cheese or dairy products anywhere.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is France CCVD and the value chain (VC) has a specific card ID. It talks about organic still wine production in the Drôme region. They developed this VC as a response to the decline in Clairette de Die, which is a local sparkling wine. Producers shifted from making Clairette de Die to still wines using old vineyards and local grape varieties.

The narrative emphasizes organic or biodynamic practices and mentions certifications like Vigneron Independant, Biodynamic, and Agriculture Biologique. It also discusses the Drome Valley as the reference mountain chain and describes the region's diverse agricultural resources, noting that the north-east has middle and high mountains with agriculture focused on livestock and small gardening, while the south is more Mediterranean.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative is entirely about wine production—organic still wines—and doesn't mention anything related to dairy products like cheese. It talks about vineyards, grapes, and winemaking processes but nothing about milking animals or cheesemaking.

If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the value chain includes local pickers, purchasing stations, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and end consumers like markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and health shops. The narrative also notes that most producers adhere to quality schemes such as HACCP but doesn't specify what they produce.

Looking for clues about cheese production, I see references to the mountain's climate, forests, herbs, and its use for recreation. It was proclaimed a national park due to these features. However, there's no explicit mention of dairy products or cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. The narrative focuses more on the geographical and climatic aspects rather than the specific agricultural products.

I should consider if there's any implicit information suggesting cheese production. Since it's a mountainous region, it's common for such areas to have dairy farming. But without direct statements about cheese production, I can't assume that. The mention of processors could relate to various types of processing, not necessarily dairy.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no evidence that this value chain produces the specified cheeses. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Buckwheat is produced by individual farmers, mostly farmers who also started to grow other old types of grains (spelt, barley, etc.). It is grown almost without herbicides and 
populairity of the product creates much larger demand, and therefore wider growingof this grain. Growing conditions are favorable, but also in some years, if the temperature is too high in the flowering season, yields are very small / brining insecurity in the market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Buckwheat was grown in the area of Nova Varos for a very long time, but it was abandoned after the II World War, as it was considered as 'food for poor'. New tendencies and re-introduction of old grains as healthy food in the diet grown without pesticides, made this grain popular again Buckwheat flower is produced in the old mills (stone mills) and the shelves are sold for pillows and other products. No part of buckwheat is wasted. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and Habitat of endangered species.   Buckwheat is produced in other mountain areas in Serbia, as well as in plains (Vojvodina). NUTS3 Raska region (RS217) and Pirot district (RS226) are also regions where buckwheat is produced and can be compared B29.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to return the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the moving reference member state is Serbia, with the VC 05 SER as the reference card. The focus here is on buckwheat production by individual farmers who also grow other grains like spelt and barley. They use minimal herbicides, and the product's popularity has increased demand.

The narrative talks about challenges related to high temperatures affecting yields and market security. It classifies the VC as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovations. The innovation involves new products, processes, and marketing strategies. Land use includes cropland, grassland, forestry, and natural land. Local assets are natural, social, cultural, and habitat for endangered species.

Buckwheat is produced in mountain areas and plains like Vojvodina. Specific regions mentioned are Raska (RS217) and Pirot district (RS226). 

Now, looking for any mention of cheese or milk production. The narrative doesn't talk about dairy products at all. It's entirely focused on buckwheat—its production, challenges, innovations, and regions involved. There's no indication that the value chain is processing milk into cheese or anything related to dairy.

So, since there's no information about cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3004 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that Serbia is the reference member state for this Value Chain (VC). The VC includes various players like local pickers, purchasing stations, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and end consumers such as markets, supermarkets, restaurants, health shops. 

It then talks about the primary, secondary, and tertiary sector shares of employment in the region. These numbers don't directly relate to cheese production but rather the economic sectors involved.

The main focus seems to be on wild mushroom picking in Serbia. It mentions several types of mushrooms like boletus, chanterelle, black trumpet, milk cup, scotch bonnet, and black summer truffle. The narrative highlights that mushroom yields have increased, especially for chanterelles, with a 65% annual growth in trade. It also compares the picked amounts to Poland and notes that production is limited by environmental factors despite permit volumes.

The end consumers are listed as markets, supermarkets, health shops, restaurants, and pharmacies. The narrative ends by stating this is an underutilized VC with potential for growth through new marketing strategies targeting niche markets interested in nature and health.

Nowhere in the narrative does it mention cheese or milk types like cow, goat, or a mix. It's all about mushrooms and their trade. So, the mountain value chain here isn't involved in cheese production but rather in wild mushroom harvesting and processing.
</think>

The mountain value chain described in narrative 3004 is focused on wild mushroom picking and trade, not cheese production.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2771 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, let's read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is the Czech Republic, and the reference card ID is VC 16 CZ. It describes a family or unmarried couple who produce an exclusive alcoholic drink of fruit wine type. They use rosehips, which are traditionally processed for tea. The wine is related to new products, and the land use systems involved include rosehip bushes. Local assets mentioned are natural and cultural.

Additionally, the company produces typical fruit wines using black currants and strawberries, but these fruits aren't local—they're purchased from Czechia and Slovakia.

Now, I need to analyze whether this value chain is producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. From the narrative, the focus seems to be on fruit wines, specifically those made from rosehips, black currants, and strawberries. There's no mention of dairy products like cheese at all. The production involves alcoholic beverages, not cheeses.

Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or other animals, but in this case, the narrative doesn't reference any dairy processing. Instead, it's centered around fruit wines, which are made from fruits, not milk. Therefore, there's no indication that the value chain is involved in cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk.

So, based on the information provided, the mountain value chain described isn't producing the specified types of cheese. As a result, I should output an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If so, I need to output the JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions Italy Vinidea as the reference member state and talks about the Ofena basin area. The main points are about viticulture—wine production—and how climate change has affected it. They mention a revival of the value chain, improved grape production conditions, investments from wine brands, and an increase in tourism.

Then, towards the end, there's a list of typical products: safron (di Navelli) and cheese called Canestrato di Castel del Monte. So, the narrative explicitly mentions this specific cheese.

Now, I need to figure out what kind of milk is used for Canestrato di Castel del Monte. From my general knowledge, Canestrato is an Italian cheese, typically from Puglia. It's usually made from cow's milk, but sometimes a mix with sheep or goat might be possible. However, the narrative doesn't specify the type of milk used.

Since the user's instruction is to check if the value chain produces cheese using cow, goat, or a mix, and given that Canestrato is mentioned without specifying the milk source, I can infer it's likely made with cow's milk as that's traditional. Therefore, the value chain is involved in producing such cheese.

So, the JSON should include the ID of the narrative, which is 2894.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Italy with UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference card ID is VC 07 IT. Then it talks about MP Sardinia's core business being potato production, specifically early potatoes sold on the market before other varieties. They also produce 'cioccoderra' cookies during Christmas and Easter to increase their product range.

The cookies are made using two types of potatoes: purple and yellow. The description goes into how each potato variety contributes to the dough texture and flavor. It mentions that they combine these with cocoa, butter, sugar, and no preservatives. 

Nowhere in this narrative is there any mention of cheese production. The focus is entirely on potato products—specifically early potatoes and a speciality cookie. There's no indication that milk from cows or goats is used in their products. The cookies are made using potato cream, not dairy-based ingredients.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is VC08 AT. It talks about the Murauer brewery being engaged in sustainability efforts and promoting regionality. They produce something called "Murelli," which seems to be a monade production, available on tap initially but now in bottles. The price is low, comparable to Coca-Cola or supermarket lemonades.

It also mentions that Murauer is an old beer brand using traditional brewing art for marketing. They focus on regional sourcing and sustainability, which makes them important in their peripheral region. Their water source is a key asset for product quality. Challenges include competition from other breweries, especially those part of larger unions, and maintaining water quality for sustainability.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovations. Their sustainability efforts and regional sourcing are highlighted as innovative.

Now, the question is about cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk. The narrative doesn't mention anything related to cheese. It's all about a brewery producing beer and monades. There's no indication of dairy products, cheese, or any involvement with milk sources. The focus is on brewing, water quality, sustainability in production, and regional ingredients for their beers.

So, since the value chain is centered around brewing and not dairy or cheese production, it doesn't involve producing cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3043. Let me go through each part of the narrative to see if there's any mention of cheese or milk types used in production.

The narrative starts by mentioning Slovakia as the reference member state and talks about activities like collecting juniper berries, preparing drinks, and marketing. Key actors include forest owners, drink producers, and consumers. The positive impact is on the local SES, with employment shares across sectors given, but that doesn't directly relate to cheese production.

Next, it lists three trademarks registered as protected geographical products: Špišská Borovička, Slovenská Borovička Juniperus, and Liptovská Borovička. These are described as beverages made by fermenting juniper fruits. The process involves distillation with neutral alcohol and water, and the recipe is a closely guarded secret. It's noted as a traditional spirit drink in Slovakia.

The natural assets mentioned are forests and meadows for juniper and cropland for cereals used in the spirit. Cultural assets relate to traditional products and the recipe knowledge. Challenges include imitation using artificial aroma and importing juniper berries from other countries, but these still don't mention cheese.

Looking through all this information, there's no reference to cheese production at all. The focus is entirely on a distilled beverage made from juniper berries. There's nothing about milk sources or cheese-making processes. Therefore, the mountain value chain in question isn't involved in producing cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk.

Such activities have been proven sustainable and result to the strengthening of the social network and the resilience of the mountain populations. Αdaptable to the drier Mediterranean climate, the carob tree can form the basis of an agroforestry system.

The Bran area offers a significant number of attractions for tourists, but the pattern of development during the last 30 years has come to threaten its future viability and sustainability as an attractive and profitable tourist destination. Bran is very well located and easily accessible with relatively good infrastructure. It has developed as a multi-purpose recreational resource with some relatively good accomodation / restaurants combined with a proliferation of rustic-styled 'agro-touristic' farms and second homes (the majority of which are newly constructed). Consequently the traditional rural identity of the area has become lost to an 'urban-type' over-development which increasingly discourages foriegn visitors whilst still appealing to the domestic visitor.

If so, I need to output the JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID is 2817, and the content mentions that the reference member state is Greece, specifically Crete. It talks about Dittany growing on the mountains of Crete, used in perfumes, cosmetics, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals. These products are produced in Italy and other European countries, but the narrative doesn't mention anything about cheese production.

I'm looking for keywords related to cheese, milk types, or dairy products. The narrative discusses herbs and their uses in various industries but doesn't touch on cheese at all. There's no mention of cows, goats, or any dairy processing involved in the value chain described.

Since there's no information indicating that this mountain value chain is producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain with ID 3013. My task is to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON object containing the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 07 SCA. It talks about barley being suitable for mountain areas like Roros because it grows quickly and doesn't require fertilizers or pesticides. There are four challenges listed related to barley's production and market issues.

The value chain is classified as both Traditional and Innovative, with exogenous innovation linked to the Rorosmat brand. The innovation involves new marketing strategies through their e-commerce platform and website. The land use system mentioned is Cropland, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

Now, I need to check if any part of this narrative refers to cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Scanning through the text, there's no mention of dairy products, cheese, cows, goats, or any related terms. The focus is entirely on barley production and marketing strategies for regional products.

Since there's no indication that the value chain produces cheese from the specified milks, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 3044 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Slovakia and the key activities are packaging and marketing. The key actors are producers and those involved in marketing. It talks about labeling mineral water as 'mineral water' based on the amount of minerals it contains. 

Looking further, there's a mention of the tertiary sector share being 59%, which relates to services like marketing. Slovakia has several mineral water springs in the mountains that are commercialized for drinking water. There are 14 brands of mineral waters and numerous spring waters, some of which have been around for decades. These waters are popular not just domestically but also in the Czech Republic. Recently, they've started adding local herbs with bio quality, and new processes involve combining mountain water with wild herbs. The marketing strategies focus on modifying products through packaging varieties, flavor, and CO2 content.

The narrative lists some local water springs and wild herbs used for flavoring: Raspberry, Blackthorn, Red currant, Gooseberry, Rosehip, Elderberry flower, Dandelion, Chamomile. 

Then it outlines the challenges: a competitive market with many brands and modifications, weak promotion of Slovak waters, and environmental issues related to non-recyclable plastic packaging.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain is involved in cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk. The narrative doesn't mention anything about dairy products, cheese, cows, goats, or any milk-based manufacturing. It's entirely focused on mineral water and spring water, their branding, marketing strategies, and the use of herbs for flavoring. There's no indication that they're producing cheese or any dairy-related products.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't involve cheese production with cow, goat, or mixed milk, the correct response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain in Italy, specifically involving forests and wood products. The task is to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the value chain involves forests certified by PEFC, which produce timber and wood used by sawmills. These materials are then used for construction pieces, frames, furniture, etc. There's also mention of byproducts like sawdust being used in biomass plants for energy.

Nowhere in this narrative is there any reference to dairy products, cheese production, or anything related to milk from cows, goats, or a mix. The focus seems entirely on forestry and woodworking industries. Even the cooperative mentioned (legnoservizi.it) appears to be related to wood services rather than dairy.

Given that the query specifically asks about cheese made with cow, goat, or mixed milk, and since there's no mention of such activities in the provided text, I can confidently conclude that this value chain isn't involved in cheese production. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 2888 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, let's read the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the value chain pertains to organic production of champenois wines by Ferrari company, historically based in Trento. They process grapes from their own farms and are looking into expanding vineyard cultivation in marginal areas.

Now, I need to identify if cheese production is part of this value chain. The key here is to look for any mention related to dairy products like cheese. The narrative talks about wine production, specifically champenois wines, which are sparkling wines. There's no indication that they're involved in making cheese or using milk from cows or goats.

Cheese production typically involves milk from animals like cows, goats, or sheep. Since the narrative focuses on grapes and wine, it doesn't touch upon dairy at all. Therefore, there's no involvement with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix for cheese production.

So, based on this analysis, the value chain isn't involved in producing the specified cheeses. The appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production, specifically using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative discusses challenges faced by small-scale chicken farms regarding profitability and animal welfare. It also notes that these farms play a role in local food production but doesn't link this to cheese-making.

I notice that the value chain is described as traditional because it uses established farm practices. However, there's no mention of dairy products or cheese at all. The focus seems entirely on chicken husbandry and meat production. Even though it mentions the challenges and the shift towards local food, it doesn't tie this to cheese made from cow or goat milk.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2915. Let me go through each part:

- It mentions that the reference member state is NMK, which I think stands for North Macedonia.
- The value chain (VC) has a reference card ID of VC 18 NMK.
- The top 15 wineries are members of Wines of Macedonia, working together to represent their wines and regions in expert markets. They also participate in creating wine laws and appellations with the Ministry of Agriculture.

So far, I'm noticing that this is about a wine value chain. Wineries and wine production are the focus here. There's no mention of cheese at all. The narrative talks about improving wine quality, participating in markets, and legal aspects related to wine.

Next, it discusses the mountain chain called Maleshevija. It provides geographical details like location, municipalities, rivers, forests, pastures, size, population stats, income levels, and GVA (Gross Value Added). All these are about the region's characteristics but don't directly relate to cheese production.

I'm looking for any clues that indicate dairy or cheese production. The narrative doesn't mention cows, goats, milk processing, cheese-making facilities, or any products related to dairy. It's all about wine—wineries, wine regions, wine laws, and economic data tied to the wine industry.

Since there's no information about cheese, whether it's made from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I can conclude that this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing such cheeses. The focus is solely on wine production.

Therefore, according to the instructions, if the value chain isn't involved in cheese production as specified, I should return an empty JSON object.

Normally, they use local malt for the breweries and no hops. Instead they add juniper seeds to the water to give flavours from local forests.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3118. Let me parse the content:

- The moving reference member state is Switzerland.
- The reference card ID is VC 21 CH1.
- It mentions a young whiskey brand distilled at a high altitude in Grisons.
- The mountain chain and landscape references are unspecified or incomplete.
- The value chain's origin is exogenous, meaning it comes from outside the region.
- The idea was to bring whiskey making to Switzerland using Swiss features for marketing.
- Innovations relate to new products and processes.
- Land use systems involved: Cropland.
- Local assets include natural and cultural elements.

Now, I need to check if this value chain is producing cheese. Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. But looking at the narrative, it's about whiskey, not dairy products. The focus is on distilling alcohol, specifically whiskey, which doesn't involve milk processing.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of dairy. The narrative talks about using Swiss features for marketing but doesn't specify anything related to cheese or milk. The innovations are in new products and processes, which again points towards the whiskey production rather than dairy-based products.

Since there's no indication that this value chain is involved in cheese production, whether from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2973 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Scotland Hutton and the reference card ID is VC 14 UK. It talks about Highland cattle being symbolic of Scotland, kept for their cultural value and good genetics. They produce leaner meat and more calves than other breeds. Also, their milk has a high butterfat content, so they're often kept as house cows.

Highland cows are used to manage grass growth to encourage wildflowers and butterflies. They’re suited to the cold climate and can survive in mountainous terrain. The narrative mentions that in multiple Lochaber villages, these cattle roam freely, highlighting their importance but also potential conflicts.

The reference mountain chain is Highlands and Islands (RR9) and (NUTS2), with the reference landscape being Lochaber. It's a region known for tourism and outdoor recreation, with Fort William as the largest town. The area size is 4654.827692 km², with low population density in rural parts.

Now, I need to determine if cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix is part of this value chain. The narrative mentions Highland cattle and their milk's high butterfat content, which suggests that their milk could be used for dairy products like cheese. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that cheese is being produced. It focuses more on the cultural and environmental aspects rather than agricultural production specifics.

Since there's no direct mention of cheese production or the types of milk used in such processes, I can't confirm that the value chain is involved in producing cheese with cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3020 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. Let me read through the narrative carefully.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 14 SCA. Then it talks about Jønsi Gård on Hjuksebø in Telemark, Norway's largest producer of biodynamic apples since 1991. They're Demeter certified, which I know has to do with organic and biodynamic farming.

The narrative goes into some statistics about employment sectors in the province and region—primary, secondary, tertiary shares. It mentions that their juices are high quality and care for the environment, noting that despite a short growing season, the climate is good for apple production. Social assets are tied to sustainability and circular systems. The main challenge is increasing customers for organic products, classified as Current type.

The VC is Traditional, with unspecified innovation related to the whole chain. Land use is cropland, and local assets include natural and social aspects. There's another case in Møre og Romsdal.

Now, looking for any mention of cheese or milk production. The narrative focuses on apple production and organic juices. There's no indication that they produce cheese or involve cow or goat milk anywhere. It's all about apples and juice, so the value chain isn't involved in dairy products like cheese.

The mountain value chain described in narrative 3020 is focused on biodynamic apple production and organic juice manufacturing. There is no mention of cheese production involving cow milk, goat milk, or a mix thereof.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 3093. The narrative mentions that the value chain's reference member state is Spain UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 43 ES. It talks about sweets produced in small bakeries along municipalities of Sierra Morena. They use certified products like PDO or organic olive oil, nuts, honey, herbs, liquors, wine, and pig fat.

Now, I'm looking for any mention of cheese production. The narrative discusses traditional ingredients but focuses on sweets and baked goods. There's no specific reference to cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk. It does talk about dairy products like honey and wine, but those are used as ingredients in the sweets, not as cheeses themselves.

I should also consider if there's any indirect mention of cheese production. The value chain involves traditional ingredients, which might include dairy, but without explicit information about cheese, I can't assume it's part of their product line. The focus seems to be on baked goods and possibly olive oil-based products rather than dairy cheeses.

Therefore, based solely on the provided content, there's no indication that this mountain value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. So, the appropriate response is an empty JSON.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2898. Let me go through each sentence to see if there's any mention of cheese production.

The narrative starts by talking about the reference member state being NMK and the VC 01 NMK as the card ID. It mentions that there isn't a consolidated value chain for this product, which might be relevant but doesn't directly talk about cheese yet.

Next, it refers to the mountain chain as Mountain Meleshevija and describes the production environment as very clean. The products are noted to have rare values. Now, here's where I need to pay attention: the narrative specifically mentions the production of Juniper essential oil. It talks about how variable this production is due to climate change and issues with chemicals being used sometimes wrongly or unnecessarily.

It also states that there isn't a consolidated value chain for this product, which again points towards Juniper essential oil rather than cheese. The challenges faced are both current and predicted, and the VC is classified as Traditional. There's no mention of innovation in the VC itself, but it does say that Juniper essential oil is used in different final innovative products.

The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land, with local assets including Social and cultural aspects. However, none of these points relate to cheese production. The focus seems entirely on Juniper essential oil, which is a plant-based product, not dairy-based like cheese.

So, putting it all together: the narrative doesn't mention anything about cows, goats, or cheese production. It's centered around essential oils from Juniper berries, which are used in various innovative products but aren't related to dairy. Therefore, this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix.

I should make sure I'm not missing any indirect references. Sometimes narratives might hint at other products tangentially, but here it's pretty straightforward. The key product is Juniper essential oil, and there's no mention of dairy processing or cheese-making activities.

Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object since the value chain isn't involved in producing the specified types of cheese.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2796 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully to extract relevant information. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is France INRAE and the reference card ID is VC 10 FR. It talks about the essential oil of helichrysum from Corsica, its reputation, high price, and connection to wild nature. It also discusses production value being low relative to activities like distillation, trading, and prescription of oils.

The narrative then touches on downstream power risks affecting wild harvests and the environment. There's a mention of GI certification for the oil not succeeding except for some AB oils, which I assume refers to Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) or similar designations in France. It also notes that industrial brands like cosmetics, perfumery, and aromatherapy don't guarantee collective protection.

Next, the reference mountain chain is Corsican mountains, with the reference landscape being Corsica itself. The value chain covers all of Corsica due to homogeneous resources, disease impacts, driving skills, plant varieties, and labels. The area size is 8722 km², with altitudes ranging from 0 to 2706 meters. Population details are provided but might not be directly relevant here.

Now, focusing on the key points: the narrative discusses essential oils, specifically helichrysum oil, and its production chain. There's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the text. The value chain revolves around the extraction and trade of this essential oil, which is used in cosmetics, perfumery, and aromatherapy.

Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. Since the narrative doesn't discuss any dairy products, processing of milk, cheese-making techniques, or related industries, it's safe to conclude that the mountain value chain here isn't involved in cheese production.

Therefore, based on the content provided, the value chain is not producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The answer should be an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative ID 2929 is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is Portugal Estrelda and the reference card ID is VC 08 PT2. It talks about Heather Honey being collected from hives in the Serra da Estrela highlands, which is sold locally and nationally. 

Looking further, there's a lot of data about per capita income, GVA (Gross Value Added) across different sectors like primary, secondary, and tertiary. There are numbers for bed places in tourist accommodations, agricultural holdings, nearest settlements, and mentions of protected areas. Additionally, employment sector shares are provided for both the province and region.

The narrative also notes that Heather is a characteristic bush of the highlands, which ties back to the honey production mentioned earlier. 

Now, I need to see if any part of this relates to cheese production. The key here is whether the value chain involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. Cheese production typically requires milk as a primary ingredient. However, in the narrative provided, there's no mention of dairy products, cheese, cows, goats, or any related terms. Instead, it focuses on honey production and other economic sectors like tourism and agriculture.

The data points about GVA for the primary sector being around 3-4% suggest that while agriculture is present, it's not a dominant part of the economy in this region. The emphasis seems to be more on the tertiary sector (services) given its higher share in employment and GVA.

Since there's no information indicating that cheese or dairy products are part of this value chain, I can conclude that the mountain value chain described here isn't involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

If it is, I need to output a JSON with the narrative's ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The narrative starts by mentioning that the moving reference member state is Spain ADEGUA and the reference card ID is VC 16 ES. It talks about springs discovered in the late 18th century and declared mineral-medicinal water in 1818. There's a focus on protecting these springs from human, industrial, and livestock activities to maintain water quality.

The narrative then discusses the company's commitment to environmental sustainability, reducing industrial impact, using sustainable materials, and packaging. It mentions that the VC is classified as both traditional and innovative, with endogenous and exogenous innovation. The innovations are in new products, processes, marketing strategies, and governance systems. The land use system is natural spring water, and local assets include natural, social, and cultural aspects.

It also notes that many mountainous regions commercialize mineral waters, specifically mentioning Spain's example with Lanjarón mineral water.

Now, I need to determine if this value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Cheese production typically involves milk from cows, goats, sheep, etc., but the narrative here is centered around mineral water springs and their protection. The focus seems to be on bottling and distributing mineral water rather than dairy products.

Looking for keywords related to cheese: terms like "cheese," "dairy," "milk processing" aren't present. Instead, it's about water sources, sustainability in packaging, and business strategies around mineral water. There's no mention of any dairy-related activities or products.

Therefore, since the narrative doesn't indicate that the value chain is involved in cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. If it is, I need to return a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3060. Let me go through each part of the narrative to see if there's any mention of cheese or milk types.

The narrative starts by mentioning Spain as the reference member state and a specific PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) called Botillo del Bierzo. It talks about companies associated with this PGI, which are meat companies manufacturing botillo, chorizo, salchichón, and other similar products. The ingredients listed include pork parts like tongue, cheek, shoulder, and backbone, along with additives like salt, paprika, garlic, and spices.

I'm noticing that the focus is on meat products—botillo, chorizo, etc.—which are all types of sausages or cured meats. There's no mention of cheese production anywhere in the narrative. The companies involved are meat manufacturers, not dairy or cheese producers. 

The narrative also discusses regulations and certifications related to production processes and mentions marketing strategies but again, nothing about cheese. It does talk about local assets like cultural aspects but doesn't tie that into cheese-making.

Since cheese requires milk from cows, goats, or a mix, and there's no indication here of any dairy products being made, I can confidently say this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese. Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty JSON object.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain in Serbia, specifically focusing on the Arilje raspberry region. My task is to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that Serbia is the biggest producer and exporter of frozen raspberries, with Arilje being known for its high-quality raspberries. The region uses methods like handpicking and special treatments to maintain quality. They freeze the raspberries immediately after harvesting to preserve freshness, and they also produce fresh and dried products.

Now, I need to check if there's any mention of cheese production in this narrative. Cheese typically involves milk from cows, goats, or a mix. However, the entire narrative is centered around raspberries—how they're grown, processed, exported, and their market value. There's no indication that the value chain here deals with dairy products or cheese at all.

I should also consider if there are any indirect references. For example, sometimes narratives might mention by-products or other related industries, but in this case, it's strictly about raspberries. The focus is on frozen and fresh raspberry production, not dairy-based products like cheese.

Since the narrative doesn't touch upon cheese production using cow, goat, or mixed milk, I can confidently conclude that the mountain value chain described isn't involved in such activities. Therefore, the appropriate response would be an empty JSON object as specified.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants me to determine if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. The ID here is 3012. The narrative mentions that the moving reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO, and the reference card ID is VC 06 SCA. It talks about hectares of organic wheat, spelt, oats, and other spring cereals in Norway. There's a mention of competition with industrial products like sweets, cereals, and snacks.

The value chain is focused on keeping the nutritional values of cereals by making granola. They started this because there was a lack of organic Norwegian granola in the market. The product is sold both in stores and online through e-commerce. The innovation types are endogenous and exogenous, related to new products and marketing strategies.

Now, I need to check if any part of this narrative involves cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. Cheese production typically involves dairy animals like cows or goats. However, the narrative here is about cereals—wheat, spelt, oats—and granola production. Granola is a cereal-based product, not a dairy product.

There's no mention of milk, cheese, or any dairy-related activities in the narrative. The focus is entirely on grains and their processing into granola. Therefore, this value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made from cow, goat, or mixed milk.

So, since there's no indication of cheese production, I should return an empty JSON as per the user's instructions.

C.   The production of pumpkin seed oil enriches the local culinary landscape.    As already addressed above, farmers are not allowed to market the oil by using the PGI label. The fact that pumpkin seed oil from the Murtal is not officially a 'Styrian pumpkin seed oil' is due to that only products from certain regions are intended for this label. The growing areas of the pumpkins must correspond to defined political districts. A bit ridiculous in this context ist, that these traditional pumpkin growing areas are not only located in Styria, they can also be found in Burgenland and Lower Austria, but the area is not expandable, even if it is located in Styria. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The cultivation of pumpkins, which had not been grown in that region traditionally, was introduced by some farmers. In cooperation with a local destillery a unique schnaps with pumpkin seeds was created. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural.   Pumpkin seed oil is usually not produced in Austrian mountainous regions.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to output a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 2723. Let me go through each sentence to see what's relevant.

The narrative starts by mentioning that the reference member state is Austria and the VC ID is VC 18 AT. It talks about oil production from four family farms, selling their product on-farm, in cooperatives, and small shops. Marketing support comes from the region. So far, nothing about cheese or milk types.

Next, it says the production of pumpkin seed oil enriches the local culinary landscape. Hmm, so they're making oil, not cheese. That's a red flag because the user is asking about cheese made with cow, goat, or mixed milk.

Then, there's a mention that farmers aren't allowed to market the oil using the PGI label because only certain regions qualify. It also notes that pumpkin seed oil isn't officially called 'Styrian' even though it's grown in areas like Burgenland and Lower Austria. The challenge here is about labeling restrictions.

The VC is classified as both traditional and innovative. Innovation comes from introducing pumpkin cultivation, working with a distillery to create schnaps using the seeds. So they're making new products but not cheese. Land use systems are cropland, and local assets are natural resources.

Finally, it explicitly states that pumpkin seed oil isn't typically produced in Austrian mountainous regions. Again, no mention of cheese or dairy products.

Putting this all together, the narrative is entirely about pumpkin seed oil production, marketing challenges, and innovations related to schnaps. There's absolutely no indication that they produce any type of cheese using cow, goat, or mixed milk. Therefore, the value chain isn't involved in cheese production as per the user's query.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the mountain value chain described in narrative 3016 is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I'll output a JSON with the id; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, let's read through the narrative carefully. The narrative mentions that the reference member state is SKANDINAVIAN UCO and the reference card ID is VC 10 SCA. It talks about cattle grazing in cultivated pastures and open pastures around farms in Dagalifjell during the grazing season from May to October. In winter, the animals are kept elsewhere.

Now, focusing on the key details: The narrative explicitly mentions "cattle" grazing. Cows are a type of cattle, so this suggests that the milk used would likely be cow's milk. There's no mention of goats or any other animals in the context of dairy production here. 

The value chain is classified as Traditional, and the innovation type is unspecified but relates to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land, with local assets being Natural and social. However, none of these details indicate anything about cheese production specifically.

Since the narrative doesn't mention goats or a mix of milk types, I can infer that the cheese produced, if any, is likely from cow's milk. Therefore, the mountain value chain in this case is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

The narrative then compares this value chain to one in Switzerland. In both cases, grape producers sell their products directly to processors like winemakers. However, it notes that unlike the Swiss model where grape growers don't process the grapes themselves, Elmalı's grape growers sell a significant portion (40%) of their production to wine companies.

Now, I need to focus on whether this value chain is involved in cheese production using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't mention anything about dairy products, cows, goats, or cheese at all. It's entirely focused on grapes and winemaking. There's no indication that the value chain processes milk or produces any kind of dairy product.

So, based solely on the content provided, there's no evidence to suggest that this mountain value chain is involved in cheese production. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should output an empty JSON.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 TR. The most common marketing channels used by apple farmers are brokers, traders, exporters and fruit juice companies. The supermarket retailers are used moderately in product sale
market outlets and the high input costs. Due to the high number of diseases in apple cultivation, productivity is low. Climate change also has an effect on low productivity. Especially the negative impact of drought on apple production is mentioned. Since apple producers have problems in finding market outlets, the produced apple cannot be sold at high prices. In addition, it is emphasized that the family labour is insufficient in apple producing family farms. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   One of the value chains that includes Apple is available in Switzerland's MRL. However, apple value chain in Turkey differs from the value chain in Switzerland. The value chain in Switzerland includes the preservation and promotion of old high-stemmed apple varieties. Apple value chain in Turkey includes traditional apple cultivation.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain, specifically ID 3151, which is related to apples in Turkey. My task is to determine if this value chain is involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both.

First, I'll read through the narrative carefully. It mentions that the reference member state is Turkey and talks about apple farmers using marketing channels like brokers, traders, exporters, and fruit juice companies. The challenges include high input costs, diseases affecting productivity, climate change impacts like drought, and issues with market outlets leading to low prices. They also mention family labor being insufficient.

Now, looking for any clues related to cheese production. The narrative is all about apples—cultivation, marketing, challenges in the apple value chain. There's no mention of dairy products, milk, or cheese at all. It's focused on fruit production and processing, not livestock or dairy farming.

I need to check if there's any indirect connection. Sometimes, mountain regions might have mixed agricultural activities, but here it's clear that apples are the main focus. The value chain is about apple cultivation, preservation of old varieties, and traditional methods. There's nothing indicating involvement with cheese production, whether from cows, goats, or a mix.

So, based on the information provided, this mountain value chain isn't involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a combination. Therefore, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 SCA. There are two types of handicraft, the soft handicrafts and the hard ones. The first one consists of clothes, jewellery and baskets of woven birch branches and are tr
f regional markets and e-commerce strategies to reach more public.   This VC is highly related to reindeer herding and the nomadic Sami ancient lifestyle. Consequently, they had to craft their own tools and get the materials from nature. Most of them come from reindeer (antlers, skin and bones) and birch wood from local forests. Knowledge on how to make them has been carried through generations and the style and techniques could vary among the ethnic groups.    1) Threat on Sapmi terrritory driven by extrative industries (mining, logging, energy); 2) To maintain the knowledge and interest of Sami people in handcrafting. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The VC is innovative as it represents a novel bussiness model for the Sami community to make tools and clothes for commertial purposes. Nonetheless, the assets and means remain traditional. In addition, they are embracing online platforms to promote the VC. An example is the Jokkmokk Market that normally takes place in the locality of Jokkmokk but this year due to COVID-19 Pandemic, it may be carried out online. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The VC is present all along Sapmi area in Norway, Sweden (Jokkmokk SE2510 or Kiruna) and Finland.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a narrative about a mountain value chain and wants to know if it's involved in producing cheese made from cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both. If it is, I need to provide a JSON with the ID; otherwise, an empty JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided narrative carefully. The ID here is 3024. The narrative talks about a value chain associated with Scandinavian UCO and mentions reindeer herding by the Sami people. It discusses handicrafts like clothes, jewelry, baskets made from birch branches. These are sold at regional markets and e-commerce platforms.

The challenges mentioned include threats to Sapmi territory from extractive industries and maintaining interest in handcrafting among the Sami community. The value chain is classified as both traditional and innovative, with exogenous innovation focusing on new business models and marketing strategies, such as moving the Jokkmokk Market online due to COVID-19.

Now, I need to check if this value chain produces cheese using cow milk, goat milk, or a mix. The narrative doesn't mention anything about dairy products, cheese production, cows, goats, or any related activities. It's all about handicrafts and reindeer herding. There's no indication of dairy processing or cheese-making.

Therefore, since the value chain isn't involved in producing cheese from cow, goat, or mixed milk, I should return an empty JSON as per the instructions.
