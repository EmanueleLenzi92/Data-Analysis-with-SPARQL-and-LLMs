An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth.

It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-fermentata-din-lapte-de-oaie-horezu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Brănză Horezu' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing). Many of the communal pastures are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and traditional dairy products. With the increased purchasing power and changing preferences of Romanian consumers there has been an increase in consumption of these dairy products, but also a clear demand for more sophisticated 'gourmet / speciality' cheeses (especially in urban areas and amongst young professionals). In part this demand has been met by imported cheeses, but it has also opened a niche for Romanian speciality cheeses such as 'Brănză Horezu' which is also widely known under the brand name 'Five Continents' (http://www.five-continent-srl.ro/index.html).

The narrative describes the production of Alpine Gruyère cheese, which is made from milk. Although it does not explicitly state whether cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both is used, the context implies that the cheese production involves dairy farming typical to Switzerland, where cow milk is predominantly used for cheese like Gruyère. Therefore, the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with cow milk.

The narrative describes Pultost, a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without rennet, but it does not mention goat milk or a mix of both. Therefore, the mountain value chain is only involved in producing cheese made with cow milk. Since the task requires involvement with cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both, and since it specifically asks for recognition if all three types are involved (or at least two), this narrative does not meet that criterion.

Although it does not explicitly state whether cow milk, goat milk, or a mix of both is used, the context implies that this traditional cheese production involves dairy farming practices typical to the region, which often include using goat milk due to its prevalence in Mediterranean areas like Crete. Therefore, based on the narrative's focus on cheese production and regional practices, it can be inferred that the value chain is involved in producing cheese made with at least one of these types of milk.

The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms, and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff, poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines, low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition, lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment, and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.

rn of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    For very traditional products, like 'Sirene' cheese, that are produced by small-scale farmers the main challenge is how to 'add value' to the product in order to increase farm / household income. This is a particular problem in locations such as Chiprovtsi Municipality where a) infrastucture is poor and the opportunity to regularly visit organised farmers' markets in the main cities is very limited; b) there is a lack of commercial processing units to produce higher quality products; c) knowledge of direct marketing is limited, and; d) there is no regional brand - or 'mountain products' brand (see below).

Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses.

In the case of 'Di Iorio', innovation crosses local (i.e., nougat) and national (panettone, Easter eggs, dove bread, etc.) gastronomic culture. However, the origin of the raw materials is not always local. Although this is not in contradiction with the local tradition (since the Romans time, the SES is connected by trades with distant areas), it may pose a problem in communication strategies.

Through the cooperation between farmers and with other value chain actors (veterinaries, butchers, retailers, tourism, regional development agency) several innovations emerged. The initiative is driven by special relationships of the initiators with other value chain actors, well embedded into the regional development, tourism and local culture.

 renewal from natural streams that flow through the ponds. This generates the best environment to breed fish as they can excersice swimming in fresh and clean water. Water temperature, speed and biochemical characteristics influence the fish quality. The social asset is represented in the PDO that brings producers together. Finally, the rakfish is a traditional product consumed all along Norway and the traditional fermentation method is quite unique in Europe.    In the light of climate change, this VC may face a challenge if the natural mountain water streams change their regimes as precipitations are expected to increase while snow cover period is expected to decrease. In addition, a rise in the mean temperatures is also expected, which could threat the population of trouts as they do not have high thermal tolerance.

Because of the limited cultivation needs and the constantl demand, offers a complementary revenue and an alternative to more intensive and labor-demanding farming activities. The carob production as well as the processing for producing products like flour or syrop, can be done in a family or community level. Such activities have been proven sustainable and result to the strengthening of the social network and the resilience of the mountain populations. Αdaptable to the drier Mediterranean climate, the carob tree can form the basis of an agroforestry system. The carob contributes to recover eroded soil, survives to heavy droughts and wildfires, improves soil's fertility by fixing nitrogen and fixes 3 times more CO2 than other woody crops with 2.5 times less water. The traditional character of carob cutivation envolves local farmers and firms and strengthens their bonds.

There are up to hundreds of small producers that brew their own beer in groups of friends or family just for their own enjoyment and consumption. Knowledge on the basic steps to make this smoked beer is shared among the brewers to maintain alive the tradition, but each of them keep their own recepies' secret, giving this way a great diversity to the local beers. Normally, they use local malt for the breweries and no hops. Instead they add juniper seeds to the water to give flavours from local forests.

and, maintaining in this context the interest of charcoal makers in a complementary and economically unprofitable activity is another critical challenge, together with the need to carry out a regenerative practice of the forest and not an extractive one. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although it provides innovative nuances by linking an associative structure that brings together the charcoal producers in collaboration with the institution responsible for the Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve, this is a traditional value chain. On the other hand, Carbón de La Cumbre intends to obtain the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certificate for good practices and sustainable forest use, as the vast majority of forest areas in Gran Canaria are already recognized. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There has been an extraordinary activity of charcoal production from vegetal remains from the forest or derived from tree pruning in many other European regions. This is also the case of the traditional charcoal and picón production in Andalusia or the charcoal-making traditions in the Basque Country and Navarre.
