Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 ES. First key actor is the Aineto project for the rehabilitation of the locality. Also the municipality of Sabiñanigo (LAU 1) where the town is located, played a key role back in 1987 giving permission to the new inhabitants to settle in. The beer has two organic certifications, the European and the one from the region of Aragón. The VC is totally embedded in the social-ecological-system. The use of natural water flows and wild ingredients together with the values of the project, make of this VC an organic activity within the valley. Other actors are all the selling points that they have around Aragón (they do not sell nationwide).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Pyreenes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Sabiñanigo. The MRL is located in the Pyrenees, the main mountain range in Spain. It hosts, four mountain valleys (Aurín, Gállego, Basa y Guarga) and 82 towns, being only 54 of them inhabited. This is partly caused by the isolation of many of these settlements and the movement to bigger towns and cities with better insfrastructure, services and employment opportunities. It has great assets for nature-based and outdoor recreation tourism.   The size of the area (km2) is 586.82. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 660.

Local place-based brewery that combines two singular aspects. On one side, it is a sustainable and organic beer production that reuses the outcomes for compost and animal feed. On the other side, it is coined in an horizontal cooperative (Bebidas y Maridajes de Aineto. S. Coop.) where the first aim is to energise and revive the locality of Aineto and the rest of the Guargera valley that had been abandoned by the mid of the past century. For the beer production they only use organic inputs. In addition, they use local ingredients to innovate in the beer production, adding new tastes and aromas that come straight from the valley (red cabbage or elderberry). As mentioned before, the brewery has a horizonal cooperative and is placed in a revitalized town and is integrated in the Aineto project that had been started by the 80's.   1) Fighting against rural depopulation by generating economic activities and employment; 2) having better infrastructure in the locality (e.g., repair and maintainance of the access road to Aineto; access to broadband internet, etc.); 3) encouraging people to visit the locality and enjoy the beer instead of having to reach further markets. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The beginning of the brewery was a challenge as it started in a depopulated town of Aineto within the municipality of Sabiñanigo with the aim of revitalizing it. The brewery is located in an old livestock building following the philosophy of the whole project which is based on using the existing buildings instead of constructing new ones. The waste from the beer production is whether composted or used to feed the livestock. Thee brewery's motto is that money should circulate 7 times in the place they live before leaving the region. The innovation is related to New products and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and social.   This project challenges the schemes of our current system by empowering the inhabitants of a locality whose desisions are taken equally. It is an example of a place-based experience that fosters social and ecological justice. Not mentioned before, the brewery creates every year the 'solidarity beer' to support social projects of the Aragón region."
