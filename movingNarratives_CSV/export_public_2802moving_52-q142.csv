Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 FR. The construction of the value of apples from the Prunelli region results from the revival of several small orchards, the voluntarism of the mayors of the localities and the commitment of the village community around the annual apple fair organized alternately in Todda and in Bastelica.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Celavu - Prunelli. The Prunelli Valley is the most important valley of Monte Renosu (2352 m). Strongly dug, it shelters few villages including those of apple production (Basterga and Todda). The strong human deprivation of the villages is compensated by a relative proximity to the city of Aiacciu. It is the old winter pastoral localities which are today the most populated, in particular because of a very strong urban and tourist attraction (Bastelicaccia and Purtichju).   The size of the area (km2) is 381.53. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 7. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2352. The total population (in thousand) is 8.7. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 22.8. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.00%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 4140. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 4140. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 0.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   The value chain begins with the revival of apple production from two villages (Todda and Bastelica) in the Prunelli region (South Corsica) by small local producers. The population of two villages took part in the project through the organization of market fairs. The revival includes the renovation of old orchards, the study of local varieties, the planting, the processing of fruits (juices and compotes) and the organization of local markets. The VC highlights a social innovation oriented towards the participation of the local populations in the reconquest of their supply.   The stake is to register the collective project which carries the VC in the duration and to give to the orchards a statute of 'common' for the benefit of the villagers. the difficulty is to invest human and financial resources (know-how and investments) and to find the legal frameworks (uses and management) which take into account the long life of an orchard. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. VC is a social innovation whose construction is the result of the revival of orchards, public support and participation of the village community. The apple fair (Todda and Bastelica) constitutes the keystone of the whole by associating the market and non-market value of the VC. Notice a collection of variety of apples in the village of Todda allows the setting up of various experiments. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are paysage villageois de montagne. The local assets include N/A.   These social innovation around feeding is also an encouraged by local mayors, officials and the implementation of public policies."
