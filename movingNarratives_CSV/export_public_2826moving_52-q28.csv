Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is HUNGARY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 HU. An emerging community of young educated environmentally conscious lifestyle migrants, co-operating with the local authority. They produce food through permaculture, contour farming, forest agriculture, extensive animal husbandry, etc. though most of it they consume within the community. They organise courses, events exhibitions in permaculture, sustainable water management, building, etc. where they charge participants for the knowledge and the food too (made of their own products). They are creating an online knowledge platform for sharing environmental- and community friendly technology (both innovative and traditional).

The community produces food through permaculture, contour farming, forest agriculture, extensive animal husbandry, etc. They organise courses, events exhibitions in permaculture, sustainable water management, building, etc. They are creating an online knowledge platform for sharing environmental- and community friendly technology . It is relevant for land use, saving and creating environmental and community values, it is an excellent example of how a conscious and powerful community can create and spread knowledge about resilience and sustainability. They represent important socio-economic trend, spreading fast in developed countries, trying to find links between innovation and tradition.   Untouched clean natural environment, beautiful landscape, expert knowledge on sustainable farming, water management, building and everyday life practices; developed local, national and international social networks.    Climate change (warming, new pests, extreme weather conditions). Civilisation/urbanisation pressure on the Mountain landscape. Turning knowledge on sustainability into income. Finding a balance between commercial and volunteer actions. Social distancing for COVID cancelled events. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The VC is innovative, because it transforms known old knowledge into modern technologies that are easy to use today. VC is both endogenous and exogenous because it is done by inmigrants, moved to the area from outside, but is based entirely on local conditions. The innovation is related to New processes, New governance systems and knowldge economy. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
