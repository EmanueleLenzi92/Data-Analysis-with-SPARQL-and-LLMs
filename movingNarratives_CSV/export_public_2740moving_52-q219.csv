Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 BG. Kilim production is also clearly linked to the traditional farming systems practised in the region sheep grazing in the mountainous pastures, the processing of their wool to produce the carpets and the collection of local herbs, flowers and minerals to colour the wool. Almost every household in the town contains a vertical handloom which the local women use to make the kilims, whilst men of the town typically engage in wool production, processing and the dyeing of the wool yarn.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Chiprovtsi Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes. Chiprovtsi is a small municipality close to the Bulgarian border with Serbia. The altitude is around 500 metres and the region is dominated by small-scale mixed farming (subsistence and semi-subsistence). The main land use is extensively grazed pastures and meadows (many of which are public) with some plots of cultivated arable land and many traditional orchards.   The size of the area (km2) is 286.9. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 3.139. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 10.94. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 39.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.19%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 4600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 524. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 13.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3402. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1497. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 18.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 19010. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 27.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.50%.   Chiprovitsi kilims are handmade flat tapestry woven carpets / rugs. Their production is closely linked to the traditional farming practised in the Western Stara Planina with wool from sheep grazing in mountain pastures and herbs, flowers and minerals collected locally to colour the wool. Furthermore, Kilim weaving in Chiprovtsi Municipality (MON36) is considered an important part of Bulgarian national heritage and was inscribed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2014.   A combination of assets are used: the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) plus the cultural heritage of the Kilim weaving tradition.    Whilst local sheep production remains a reliable source of wool, the local kilim industry has declined in recent years because of the loss of important markets - especially the lucrative, but very competitive, international market. Consequently the town and municipality have above average levels of unemployment with associated population loss and on-going demographic decline. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
