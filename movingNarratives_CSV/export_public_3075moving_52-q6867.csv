Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 ES. The Starlight sites are scenarios that incorporate the preservation and observation of the sky as part of the natural, scenic, cultural and scientific heritage and encourage Star Tourism , promoting infrastructure, products, activities and training of specialized guides in sustainable tourism. The VC is endorsed by the Starlight Foundation, born in 2007 with the 'Declaration in Defense of the Night Sky and the Right to Starlight and is an action of UNESCO supported by the International Astronomical Union. The key actors are: Starlight Foundation, Asociación para el Dessarrollo Integral (ADIT) de Sierra Morena Cordobesa; Grupo Desarrollo Rural (GDR) Sierra Morena Cordobesa, local municipalities, and accomodation services. It highly depends on the willingness of the municipalities to preserve the night sky and their engagement with the project.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena.

This VC aims to promote the night sky as a local asset, developing this way a local and regional sustainable tourism. This asset is highly threatened by the increase in light pollution that comes along with urban sprawl. The innovation comes with considering sky as an asset with recreational and cultural potential that needs to be first protected and then enjoyed and ackowledged as something of great value for human well-being.   To protect the already threatened night sky; to promote sustainable tourism based on night sky observation and engagement with local assets, and to therefore challenge the mainstream tourism model. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. This VC is innovative as it considers night sky as a touristic asset, and develops an alternative and sustainable regional tourism model. It is initiated by the declaration of Starlight Reserves for the conservation of night skies and by broadcasting astronomy through courses, seminars and other activities. The innovation is both endogenous and exogenous because the Starlight Foundation is a worldwide organisation. However, the VC of our interest is developed by the localities who decide to join the initiative, fostering the same goals for their regions. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Night sky. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is present in 2 Starlight Reserves within Sierra Morena. The Sierra Morena reserve includes 8 municipalities: Montoro (14043), Obejo (14047), Adamuz (14001), Villaharta (14068), Espiel (14026), Villanueva del Rey (14071), Villaviciosa de Córdoba (14073) y Hornachuelos (14036).
