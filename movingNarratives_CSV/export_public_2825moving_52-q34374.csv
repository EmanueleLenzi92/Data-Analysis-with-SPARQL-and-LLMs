Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 GR. Traditionally, the female members of the family are involved in the processing of the milk and the preparation of the wheat in order to produce xinochontros (ksinochondros). Still a widely home-made product in Crete, ksinochondros has become the output of a successful women's cooperative in the area of Gergeri. The activity interconnects to the sheep and goat breeding, the local festivities and the gastronomy. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Psiloritis Mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Anogeia. Psiloritis (Ida) mountain is the highest maountain in Crete and among the highest in Greece, characterized as a Unesco Global Geopark. Phrygana and macchia vegetation dominate up to an altitude of 1,600 meters. The typical maquis vegetation of Psiloritis includes prinos, while scattered are piles of rough pine, cypresses and maples that form clusters up to a height of 1,800 meters. At higher altitudes the vegetation consists of bushes mainly of thorny plants, such as heather. Around Anogeia the shrubby vegetation is prevelant. Relatively close to the town there exist the Skinakas observatory and the Idaion Andron Cave, the cave that Zeus was born, according the Greek mythology. The size of the area (km2) is 102.1.

In the Cretan delicatessen, Xinochontros (Ksinochondros), the traditional frumeny, keeps an important role both in terms of taste and nutritional value. Xinochontros combines the protein from milk and the unprocessed carbohydrates of wheat. In the past, wheat was grounded in a hand mill, an essential tool for every household. Sour milk is the product obtained by mixing sour milk and fat. Anogeia is located in north-eastern slopes of Psiloritis. The high reputation of Xinochontros in Crete makes the VC of high importance for the people in the wider area of Anogeia. The product is strongly connected to the area due to its land morphology and the high quality of milk (sheep and goats). Xinochontros is a traditional product that was a key component of the household economy which in recent years due to their multiple-use has acquired business interest. For this reason today it is produced with modern methods and procedures by small dairy factories. Such a small dairy factory in Anogeia contributes, distributes and promotes sour cream with significant social, cultural and economic benefit for the wider area. The product is distributed to a significant degree through the local networking and the reputation of the product all over Crete. New marketing strategies involve the promotion of the product through gastronomic events and TV shows. The land use for animal breeding (sheep and goats) is predominant in an area with close proximity to the forest of Rouvas. The SES of the area depends on a series of activites based on livestock, which interconect with the production of xinochondros, an integral part of the diet of the mountaineers of Crete and a favourite ingredient of the Cretan cuisine. Livestock in the wider area of Anogeia focuses mainly on dairy sheep and goats breeds, although the traditional sheep/goat breading has become economically unprofitable and heavily dependent on the European subcidies. Ksinochondros, a relatively high priced product, can give a prospect to the graziers. It is a traditional product, not well known in the new generation of consumers. The high quality of milk in combination with high quality of local wheat create a unique product which could be called as super food. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation refers to the characteristics of sour cream, a product with high shelf life, low production costs, high nutritional value from local resources. In addition to its close connection with local productions in the wider region and mainly in the economic impact of the product in the region. Lately ksinochondros has penetrated in the gastronomy of Greece as a traditional alternative to cereals in breakfast. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Xinochontros (ksinochondros) is produced in several places in Crete."
