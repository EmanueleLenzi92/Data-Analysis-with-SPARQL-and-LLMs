Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 16 CH2. The trout farming has existed since 1959 in the form of a small family production. There are two different sites: the breeding is in Soubey (in the spring water) and the storage and slaughtering are in Courtemaîche, where the sale is also done.

The only trout producer in the canton of Jura (unique product), raised in fresh water of the Doubs river and without antibiotics, environmentally friendly fish farming.   The trout are produced in the spring water in Soubey (Doubs river) and are therefore directly dependent on the quantity and quality of the river water.    The river Doubs on which the production is based suffers from numerous droughts (almost total drying up in some areas in 2018). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are River. The local assets include Natural."
