Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 ES. This area falls under the protection of the PDO Ribeira Sacra, wich proctects and promotes the wines produced in this area using tradicional means and practices. The chestnut production can be distinguish by the PGI Castaña de Galicia, this quality scheme protects all the chestnut produced in the autonomous region of Galicia and doesn't distinguish the chestnut produced in the mountains. Most of the primary producers of both the chestnut and the grapes are small families that own the land. They usually sell the fruits to bigger companies that transform them into other vuel added products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Galician Massif. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is A Pobra de Trives. The landscape presents great differences in altitude the rivers flow at an altitude aroun 300m and from there the altitude raises sharply. A lot of the riverside is occupied by terraces were the grapes are produced. As you go away from the river and the terrain get flat it becomes easy to find forest of oak, chestnuts, gorse etc.   The size of the area (km2) is 84.17. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 300. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1730. The total population (in thousand) is 2014. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 24. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -4.97%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 91.35. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.55%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 20281. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 61663.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.30%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 25.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 62. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 5.3. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 25.6. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 69.1.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 393. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.40%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 12821. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 72.6.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 24.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 71.10%.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.3.   The chestnuts and wines produced in ribeira Sacra, specially in the Quiroga-Bibei subzone, were historically know for their superior quality and provided a high economic yield. Despite these facts this area has suffered from demografic ageging as well as from a demographic decline. Most of the chestnut forest is currently abandoned and the vineyards are getting progressively abandoned as well because the people that upkeep them are ageging and there is not a continuity in this labors.   The microclimate of the Ribeira Sacra allows this region to produce some of the finest spanish wines. It also favours the chestnut production giving it a caliber and a sweet taste that are very valued in the market, specially for roasting.    The lack of formation on the maintenance and exploitation of both the chestnut and the vineyards represents a huge barrier for the incorporation of the local youth to the local value chains. Formation on the bussiness side of the activity is also required. Most of the grape producers lack formation on enology making it really hard to step up on their bussiness transforming it into more valuable goods as wine and liquor. Also the spread of Dryocosmus kuriphilus is damaging the productivity and viability of the local chestnut forest. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as N/A.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are N/A. The local assets include N/A.   This value chain is also present in most of the mountain areas of the spanish north and north-west. Similar VC can be found in other states such as Italy or France."
