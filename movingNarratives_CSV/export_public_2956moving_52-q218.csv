Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 RO. The Aberdeen Angus cattle breed was first introduced into Romania in the 1960s, but has become increasingly popular in the Carpathians because of its suitability for the pedoclimatic conditions and extensive breeding systems that exist in the mountains. As the cattle breed has become more established the range of processing meat products has become more diverse and this salami is the most recent new products to appear on the market. This new Aberdeen Angus Salami is a 'raw-dried' salami - this is the most popular type of salami in Romania because of its high % content of meat and ingredients used.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Schela commune in Gorj County (RO412).

The production of this Aberdeen Angus Salami in the Schela commune (81987) in Gorj County (RO412) is very innovative for the Romanian charcuterie market. Combined with its image and registration as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/salam-montan-angus/) this creates a strong brand image with potential to be very profitable value chain and thereby help ensure the continued maintenance of the valuable semi-natural (HNV) grasslands being grazed by Aberdeen Angus cattle in the Southern Romanian Carpathians. Salami is very popular in Romania and accounts for the majority (40%) of all processed meat products consumed, followed by sausages.   The natural asset used for producing Angus beef and beef products, such as 'Salam Montan Angus', is the semi-natural and alpine grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing) in the mountain areas of Gorj County (RO412). Many of the communal pastures used for grazing sheep and cattle are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    With good branding and marketing an innovative and high quality product such as this has much potential in the rapidly growing market for 'raw-dried' salami, but it also inevitably faces much competition. For example, 'Salam de Sibiu' from the neighbouring country of Sibiu is an emblematic Romanian product with PGI status and unprecedented popularity (over 50% market share) based on 100 years of market presence. On the other hand, there are also many other cheaper (lower quality) brands which dominate the remaining proportion of the market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Pork meat and pork meat products are most popular in Romania, followed by chicken. Beef is increasing in popularity, but mainly as fresh cuts. It is very unusual to find processed beef products, especially a beef salami. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
