Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 CZ. Farms - cattle breeding, cattle husbandry, grazing, perennial grassland management. Farms implement organic farming methods. Most farms are capable of processing their own milk. The VC impact positively on economy of farms and regional economy. Cattle farms are important for delivering ecosystem services in the mountain region.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Javorníky/Beskydy (Western Carpathian) mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Vsetín. Mountain Reference Landscape (LAU 1 - Vsetín) is the area with high share of highlands and forests. The Reference Landscape includes the nature protected area, which is the largest in the Czech Republic (555 km2). The most valuable asset of the Reference Landscape is the unique nature. The Reference Landscape thus provide very attractive conditions for tourism. The nature protected area located in the region is considered one of the most valuable locations in Europe. The landscape is historically known for extensive farming in perennial grassland, namely sheep and cattle.   The size of the area (km2) is 1143. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 173. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1206. The total population (in thousand) is 143.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 125.4. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.95%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 131.62. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.49%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9501.15. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9253.38. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.60%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 50.50%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 46.90%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9335.88. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 18439.35. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.97%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 45.43%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 51.60%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 29759. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.51%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3815. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 45. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 49.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 48.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.24%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.99%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 50.77%.   Cattle husbandry on perennial grassland is a part of a typical image associated with agriculture in Beskydy mountains. The farms often operate in less favorable areas, they use organic farming methods and differentiate their products from conventional farms. Farms often produces and process their own milks. The dairy products are sold directly on farm, or via farmers markets and farmers shops.   Mountain areas provide natural resources that allow implementation of organic methods. The farming methods are adjusted to ecosystems. At the same time the high nature value is reflected in products that are marketed as 'pure' and 'natural'.    Reliance on subsidy schemes, effective marketing that allows them to sell quality products wigh high premiums, provision of ecosystem services in times of global climate change (less rainfalls, not enough grass for animals). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   It is likely that the VCs spans over the country borders. Similar examples can be thus found in Germany and Austria."
