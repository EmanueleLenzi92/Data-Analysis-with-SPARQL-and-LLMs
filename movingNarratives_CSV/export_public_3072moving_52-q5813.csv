Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 48 ES. Traditional charcoal making is the craft of making charcoal from firewood. This has been an essential source of heat, used for cooking or heating houses. The charcoal maker makes charcoal by building an oven. Since the 16th century, there is evidence of regulations for making charcoal in the Canary Islands mountains. It is a local, ecological product and an example of a renewable resource that promotes the economy and employment in mountain areas, fostering rural development in the Biosphere Reserve of Gran Canaria, thus strengthening its population. It is sold locally in gas stations and stores in San Mateo, Tejeda, and Artenara.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Gran Canaria Island. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Tejeda. Carbón de La Cumbre's activity helps with the removal of dry wood from the forest. Therefore the prevention of forest fires generates economic activity and employment while maintaining an important cultural tradition. The most recent initiative offers, in addition to environmental benefits, the possibility of articulating a public-private collaboration initiative to manage natural ecosystems.   The size of the area (km2) is 103.3. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 120. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1860. The total population (in thousand) is 1.883.

The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 300. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.03%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18559. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 15777.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.24%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 12.56%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 86.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9487. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 41468.7. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.74%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 11.28%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 87.98%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 451. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,10 %. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 65. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 38.3. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 86.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 85.10%.   The Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve is one of the few that keep the charcoal industry alive. In 2014, thanks to the collaboration between the charcoal makers grouped in the 'Asociación Charamusco Carboneros de la Cumbre' and the technicians of the Environmental Service of the Cabildo, the brand CARBÓN DE LA CUMBRE was registered.   La Cumbre charcoal is made from raw material from the dry wood of species that grow spontaneously (almond and broom) and without any chemical products.    The main challenge is to make sustainable a small artisanal production, linked to the forest's local resources with the industrial type commercial offers that flood the market with very cheap charcoal offers. On the other hand, maintaining in this context the interest of charcoal makers in a complementary and economically unprofitable activity is another critical challenge, together with the need to carry out a regenerative practice of the forest and not an extractive one. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although it provides innovative nuances by linking an associative structure that brings together the charcoal producers in collaboration with the institution responsible for the Gran Canaria Biosphere Reserve, this is a traditional value chain. On the other hand, Carbón de La Cumbre intends to obtain the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certificate for good practices and sustainable forest use, as the vast majority of forest areas in Gran Canaria are already recognized. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There has been an extraordinary activity of charcoal production from vegetal remains from the forest or derived from tree pruning in many other European regions. This is also the case of the traditional charcoal and picón production in Andalusia or the charcoal-making traditions in the Basque Country and Navarre."
