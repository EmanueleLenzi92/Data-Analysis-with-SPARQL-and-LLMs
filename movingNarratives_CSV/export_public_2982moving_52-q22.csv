Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 23 UK. Winters sports, in this instance Lecht ski resort depend on maintenance of the land in the area (i.e., ensuring it is releatively undisturbed in summer) so that it can be utilised for winter sports in the winter time from roughly Decemeber to April. The Lecht ski centre directly employs 15.5 seasonal staff, but other jobs have been created / maintained through provision of local tourist accomodation in Tomintoul - 6 miles from the Lecht and even further afield within the rest of the Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City LAU1 areas. Also, throughout Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen city there is also job provision from equipment hire shops (to serve the Lecht and other nearby ski slopes. It can link to other local tourism opportuntities (i.e. Tomintoul whisky distillery in the nearly Badendoch and Strathspey LAU1 region). No figures could be found on the economic value of the ski centre.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); North Eastern Scotland (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Aberdeenshire. Aberdeenshire is in the north-east of Scotland and is a highly diverse landscape, with a long coastline, lowland agricultural areas, large rivers and the mountains and valleys of the Cairngorms. It surrounds the city of Aberdeen and contains several towns, including six settlements with a population of over 10,000. The oil and gas industry is a key economic sector, with land-based industries and tourism more important in the rural parts of the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 6317.996. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -3. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1307. The total population (in thousand) is 261.21. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 41.34. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.90%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 75.32. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.12%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 24463.99. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 20611.27. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.46%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 28.09%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.45%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 24463.99. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 20611.27. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.46%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.09%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 69.45%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 14233. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 100.00%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 8612. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 51.7. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 23.08%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 73.63%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.08%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.63%.   For example: successful registration of a quality scheme, high quality product(s), high reputation product(s), prevalence of the connected land use system(s) in the area, particulary treathen land use system(s) or natural asset(s), territorial idendity, e-commerce. The wind-powered snow factory represents both a new product (snow factory) and new process (powered through renewable energy).   Lecht ski resort depend on a range of natural, cultural and social assets. In terms of natural assets in relies on the attractive landscape to both provide the basis for the skiing, but also the pleasant surroundings (which encourage visitors to come). They also depend on good snowfall to ensure they can open for as long a season as possible (also to enable artifical snow-making). In terms of social assets, cairngorms ski resort are dependent on good community realtions both with the Cairngorms National Park Authortiy, the land owners and the local tourism operators and residents of the local village Tomintoul. Without their support the ski resort would likely fail. In terms of cultural assets there is a reliance on local traditional knowledge for Lecht-specific ski knowledge and as an important part of local childhood. Also there Lecht is dependent on local Braemar Mountain Rescue team www.braemarmountainrescue.org.uk who voluntarily serve the surrounding mountains if hillwalkers/ Skiiers/snowboarders injure themselves whilst on the mountains. These volunteers are required to live locally and need long-term experiences with the local area.    Future issues concern lack of snowsports possiblity due to climate change impacts, and current closures from COVID - potential for land to be used for more specifically land-connected activities but these may not be so profitable or helpful for resilience (i.e. in terms of wider jobs and tourism). There is also tension betwen habitat designations on the plateau and the ski slopes providing access to these areas (and infrastrcuture e.g. car parks, cafes). The tension between tourism and conservation is at the heart of the reason why the National park was designated. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The use of the wind turbine to power the snow factory is innovative as it both extends the season for skiing and improves its reliability (and thus economic sustainability), but also is drawing on renewable energy. Nowhere else in the UK powers their snowmaking through such innovative means, however there is existing use of renewable energy sources within ski resorts, thus the innovation is exogenous. The Cairngorms resort is currently reviewing plans to power its snowmaking through sustainably produced HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) to reduce its reliance on diesel for their snow cannons. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include natural land but it is managed to an extent -i.e. no trees, not too much heather etc to encourage snowfall retention on the slopes.   The cairngorms ski resort www.cairngormmountain.co.uk and Glenshee www.ski-glenshee.co.uk are within the Cairngorms national park too. Glenshee is also on the edge of Aberdeenshire. There are two other ski resorts across Scotland (Nevis range and Glencoe) and cross-country skiing in Huntly (Aberdeenshire LAU1) and several smaller ski fields in England (i.e., Helvellyn in Lake District - LAU1 Eden and Weardale in LAU1 County Durham. Sledging is also possible at several of these sites and there are indoor and 'dry' (aritficial) ski slopes throughout the UK."
