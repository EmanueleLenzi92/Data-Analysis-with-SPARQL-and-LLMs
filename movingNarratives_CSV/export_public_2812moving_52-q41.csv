Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 GR. Local SES presents very high dependency to the VC, as olive oil production is the main agricultural activity of the area. Product quality is ensured through traditional family practices of fruit collection and oliveoil extraction, but the area, as the rest of the island, lacks a labeling scheme and the product is usually sold in bulk with a great percentage of it being exported and bottled in EU countries. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Psiloritis Mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is MYLOPOTAMOS. The location is situated at the northern foothills of the highest peak on the island, the Idi mountain range. The highest peak of the mountain is 2,456m and the surrounding area is characterized by high altitude rocky fields, with various small valleys of fertile soil. The highest altitudes levels close to the mountain range peak are rocky, arid and without plantation or trees. The foothills of the mountain range have a mixture of rocky and fertile landscape. The size of the area (km2) is 170. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 200. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 900. The total population (in thousand) is 87.691. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 58.80. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.02%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.01%. The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13800. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1046.08. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 6.52%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 9.33%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 84.16%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 14300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 7862.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 11.24%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 81.85%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 6998. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.204%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 13024. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.38%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.83%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 70.79%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.97%.   The PDO olive oil from north mountainous Mylopotamos area is of high reputation, with rare quality characteristics, related to the particular landscape of the area. The olive trees are in high altitutdes and their oil is produced under traditional methods, with the main factors differentiating the product quality being the climate, the soil composition, the variety of the trees and the human cultivation processes. Olive-oil and related products are distinctive of Greek and Cretan ancient history tradition. This VC is one of the most typical traditional production processes and of the top quality products in the world. The products exhibit significant characteristics of nutritious, therapeutic and cosmetic properties, making them a primary source for direct production but also several by-products. The mountainous area is optimal for olive trees' growth and exceptional quality product. The altitude and aridity of the climate, together with specific soil characteristics of rocky landscape, is typical of local olive trees adaptaion to climate, with some plantations including centuries old trees. The final products are of high reputation and production practices include families and communities involvement. Olive oil production is sustainable when following traditional cultivation processes, especially on soil that is particularly suitable for the needs of olive trees. The island of Crete provides many areas suitable for olive trees cultivation, but the motivation for increased productivity and the expansion to non-suitable areas increases the unsustainable use of fertilizers and water. Moreover, climate change is raising some uncertainty factors, epsecially in tree diseases that are prospering in higher temperature and humidity conditions, leading to unsustainable use of pesticides. Moreover, a challenge for local producers arises against low-cost imports competition from non-EU countries. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. A long history of tradition in agricultural practices has developed a list of strictly defined processes so as to adapt to the particular environment and produce high quality product. The cultures follow specific distances between trees, limited tree-specific drip-irrigation, organic fertilizers from sheep adjusted to each tree's age and production stage, restricted use of non-organic fertilizers, traditional practices of pruning, bait traps against olive-fruit flies infestation, restricted use of non-residual pesticides, olive-fruit collection with traditional practices. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Similar VCs based on olive trees can be identified in Western Macedonia (MRL - NUTS3 : EL431, EL432, EL434)."
