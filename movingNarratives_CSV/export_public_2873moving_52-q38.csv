'Federico Di Iorio' produces high quality confectioneries using traditional recipes but also adding, in some cases, new ingredients. This artisanal factory received several prestigious awards in international trade fairs since the early 1900s (Milan, 1911; Belgium 1923; London, 1925: Brussels, 1939). In 2021 the 'Federico Di Iorio' company won the silver medal in the 'Innovative Easter Dove Bread' category at the national competition 'Miglior colomba d Italia 2021'. In that occasion, it was proposed an Easter dove bread made with a dough of 8 cereal flour types and filled with pineapple and chocolate. 'Di Iorio' produces different kinds of confectioneries, and the line 'Vecchia maniera' (the old-fashioned way production) is made with the traditional recipes and only Italian root materials (almonds, sugar, flour, butter, etc.). In the SES, the production of nougat is traditional. However, the 'Di Iorio' factory has diversified its production with other conventional Italian confectionery products and innovated the products more in line with consumers' needs and interests. The company has also invested in online commerce. They stress high-quality productions and their awards.   Gastronomic and confectionery culture is predominant in this VC. Several local products, such as honey, are used for production, but historically other products come from other SESs. Thus the VC connects several SES. However, strong connections with local agricultural production are not stressed.    In the high-quality traditional confectionery sector, innovation and the origin of raw materials are competitive factors. In the case of 'Di Iorio', innovation crosses local (i.e., nougat) and national (panettone, Easter eggs, dove bread, etc.) gastronomic culture. However, the origin of the raw materials is not always local. Although this is not in contradiction with the local tradition (since the Romans time, the SES is connected by trades with distant areas), it may pose a problem in communication strategies. For example, in the case of nougat, traditionally, almonds come from the Apulia region while honey is local. At the same time, in the business communication lacks a link with the local social context and environment settings. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. In this case 'Di Iorio' experiments with confectionery innovations by combining local and non-local products. Local confectionery production embeds traditional skills and culture with gastronome and confectionery sciences. They also invested in e-commerce for direct sale and opened social profile for direct communication with customers. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are The land is not a topic stressed in this VC. The local assets include Cultural (The 'Di Iorio' family acquired specific skills in the confectionery sector by their family tradition and professional training.)."
