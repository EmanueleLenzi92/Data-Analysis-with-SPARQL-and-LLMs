Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 32 ES. In the municipality of Zuheros there are about nine livestock farms that usually combine sheep and goats, most of them in semi-extensive regime, totaling about 10,000 head of livestock. Each sheep farm has an average of 500 sheep grazing on several hundred hectares of mountain range. The main resource is obtained from the sale of sheep with an average weight of ten kilos and a price close to 50 € / piece, stable for years. The sheep are sold to feedlots located mainly in the provinces of Granada and Murcia. There is no sectoral associative structure and certified organic production is not very relevant.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zuheros. Sheep farming with similar characteristics extends to other municipalities of the Sierras Subbéticas Cordobesas (Cabra, Priego de Córdoba, Luque and Carcabuey), and also to areas of the province of Córdoba and other Andalusian provinces such as Granada and Seville. Greece, Romania, Italy and France are other EU countries where sheep farming is important.   The size of the area (km2) is 42.36. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500.

Traditionally, the Andalusian mountains have hosted an extensive livestock activity, mainly goats and sheep, based on the use of pastures and focused on the production of goat's milk and cheese, as well as the sale of goats and lambs for meat.   The resources in terms of farms, pastures, livestock and shepherds are local, although the infrastructure and housing associated with these farms have sometimes been abandoned or are in serious disrepair. There are no known plans for sustainable forest and pastures management. Supplementary feed is purchased from outside the production area.    It is a value chain with very little innovation that must ensure sustainable management of the forest and pastures, gain in diversification and fight against the difficult generational renewal of shepherds and average profitability of farms. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. There are no innovative elements in the value chain, which represents a serious challenge to guarantee the medium-term sustainability of these farms, which are also sometimes located in areas that are difficult to access and do not have facilities that make management attractive. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Sheep farming with similar characteristics extends to other municipalities of the Sierras Subbéticas Cordobesas (Cabra, Priego de Córdoba, Luque and Carcabuey), and also to areas of the province of Córdoba and other Andalusian provinces such as Granada and Seville. Greece, Romania, Italy and France are other EU countries where sheep farming is important."
