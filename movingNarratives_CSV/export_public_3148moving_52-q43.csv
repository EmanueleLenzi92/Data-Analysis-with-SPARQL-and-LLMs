Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 TR. The number of farmers engaged in goat and sheep breeding in the region is 1179 and 1572, respectively. Since pasture areas are insufficient, goat and sheep breeders purchase feed from feed suppliers. However, high feed prices increase the cost of production. The most frequently used marketing channels for product sales are usually retailers, companies and traders from outside the region. In addition, it is observed that the producers make direct sales to consumers and hotels. However, direct sales are not at a high level. One of the most important problems in the value chain is the marketing of high quality products at low prices. The producers are trying to avoid this problem by selling directly. It is seen that the producers are members of the Sheep and Goat Breeders Association in Antalya. This union takes part in the implementation of animal breeding programs at the regional level to increase productivity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Bey mountains, Antalya. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Korkuteli. Korkuteli is a district of Antalya Province in the Mediterranean region of Turkey, 56 km (35 mi) north-west of the city of Antalya.Korkuteli is an area of small plains and hills in the Bey Dağları, the western range of the Taurus Mountains, overlooking the Mediterranean sea. There are two distinct geographical areas of Korkuteli, of equal size: the lowland area nearer the coast has a hot Mediterranean climate, while the larger area of lakes higher up is cooler and less humid. The high country is covered with pine forest, while the lowland is used for agriculture; crops include grains, pulses and vegetable oil-seeds. There are trout in Korkuteli reservoir and other small lakes (Wikipedia,2021).   The size of the area (km2) is 2471. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1020. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2000. The total population (in thousand) is 55.588. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 22.5. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 10.23%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 89.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 21.23%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9553.01. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 22425.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 8.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 19.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.00%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 8881.82. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 25421.01. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 21.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 66.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 599838. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 98.70%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 39533. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is Medium. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is Low. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is High. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 68.40%.   Korkuteli is one of the areas with high concentrations of endemic plants in Turkey. The milk of the animals fed on endemic herbs in the pastures in the region is both high quality and aromatic. The quality of milk increases the demand for milk and dairy products. There is a particularly high demand for goat's milk. A special ice cream known as 'burnt ice cream' is produced in the region. This ice cream has a reputation both in the region and throughout the country. The raw material of this ice cream is provided from goat milk produced in Korkuteli. 99% of goat breeders are smallholder farms.   Natural: There are many endemic plant species in the region. https://www.dogadernegi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/akd018-beydaglari-onemli-doga-alanlari-kitabi.pdf Social: Sheep and goat breeding are very common in the region. Especially goat breeding has been carried out in the region for a long time. 99% of goat and sheep breeders are smallholder farms. Cultural: Goat breeding is a traditional production activity in the region. For this reason, it fully fits the definition of cultural heritage. Goat breeding is transferred from families to children as a cultural heritage.    The inadequacy of pasture and high feed costs in the region are the most important challenges faced by sheep and goat breeders. In addition to these, there are other important challenges facing producers. Although the sheep and goat breeders supply high quality products to the market, they cannot get high prices for their products. The farmers have not transportation facilities to carry their produce to the markets. The animal diseases mostly affect sheep and goat breeders. This is a challenge for goat and sheep breeders. Moreover, there is no farmer organization in the form of an agricultural cooperative for goat and sheep breeders in the region. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Apple and grape are traditionally produced in Elmalı. Greenhouse tomato cultivation in Elmalı has developed later as a more profitable production activity compared to other enterprises. In addition, the products grown are healthier because less input is used in highland greenhouse cultivation. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is also present in other MRLs in the Member States such as Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Serbia, Switzerland, Spain, and Austria."
