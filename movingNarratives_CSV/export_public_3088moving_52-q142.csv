Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 29 ES. Ganso Ibérico (Iberian Goose) is the only company producing goose in the dehesa. The farm has a field of 1500 ha of dehesa where the geese live freely in plots of 200 ha that they rotate to maintain the grass. Their product has the organic certification. They import the goose chicks from France when they have less than 2 days of age. The breeds they use are Toulouse and Embdem. They work with batches of 2000 geese and their total production goes beyond the 9000 animals per year. They sell eggs, raw meat and some elaborated products mostly to restaurants and gourmet stores. Most of their production is exported outside Spain (around the 80% in 2013).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Constantina.

Successful innovative product in the region, and diversification in the VCs linked to the dehesas. Not only they sell the eggs and the meat, but they also cure the meat to produce a sausage with high densities of oleic acids caused by the use of acorns in their diets, similar to the iberian ham.   Access to intrnational markets where the goose consumption is more common than in Spain. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. This VC is about breeding of goose in the dehesa ecosystem for the production of goose meat and eggs. The area is on the route of migratory geese. So, back in 2010, the producer thought that it would be also adequate to breed geese in this area with market purposes. Still today there is only one company producing goose products in the dehesa. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural."
