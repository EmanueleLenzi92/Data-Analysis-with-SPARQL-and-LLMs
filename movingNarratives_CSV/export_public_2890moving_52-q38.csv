Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 29 IT. The viticultural activity on the island is performed by a small number of individual wine producers mostly concentrated on the production of sweet wine. As this type of wine is not easy to commercialise, an innovative wine producer decides to amplify his production introducing high quality dry wines. At the same time he implements a new marketing strategy leaning on the huge touristic flow in the area offering a possibility to stay in a modern wine resort and numerous tailor-made tasting and gastronomic experiences. The wine is distributed in the folowing main channels: private clients (tourists), e-commerce and export.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Aeolian Islands. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Lipari. Lipari is the largest of a chain of the Aeolian islands in a volcanic archipelago situated in between Vesuvius and Etna in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the northern coast of Sicily, southern Italy. As a result of its volcanic origin, the island is covered with pumice and obsidian. From April till October the area receives an important touristic flow.   The size of the area (km2) is 89.72.

High quality wines, value creation from the recuperation of traditional varieties (Corinto Nero) and viticultural techniques (alberello pruning system), active engagement of tourists as main consumers and ambassadors of the product in Italy and abroad, successful implementation of e-commerce and active use of export channel. Traditional wine produced in the island under the denomination 'Malvasia delle Lipari' is a sweet dessert wine from the dried Malvasia grapes The main actor of the VC introduced a range of high quality dry wines using Corinto Nero variety with was on the verge of the extinction. He also implemented new marketing strategies adressed to massive touristic flow on the island.   Key local assets involve mainly specific lanscape and scenary, sea resorts and unique geological formations as Kaolin Quarries which are attractive for tourists from Italy and abroad. The main resources for the local viticulture are the autochnotous grape varieties (Malvasia and Corinto Nero) and volcanic soils, having specific characteristics valuable for wine production.    A common challenge for small island viticulture is the isolation from the main land which causes extremely high cost of production. Steep slopes and traditional type of pruning makes mechanization impractical and requires a lot of manual operations. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. First innovation of this VC is the return to using of an abandoned autochtonous variety from the area, recuperated thanks to mass and clonal selection. Second innovation is the implementation of a high-level wine resort in the middle of the vineyards and offering a wide range of tasting and gastronomic activities. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, natural land and Vineyard and other cultures in the area as olive trees and cappers. The local assets include Natural."
