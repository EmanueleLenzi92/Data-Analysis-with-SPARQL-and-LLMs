Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 BG. Production of soft fruit in Berkovitsa declined immediately after the collapse of the communist regime in 1989, but has now been largely re-established. Many of the restored strawberry and raspberry plantations are now organically certified to take advantage of the signifiant export opportunities that exist and a number of foreign companies have established collection points and processing units for exporting a range of frozen organic soft fruits all over Europe. These plantations of high value soft fruit are economically very important for the local community. Meanwhile some niche markets also exist for other celebrated local products, such as 'malinovo vino' (raspberry wine) and 'yagodovo vino' (strawberry wine).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Berkovitsa Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes. Berkovitsa is a small municipality which is predominantly (60%) forest with 40% agricultural land consisting mainly of rough upland grazing (natural high mountain pastures, riparian meadows, stony or rocky terrain). There are also some semi-natural (secondary) grasslands created by the clearance of patches of forest. Some small plots of cultivated land also exist, including the permanent plantations of strawberries and raspberries mentioned above.   The size of the area (km2) is 465. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 16.343. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 35.15. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 39.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.19%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 4600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 524. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 13.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3402. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1497. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 18.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 19010. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 27.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.50%.   The Berkovitsa Municipality (MON02) in Montana Province (BG312) was well-known during the communist period for strawberry and raspberry production. After the political reforms and economic crises of the 1990s many plantations were abandoned, but have now been re-established and are flourishing again through their connection with well-established value chains into the (organic) food markets of western Europe.   The combination of climate, soils and altitude on the northern slopes of the Western Stara Planina is very favourable for soft fruit production.    The rural population in the region is 50% of what it used to be in the 1960s and the remaining inhabitants are increasingly elderly. Maintenance of an active workforce is therefore a major challenge which puts soft fruit growers under increasing pressure. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural."
