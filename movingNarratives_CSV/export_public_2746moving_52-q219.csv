Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 BG. Borovets is the oldest Bulgarian winter resort with a history that dates back to 1896. It gradually developed into a modern ski resort with hotels, restaurants, bars and a network of ski runs and lifts along the slopes of the Rila Mountains providing for a whole range of winter sports. Duinrg the previous communist regime, the resort twice hosted World Cup Alpine Skiing rounds in 1981 and 1984.

The reference mountain chain of this VC is Rila Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Samokov Municipality in Sofia Province (BG412). Sofia Province (BG412) is the second-largest province in Bulgaria with 22 municipalities. The overall relief of the province is highly diverse and it has an altitude range from 350 - 2,925 metres. Within its territory, the province encompasses parts of three mountain ranges: the Western Stara Planina in the north, Sredna Gora in the east and Rila mountains in the south-west. It also fully encompasses the individual Plana and Vitosha mountains. All mountains are separated by fertile valleys. The local economy is heavily industrialised with a long history of mining and manufacturing. Tourism is also very important, whilst agriculture is a relatively minor sector of the economy. Samokov municipality (SFO39) is in the south-west of the province in the Rila mountains which reach an altitude of 2,925 metres and are the highest mountains in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula.

Borovets in the Samokov Municipality (SFO39) in Sofia Province (BG412) is the oldest and largest ski resort in Bulgaria. It has World Cup class slopes for downhill skiing, plus many cross-country and biathalon tracks too, and is an important part of the Balkan Holidays (tour operator) portfolio.   Located on the northern slopes on the northern slopes of the Rila mountains at an altitude of 1,350 metres.    Favourable winter weather conditions and especially snow availability and depth are clearly crucial for the satisfaction of visitors to ski resorts and a key factor for the maintained viability of winter tourism in mountain regions. In common with many other ski resorts (especially low-medium altitude) it is anticipated that Borovets will be negatively affected by the future impact of climate change and the increasing frequency of snow-deficient winters in the next 20-25 years. It is anticipated that the likelihood of reduced visitor numbers will pose the most immediate threat to the small accommodation establishments that offer limited services, such as bed and breakfast only. Larger hotels with qualified staff, flexible marketing abilities and the capacity to offer diverse tourist products (such as meetings, spas and non-snow sports) are currently assessed to be more resilient. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural."
