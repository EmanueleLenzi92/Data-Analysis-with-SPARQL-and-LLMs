Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 SCA. The fishing season goes from May to September and attracts many recreational anglers to its diverse fishing spots. The Hemsedal Fishing Association holds a joint fishing licence applicable to five rivers (Hemsila, Grøndøla, Bulinåne, Mørkedøla and More Kvam) and 18 lakes. In addition, Tor Grøthe (expert fly fisherman), in collaboration with the tourism office of Hemsedal, offers various touristic packages of fishing guide plus accomodation in his farm for enthusiasts.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Hemsedal. Hemsedal is a mountainous municipallity whose economy is focussed on tourism. It has one of the main ski lodges in the country with skiing routes from three peaks above 1000 meters , snow parks, competition infrastrutcures and rutes and off-piste terrain. During summer, the recreative offer turns into fly fishing, hunting, hiking, climbing and summer farm visits.   The size of the area (km2) is 753.52.

Fly fishing is a traditional practice in Scandinavia due to the water streams that fow along its mountains and valleys with clean and cold water. These characteristics are important for the VC as trouts and other salmonid fishes find in these waters their natural habitat.   The natural assets are the five rivers and 18 lakes where fly fishing can be practiced in Hemsedal. All of them are healthy ecosystems with high quality waters, which make them ideal habitats for trouts. The social assets are all the values that underpin this activity regarding respect for the animals and their habitats, the use of specific techniques and tools and proper behaviour. Finally, fly fishing represents a traditional practice for many anglers that have learnt it from the previous generations and have been doing it during their whole lives.    Climate change may be the main challenge for this VC. Water streams in Nordic areas are expected to suffer more floods and changes in water temperature with the consequent impact on the micro biota and biochemical processes that occur in water. Therefore, water quality and biochemical parameters may change, thus altering the whole water ecosystem. Trouts and salmons are the main fish species for fly fishing in this area. Although both are quite sensible to these changes, trouts are lower thermal tolerance, hence being more vulnerable under this scenario. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Mountain rivers and lakes. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Similar VC can be found in Nore og Uvdal (0633)."
