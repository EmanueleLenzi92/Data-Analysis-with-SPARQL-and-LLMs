This is enforced the social bonds.    Chestnut is both picked up naturally and done agriculture in Bozdağ. The major problem is chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica). This diseases are seen especially picked up chestnut naturally. Acess to chestnut trees are tough because of roads. Cold storages are not enough so farmers have to sell products quickly. This decreases selling price. Chestnut processing plants are not enough. Three companies produce chestnut packaging and chestnut candy in Ödemiş district (Ödemiş Commadity Exchange Chestnuts report, 2019). Mostly, chestnuts are picked up by women and childs.
