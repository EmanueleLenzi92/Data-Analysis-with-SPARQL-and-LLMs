Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 42 IT. la Cattedra (the common farm) focusses on producing organic vegetables, berries (blueberry, strawberry and raspberry) and hazelnuts. The vegetables are sold through organic specialty shops, the berries are either sold fresh in organic specialty shops or processed into jams by the local large organic jams company. Hazelnuts will be processed by the local large organic jams company. There is also a small beer production for local circuits. In general all productions look for local processors, so to maintain the added value locally. But the most important value of the farm is the demonstration potential. As a good example it wants to promote a change in all local farmers mindset, in agronomic terms but also in the attitude towards innovation (technological and social).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Central Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Roana. Asiago plateau is an area of 473 km2 on the Pre-Alp of Vicenza Province, between the rivers Brenta and Astico developing from 100 till 2341m on sea level, with an average hight of 1000m. It used to be an autonomous body (Reggenza dei sette Comuni). 90% of the surface is not private nor public property but belongs to the community. This results on one side as a great opportunity for collective and participatory environmental management, but, on the other side, it leads to an increased complication due to bureaucracy and the need of a longer decision making process. Its economy used to be based on agriculture but since the 900s tourism got an increasing share of relevance. The infrastructures (roads, railway and even a small airport) are quite developed and well functioning (thanks to the touristic activity). Despite a good economic development, population keeps on decreasing.   The size of the area (km2) is 78.13. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 850. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1300. The total population (in thousand) is 4.246. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 54.32. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -4.71%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 265.96. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.46%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18240. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 147726. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 22561. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 34742. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 30.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 67.60%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 4726. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 15.60%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 74884. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are not present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 56.60%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 33.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 63.60%.   1) commons innovative management (with involvement of a private company) to save them from abandonment or misuse. Private-public partnership; 2) introduction of new crops or heritage crops (largely abandoned) with new cultivation techniques and for new markets; 3) educational purposes towards residents and tourists; 4) social purposes in farming and as group of farmers and other actors (Biodistretto, organic district). Commons (= land not owned by any specific body, private or public, but belonging to the community) are often historical heritage of mountain areas communities, but in last decades not perceived as a value as their use is not as essential as it used to be. As a consequence they are often sold, abandoned or mismanaged, in any way the community dimension is lost. In this case a sort of private-public partnership is set up in order to reverse the loss of relevance and to regain the role of demo farm for local farmers, proposing them an innovative efficient management (not only for agriculture but for the whole value chain and its links with tourism) that can be exported and adapted to other local farms.   1. social and cultural: strong historical background of cooperation, still perceived and communicated as an asset; education role of the farm towards community and tourist (education as touristic attraction!); public-private partnership to manage commons. 2. environmental: acknowledged quality of the landscape; peculiar environments (pre-alps plateau).    1) sufficient social cohesion to bring forward the project in the long run (decreasing social capital); 2) depopulation; 3) loss of interest for agriculture, even if it is the basis for landscape maintenance, due to higher wages in other sectors. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The Asiago plateau is composed by 7 municipalities with a long historical tradition of cooperation ( in 1319 the world most ancient autonomous federation was set up here). They used to manage in a collaborative way also part of the land for pasture, crop cultivation and woods (in form of commons) and in the 900s they, as commons, set up a farm on more than 100ha, with stables for dairy cows and several buildings for milk processing and educational scope. The farm went than through decades of mismanagement and abandonment, since 2017, when the municipalities found an agreement with a large food industry (based in the area) and asked the entrepreneur to take up the farm and its management. Since then the farm was reoriented towards the production of organic vegetables, started an educational and leisure activities, got started with several innovation projects for local production of organic berries and nuts (previously well represented in the plateau but drastically reduced in area in last decades), beer production and other innovative value chains. The overall attempt is to use organic innovative value chains (not only the farming activity) for a better global management of the area, also using the prosperous tourism heading to the Asiago plateau, put at risk by climate change, as snow precipitation are strongly reduced, not allowing usual long skying seasons. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and vegetable, berries, hazelnuts, barley and hops for beer production..education and care farm. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Climate change is already and even more will, in short term, modify local touristic patterns and will make evident the need to look for different strategies to maintain the population in loco. Organic innovative farming, local value chain, multifunctionality of the farms are the key aspects the case. The area became an organic district (Biodistretto altipiano) and participate to the AIAB organic district network."
