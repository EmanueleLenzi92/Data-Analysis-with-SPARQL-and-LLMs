Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 FR. In Balagne, the revival is the result of the inhabitants often accompanied by local elected officials. This is the case of the village of Pigna, where the private initiative to plant gardens and orchards (citrus and fruit trees) is now that of the town hall.The construction of the value chain combines the search for additional income, food for residents, spatial planning, and tourist attractiveness.

The CV is based on the initiative of the village of Pigna located in a region of olive-growing tradition and revival of Perivillage areas (will of elected officials, associative dynamism). Perivillage productions brings together a set of inseparable market garden and fruit productions which derive their value from their geographical and social situation. The value of the products does not come from a reputation per se but from the conjunction of several resources adjusted to the food needs of the inhabitants (proximity, soil, irrigation, etc.). These foods, which are not only products, also occupy the strategic space around the mountain villages. They constitute a useful crown for occupation, spatial planning, firefighting and village sociability. These food areas also provide additional income and participate in the construction of the landscape. The value begins by taking into account local vulnerabilities and not the market opportunity. Just as resilience depends on local capacities to associate components such as spaces, knowledge (technical route for the production of vegetables and fruits), capacities and adjusted public action. The project is not only organized on a supply / demand connection but on a project of a mountain village community taking into account the food landscape of the village.   The conditions and challenges for relaunching perivillage fruit and vegetable production are: land release from agricultural terraces, the attractiveness of the activity (help with brush clearing, processing equipment jams, jars, dehydration), the promotion and sale of products as they are and processed, the organization of local networks which connect productions to local demand (culinary uses), in particular to collective catering. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Human abandonment has turned 'perivillage areas' into wilderness or areas occupied by stray animals. The current crises are leading to the beginning of the reoccupation of these spaces for the food production of the inhabitants. New species, varieties, new techniques, a new organization of trade is being put in place (permaculture, absence of pesticides, etc.). These social and technical innovations build new values (loans, hybridization, coexistence) based on a connection between inhabitants and their immediate environment. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are landscape of a mountainous village. The local assets include Social and cultural.   These social innovation around feeding is also encouraged by local mayors, regional authorities, and national ones through the implementation of public policies."
