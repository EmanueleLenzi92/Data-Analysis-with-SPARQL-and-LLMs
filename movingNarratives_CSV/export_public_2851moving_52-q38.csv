Il Pungiglione is a highly specialized centre in beekeeping and all its sectors: honey production, wax production, carpentry. They obtained the DOP recognition from the European Union, and they were the first in Italy to obtain this certificate. Il Pungiglione it is also a real village that welcome all disadvantaged people that have had difficult lives.   In Lunigiana, the low degree of industrialization, determines, an environment suitable for carrying out quality beekeeping. In the last ten years the POD Consortium have double the number of beekeeper in Lunigiana. Honey bees are crucial for maintaining biodiversity because they pollinate numerous plant species that require an obligatory pollinator for fertilisation and they are useful to maintain a diversificate landscape. The POD Honey production area done in a typically mountain landscape with a very varied vegetation with a particular diffusion acacia and chestnut.    They have some occupational therapy laboratories were, following the BIO disciplinary, high quality honey products are made, in fact in 2004 they received the DOP recognition for some of them, and also they create occupational paths for people that have lived dramatic experiences like detention or slavery for prostitution, making this reality an important social cooperative. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Pungiglione is a social cooperative that works in the organic field all bees products. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are All the land uses are used by bees to produce honey. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
