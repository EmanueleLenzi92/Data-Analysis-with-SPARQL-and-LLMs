In the Cretan delicatessen, a series of traditional edible products can be distinguished due to their taste and the nutritional value. A local women cooperative in the area of Gergeri produces successfully such products for more than 20 years. The products are strongly connected with the area due to the land morphology and the high quality of the local raw materials. Gergeri is located 40 kilometers southwest of Heraklion, in the eastern slopes of Psiloritis mountain. Besides the innovative products, the women's cooperative of Gergeri produces a wide variety of crackers, cookies, breadsticks as well as traditional Cretan pies and vegetable pies. The cooperative has modern facilities for the preparation, production and standardization of products and maintains a beautiful country tavern for hosting social events. Their products are sold through online stores. The set of activities of the cooperative contribute to the local SES. The raw materials and products used by the cooperative are provided mainly by the local natural resources, the grassland and natural land. The women's cooperative has an important impact for the area of Gergeri, as well as for every mountainous area in Crete, because it is a success story for the female and montainous entrepreneurship, adapted to the environment and the tradition. Most of their products have a reference to the Cretan cuisine and heritage. The women of the Cretan highlands have limited and difficult access to occupations other than farming activities in family level, which makes them completely dependent and deprives them of the prospect of personal and occupational choices. The majority of young women of the mountainous areas look for ways to leave their home villages, exacerbating the decline of the local population. Gergeri's women's cooperative is a successful example for tackling this social problem. The products they produce are of high quality, in close relation to the local raw materials and of high reputation in the Cretan market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous.
