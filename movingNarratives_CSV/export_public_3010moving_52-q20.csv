High quality product, which is part of the traditional Norwegian food culture. The VC continues in the region because the employees of the former cured meat company have continued with the business, adding new products and new marketing strategies. Mostly related to e-commerce.   The natural assets are the animals and also the mountain wind to cure the meat. The social asset relates to the regional brand as a way of cooperation among the producers. Finally, the cured meat is a traditional meal in the country and represents part of the food heritage.    1) Market competition with industrial meat corporations; 2) Abandonment of farms in the region that can affect the local supply of meat for transformation (in the municipality of Oppdal 40% of the farms stoped their activity between 1999 and 2014). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation relates to e-commerce marketing and the participation in regional brands. The case here described is part of Oppdal Smak av Fjeld but in Norway these kind of regional labels and producers' associations seem quite common. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland and Mountain wind. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
