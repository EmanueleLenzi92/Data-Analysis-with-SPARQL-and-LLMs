Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 38 CH2. The value chain consists of a beekeeper who produces and markets his honey locally, in small local shops and sells it online. The honeys also go through a certification process as they are certified with two labels: 'Miel du Pays de Vaud' and 'produit des parcs suisse'.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is L'Isle; L'Abbaye; Le Chenit; Le Lieu. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 17.98.

High quality product, labelled 'Miel du Pays de Vaud' and 'produit des parcs suisse', which guarantees origin, high quality and respect for the environment and animal ethics. The producers offers a new service (beehive sponsoring) to sensitize the consummer to the importance of bees and help him finance his production.   Production is mainly based on the natural assets (flowers, trees, etc.) surrounding the hives.    As the production is done in transhumance, there are challenges linked to the plains and challenges linked to the mountain regions. On the plains, the aim is to have an abundance of flowers and good biodiversity and little or no phytosanitary treatment by farmers or individuals (not too close to conventional field crops). In the mountains, the limiting factors are related to the cold, which requires transhumance. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. In addition to the production of artisanal honey, the producer proposes to sponsor beehives to make consumers aware of the importance of bees and to provide an additional income. The innovation is related to The producers offer a new service (beehive sponsoring) to sensitize the consummer to the importance of bees and help him finance his production. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural."
