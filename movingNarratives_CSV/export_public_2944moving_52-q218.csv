Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 RO. The main actors in the ecotourism value chain of the Piatra Craiului National Park are local business and residents providing accommodation, local food and meals, guiding services and rental facilities (notably mountain bikes). The area has been an official ecotourism destination in Romania since 2014 certified by the Association of Ecotourism in Romania (AER). AER aims to improve the quality of ecotourism services and to develop the infrastructure from ecotourism destinations across the whole of Romania. It is a membership organisation and works to bring together the public and private sectors in innovative ways to create partnerships for nature conservation and sustainable tourism development. AER operates an Ecotourism Certification System for putting into practice clearly-defined ecotourism principles.

The Piatra Craiului National Park is a high quality tourist destination in Romania, but also a fragile landscape and vulnerable ecosystem that is under great pressure from innappropriate development. Certified ecotourism is an innovative form of tourism very well-suited to the sustainable development of the local area. The concept of ecotourism is highly relevant for the mountain areas of Romania. It is a well-established concept in the international tourist market and is being effectively adapted to the Romanian context. The governance of this new sector by the Association of Ecotourism in Romania (AER) is also particularly interesting. AER has 56 members - most of them small tourism businesses, such as guesthouses or tourism agencies specialized in outdoor programmes and rural culture - and all having representation in the decision-making processes of AER, including the on-going development of the certification system operated by the association.   Piatra Craiului is a mountain massif that is widely considered a jewel in the crown of the Romanian Carpathians. Land use is a combination of traditional semi-subsistence pastoralism and deciduous forest, but the landscape is dominated by a 25 km long limestone ridge (highest elevation is 2,238 metres) with deep gorges and caves. This creates a unique mountain landscape that is highly appreciated nationally and internationally. Foor example, the 2003 movie Cold Mountain was filmed in and around the 'Prăpăstiile Zărneștilor' gorge which is is one of the most visited sights in the massif.    Rural tourism is very well-established in and around the Piatra Craiului National Park and the region has been a touristic hot-spot since the previous communist period. The National Park alone attracts over 110,000 visitors per year and this has put considerable pressure upon the local environment. These pressures are likely to increase and there is an urgent need to develop more sustainable, lower impacts forms of tourism whilst also maintaining the valuable income provided for the local community. There are also specific challenges associated with climate change, notably the increasing vulnerability of the domestic water supply due to over-exploitation by tourism combined with the increasing frequency of drought. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The concept of ecotourism has emerged more recently in the area to cater for tourists wishing to experience the natural environment of the National Park more responsibly without damaging it or disturbing its habitats as well as supporting the well-being of local people. The ecotourism services that are offered locally in partnership with the National Park Authority and local businesses are fully certified (by AER see below) and include: 'Eco-tours' with experienced local guides to visit wolf, lynx and bear tracks; Specialist hiking trips for nature photography; Low impact mountain biking trails, and; Small scale-accommodation structures (eco-lodges and guesthouses). The innovation is related to New products and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The touristic destination associated with the Piatra Craiului National Park encompasses a total of six LAUs: Oraş Zărneşti (40492), Moeciu (41471) and Bran (40633) in Braşov county (RO122) plus Rucăr (18527), Dragoslavele (16472) and Dâmbovicioara (16329) in Argeş county (RO311)."
