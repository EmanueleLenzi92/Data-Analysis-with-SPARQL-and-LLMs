Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 BG. Most commonly made from sheep, cow or goat milk, or sometimes a mixture of these. Varying degrees of ageing. Most farmers do not have a problem with selling their products locally, but the price tends to be relatively low and income is often limited because of the small-scale of production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Chiprovtsi Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes. Chiprovtsi is a small municipality close to the Bulgarian border with Serbia. The altitude is around 500 metres and the region is dominated by small-scale mixed farming (subsistence and semi-subsistence). The main land use is extensively grazed pastures and meadows (many of which are public) with some plots of cultivated arable land and many traditional orchards.   The size of the area (km2) is 286.9. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 3.139. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 10.94. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 39.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.19%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 4600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 524. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 13.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3402. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1497. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 18.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 19010. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 27.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.50%.   Traditional salted white cheese that is very characteristic of the Balkan mountains. Widepread traditional mountain product in Bulgaria. Similar to Greek 'feta'.   The natural assets used are the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) of the region. Many of these are publically-owned and were historically used as common grasslands under the control of the local municipality. After Bulgaria joined the EU and CAP Pillar I support payments were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    For very traditional products, like 'Sirene' cheese, that are produced by small-scale farmers the main challenge is how to 'add value' to the product in order to increase farm / household income. This is a particular problem in locations such as Chiprovtsi Municipality where a) infrastucture is poor and the opportunity to regularly visit organised farmers' markets in the main cities is very limited; b) there is a lack of commercial processing units to produce higher quality products; c) knowledge of direct marketing is limited, and; d) there is no regional brand - or 'mountain products' brand (see below). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
