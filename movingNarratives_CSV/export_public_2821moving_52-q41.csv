Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 GR. The VC engages the local producers and their families, due to the traditional scheme of cultivatrion. There is one cooperative of all producers, responsible for the quality standards of cultivation. There are a few firms which undertake the packaging, handling and marketing. Because of the traditional character of the product and the cultivation, the legumes are envolved in local catering services and activities of local cultural collectives. The quality of the products has drawn the attention of the munucipal administration and has brought about the interest of the Greek market and gastronomy. Local legumes are also studied in research projects for their resiliense in climatic change and their low carbon footprint. The reference mountain chain of this VC is HELMOS / KILLINI (ZIRIA). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is KORINTHIA. Feneos Plateau is surrounded by the mountains Ziria 2374m, Chelmos (Aroania) 2355m, Oligyrtos 1935m and Saitas 1697m. Between 800 m and 1,800 m the mountains covered with pine forests. The higher areas consist of grasslands and barren rock.

In the plateau of Feneos, at an altitude of 900m in the north-easter Peloponnese, the technique of growing legumes is traditional: sowing, carving, tying plants, harvesting, cleaning, packaging, are done by hand, as decades ago. In the 19th century the lake that covered the plateau was dried up, and the cultivation of legumes began. The soils and microclimate of the area are considered ideal for growing legumes. These conditions and the traditional knowledge are crucial for the quality of legumes. Feneou vanilla beans and Feneou fava beans have been identified as PGI products due to the ability of producers to discern the exact time stage when the pods are ready for harvest, making the products of high nutritional value. The products, marketed either by the farmers themselves, or by small local firms or by the local cooperative, have gained fame and recognition. High quality product, high reputation product, territorial identity, cultural identity. The product exibits excellent drought resistance, minimal fertilization requirements, limited need for plant protection. A cooperative with extensive participation is responsible for the self-produced seeds, the cultivation and the processing. It is part of the cultural heritage and the gastronomy of the area. It has gain fame all over Greece, which has extented the VC outside the area of Feneos.   The picturesque landscape of the plateau provides ideal climatic conditons and soil composition. Legumes are cultivated in the area for centuries and traditional knowledge has been developed. The farmers are organized in a cooperative which strenghrens the social interconnections and the sense of cooperation. The cooperation has undertaken actions towards standardization and marketing. The legumes are part of the cultural heritage and the gastronomy of the area. Nowadays the legume products are also sold in local festivals, and legumes are offered in religious festivities, in celebrations of joy or in ceremonies of sorrow in the villages of Feneos. The increasing interest of the product in the traditional Greek gastronomy has extented the VC beyond the limits of the area. Legumes seem to be quite resilient to clime change compare to other cultivated plants. There is also evidence that the cultivation of legumes, especially with traditional techniques, has a very small energy footprint. Additionally, the increasing demand of legumes and the high nutritional value, make the prospects of the VC very promising. Although the domestic market is in short supply in legume products, the production and marketing of Feneos legumes face challenges: low crop yield, competition from imported, lower cost / lower quality legume products, even adulteration threaten the cultivation in the area. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. An endogenious innovation is the knowledge capital in cultivation organically and by hand. During the last decade there is an exogenous innovation in marketig: the local farmers, aided by the municipality administration, have been trying to create a brandname for the legume products of the area and they have achieved the geographic indication (PGI) for two products (beans and yellow split pea) and they keep trying for more. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Similar VCs based on lagumes can be identified in Western Macedonia (MRL - NUTS3 : EL531, EL532, EL533)."
