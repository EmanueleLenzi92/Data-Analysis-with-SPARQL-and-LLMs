Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 UK. Although most forestry in Scotland is maintained/ managed for large-scale commercial or recreation use, there is a growing interest in artisinal/ bespoke wood products (using local wood) from local diversified farms and retail. Products include furniture, kitchen equipment, toys and jewellery. Within Ross and Cromarty there are several bespoke wood producers. Craobh handcrafted wood specialise in using local reclaimed timber. This family-run businesses received LEADER funding to help them expand. Meanwhile, Farmhouse furniture use local timber to create handmade wooden furniture and mantlepieces. There are additional ventures such as Black Isle wood turning which offer training on how to turn wood i.e. for cups and bowls etc. (this also uses local Ross and Cromarty timber). This VC requires good relations amongst the craftspeople, timber producers and land managers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ross and Cromarty. Ross and Cromarty is a region in the far north of Scotland. It is very remote from the largest cities in Scotland, but it does contain parts of the commuter belt to the city of Inverness and some small towns. Most people live in the lowlands and eastern coastal areas of the region. The uplands and west coast are very sparsely populated with spectacular scenery of mountains, moors, lochs and a rugged coastline.   The size of the area (km2) is 5202.051845. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -3. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1094. The total population (in thousand) is 55.581. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 10.68. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.44%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 22243.38. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2345.4. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 73.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8124. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 13.52%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 197. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.16%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.33%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 75.51%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   High quality and hand crafted timber products made using traditional (i.e. often by hand) means of production' Use of local (i.e., within the same LAU1) reclaimed timber to ensure short supply chains and a continued link to the area. Often there are clear attempts for sustainable practices given they use reclaimed timber (i.e., which may otherwise have been wasted) and work and sell locally.   Natural assets - reliant on timber which grows on shoulders of upland mountain areas. Also steady climate and maintained land use. Social assets: good relations amongst those in the VC including timber producer, land managers, bespoke carpenters and tourism busineeses. Cultural assets: traditional knowledge for traditional handcrafted timber production methods, and links to the cultural heritage of the area (i.e., knowledge of local trees and how best they can be used).    Less wood may be available for artisinal use given Scottish Government's desire to have more of the land covered in forestry (and reduce climate change impacts) in the future (21% forestry cover by 2032). Challenge of reduced tourist market due to BREXIT/ COVID. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. although this is a more niche value chain, artisinal timber products are not a new innovation. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is present across many LAU1s, especially those with prominent forestry cover such as Argyll and Bute (mainland) and Aberdeenshire. It is not always clear, however, the level of 'local' at which the timeber is sourced, and on occasions it is imported from outside of the UK. Much of the forested areas of Scotland are also in the lowland regions (i.e., not the Highlands and Islands area). Clear links between this VC and our forestry VC (VC 10 UK) in terms of competing/ complementary land use practices and the links with the Scottish Government's targets for forestry coverage by 2032."
