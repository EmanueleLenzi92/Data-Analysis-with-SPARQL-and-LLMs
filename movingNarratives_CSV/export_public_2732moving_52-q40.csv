Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 AT. The Murauer brewery is very engaged in sustainability effort within their own company but also to promote and increase regionality e.g. just as this VC description has been finished it was announced that the brewery supports the production of malting barley from the region with a long-term aim of sourcing the barley exclusively from Styria. They are not certified as organic, but have the products are certified with the Austrian Umweltzeichen , which is a government-awarded seal of approval for green business that identifies environmentally friendly products and services. The marketing is national and international via different channels. It is the first EMAS company in Austria and a Klimabündnis company (Klimabündnis is network of municipalities to support climate action; companies can also be certified). The production of its beer is carbon-neutral in balance sheet terms. The beer is however not organic. The brewery has 5 depots outside the MRL for their logistics: in Tamsweg (Lungau / Salzburg; neighbouring NUTS3 region to the west), Klagenfurt (Carinthia), Zeltweg (same NUTS3-region as the brewery, but to its east) and in Graz (the capital of Styria).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Murau (No: 614). The district of Murau is a peripheral region in the center of Austria north to Carinthia and east to the Lungau (a NUTS3 region in Salzburg, see VC of Lungauer Eachtlinge therefore next to the cold pole of Austria). The region can be considered as (very) peripheral (main roads are far away; the high-level rail link on the edge of the district will be lost in the next few years due to a new route). The river Mur (after which the region is named) flows through the main valley. The district of Murau is enclosed by the Niedere Tauern mountains in the north, the Seetaler Alps in the east and the Gurktaler Alps in the south and west. The lowest place is at an altitude of 650 m above sea level and the highest place 1,763 m above sea level. The highest elevation is at 2,740 m. The district of Murau is one of the most densely wooded areas in Styria, thus wood in general play a major role economically and thematically. The district has the largest closed stand of Swiss stone pines in Central Europe. The district also has an relatively small-scale industrial structure and has been scoring increasingly in the field of tourism for years.   The size of the area (km2) is 1385.4. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 650. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2740. The total population (in thousand) is 27.543. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 19.88. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.15%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21614.5. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2877. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.48%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.86%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 12940. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 8.32%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1613. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 82. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 7.87%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   Murauer is the biggest brewery in Austria which is organized as cooperative. The cooperative is an important company for the region, since, beside their 169 employees, they source their ingredients as regional as possible. The brewery has also some sustainability certificates. The Murauer beer is the flagship food production of the district/region Murau . Murauer provides a broad range of beer products, of which the main products (e. g. Märzen) are available at every supermarket and bars in Styria (and mostly also in other federal states) and special beer sorts (also wheat beer and alcohol free beer) are available in certain restaurants, supermarkets and shops as well as online. Additionally Murauer has an own lemonade production (name: Murelli ) with an increasing number of different tastes, which was in the beginning only available on tap, but meanwhile in bottles. Interestingly the price is very low (half the prize of a Coca Cola; at the same level as lemonades with the private labels of supermarkets).   Murauer is a very old beer brand, thus, the traditional brewing art is used for their marketing. The regional sourcing and engagement makes the brewery an important actor within the region, especially since this region is rather peripheral. The fresh water from the region is regarded as important asset for their product quality.    The brewery Murau has a well established value chain. A challenge might be the competition with other breweries, since Murauer is one of few bigger breweries in Austria that is still independent and does not part of to the Brauerei Union Österreich AG that belongs to Heineken. A second on-going challenge is to keep the water quality for the beer production which is of special importance because of their sustainability efforts and certificates. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The brewery s sustainability efforts in the production process can be seen as very innovative as well as their initiatives to source their ingredients as regional as possible. Like many other breweries Murauer also develops a range of products. It s also a sponsor of events and festivals in Styria (and beyond), where they also serve own lemonade. The brewery can also be visited in the Bierapotheke (which is a word play: Apotheke = pharmacy). The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Natural land and Natural water. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Beer is a traditional Austrian beverage being in the top 5 world wide regarding per capita consumption. Thus they are many small breweries producing traditional beer sorts, craftbeer etc. The marketing of the beer is mainly in Styria but the beer is available in nearly every supermarket nation-wide. In Austria there are only a few breweries that are cooperatives of which Murauer is the biggest one (employees, production scale) and maybe the most famous."
