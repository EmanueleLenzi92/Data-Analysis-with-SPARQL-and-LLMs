The promoters of 'Naturavicina' designed an ICT solution for consumers who want to buy organic products (vegetables and olive oil) rending a portion of land and participating remotely or in-person in the cultivation process. The vegetable products are grown in greenhouses, and the consumer can monitoring with cameras the state of the plants and irrigating the vegetable garden remotely. In the case of the olive grove, the consumer can decide if to carry out treatments, check the state of the plants and participate in-person to the harvest. Products are sent to costumes, and collective purchasing is suggested to reduce prices (e.g., solidarity purchase groups). To gain market share, 'Naturavicina' uses digital technologies that allow consumers to control and monitoring some agricultural activities. Also, a marketing strategy emphasises consumers' participation (who are a sort of 'prosumers') and organic production. In this sense, there is both a process and a marketing innovation.   In the VC, the territorial dimension is relevant in terms of the unspoilt countryside area where organic products are grown. In this scenario, a relevant aspect is the farmers' competence, which enables realising the purpose of 'Naturavicina'.    Increasing market competition by similar experiences can reduce the profitability of 'Naturavicina'. Moreover, organic productions and participation principle are stressed in 'Naturavicina', but the peculiarity of the territorial context is absent. For this reason, it can make the offer interesting but not unique for customers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. To gain market share, 'Naturavicina' uses digital technologies that allow consumers to control and monitoring some agricultural activities. Also, a marketing strategy emphasises consumers' participation (who are a sort of 'prosumers') and organic production. In this sense, there is both a process and a marketing innovation. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and farmers skills."
