Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 SER. The VC is dominated by the production of single dairy, Secondary dairy school in Pirot that is the guardian of the tradition and know how. There are around 13000 sheep produced by small scale farmers and the main milking season is May to October, while the rest of the year entails more use of cow milk in the cheese composition. The Dairy school is selling directly to consumers, through own shop to local market and through retail network. There is little readiness for further innovation in this moment, and the initiative to work on furhter quality distinction between PDO cheese are not taken yet.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia, Balkan mountains region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Balkan mountains. Pirot area is part of the of the Stara Planina National park and area of great natural value. Specific traits of traditional manufacturing of Pirot kachkaval derive from climatic conditions, characteristic grass habitat and the specific mountain region and milk from autochthonous populations (Pirot sheep). There is strong pressure of touristic investments and use of waterstreams that put pressures on enviornmental values. Traditinal know how and skills are embedded in the production process.

On of prominent GI products, using the original recipe which is more than two centuries old, skilled artisans make Pirotski kackavalj (Hard cheese from Pirot), a very famous Serbian delicacy. Pirotski kackavalj made it to the list of intangible cultural heritage of Serbia. Pure milk from Stara planina and salt are the basic ingredients. It holds reputation for its soft but recognisable taste deriving from the high quality mild from the mountain pastures, and aslo traditional manual process. The decline of livestock production makes it particulalry fragile when it comes to the quantities on the market and also know how. In the Serbian part of Balkan mountains, Stara planina mt. there is a long tradition of livestock sheep production. Products such as Pirot kackavalj (yellow mixed or sheep cheese) and Pirot lamb are hightly valued and recognized, and protected as PDO. However the region is under many threats from depopulation and economic deprivation to pressures from tourism and environmental degradation. The Pirot cheese PDO doesnt live to its potential of bringing benefits to producers which are often invisible. The pastoral lifestyle is becoming rare.   The natural properties of Stara planina natural park and its slopes and vicinity are initial condition for high quality product. Grazing areas, biodiversity and traditional know how are the strongest pillars for production of Pirot cheese. Social and cultural aspects are also strong, with particular equipemtn (weaving basket) used for cheese production. That made the whole cheese making skill part of the Serbian immaterial cultural heritage.    Depopulation and change of lifestyle from pasture grazing system to stationary are the main reasons for decline in number of sheep and milk shortage. There are 13760 sheep now, and the are the aging and uninhabited villages cannot sustain the needed production. Apart from these, the management of natural resources bocomes an issue with increased vulnerability and threat of investments in small hydro power plants that deprive population from fresh water and destroy watershead and scenary. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The VC is rather traditional with innovated marketing strategies and promoiton processes. The PDO registration is placed within Dairy secondary school in Pirot and that makes a good locus for spreading knowledge and know how. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The same cheese production is present in Bulgaria."
