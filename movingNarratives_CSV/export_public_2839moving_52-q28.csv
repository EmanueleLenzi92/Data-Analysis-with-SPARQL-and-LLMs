In the Bakony Mountains, there are many people involved in beekeeping, some who started it 50 years ago, some in recent years, migrating with the bees, following the blossoming of different plants and trees. These beekeepers are members of European Territorial Quality Mark Bakonyi Local Brand trademark. Their products are sold through short supply chains with some common design. They participate in a joint marketing system and are members of the European Territorial Quality Mark: Bakonyi Local Brand. It is also a quality assurance system and a marketing tool to promote products with a common logo. The trademark also creates cooperation between producers. They also produce special honey types: lavender honey, shallot honey, chestnut honey, hawthorn honeyf and special flavored honeys (walnut honey, hazelnut honey, herbal honey).   Very good condition and a long cultural tradition of honey production, large forested and agricultural areas. Good co-operation with agricultural producers (they are most happy to accept the bees on their land). Good connections with the local LEADER LAG, organising marketing and community action.    Mainly bee pests and diseases, as well as the effects of climate change, are also causing chemical treatments associated with industrial crop production. Fewer and fewer people choose beekeeping as a profession. For big companies honey can be sold at low prices, but a lot of energy needs to be invested in short supply chains. Many of the beekeepers are ageing, they stop selling in small scale and they often do not have anyone to pass the profession (and their bees) on. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Honey itself is considered traditional in this field, but demanding packaging, quality, and often online sales through a short supply chain are considered innovative. Many of the beekeepers are locals, but others are lifestile entrepreneur incommers, bringing new knowledge, technology, etc. to the common pool. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, grassland and forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
