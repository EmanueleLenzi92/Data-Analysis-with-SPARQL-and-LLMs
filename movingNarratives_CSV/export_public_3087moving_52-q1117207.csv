Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 27 ES. To be labelled as PDO Los Pedroches, the pigs must be at least 75% Iberian breed and must graze extensively in the dehesa within the area of Los Pedroches with a maximum density of 12 pigs per hectare. There are three types of labels (black, red, and green), indicating the % of Iberian breed (75% or 100%) and the type of feeding (acornes/natural pastures or cereals/legums). Being completelly embedded in the High Nature Value (HNV) dehesa ecosytem, the quality of the final product depends on the wellbeing of the landscape.

High quality product with great embeddedness in the dehesa social-ecological-system. The PDO represents quality assurance and territorial identity of the product. The iberian ham is one of the significant traditional food products nationwide. This VC is a key element for the sustainability of dehesa ecosystem. . E-commerce and processing plants to enhance their marketing strategies and to access the international markets.   1) Increasing the recognition of the Spanish Iberian ham, and positioning it on international markets 2) High density of animals in some farms that may harm the dehesa ecosystem 3) Fungus Phytophthora that attacks holm and cork oaks, which are the two main tree species in the dehesa ecosystem 4) Digitalisation, from the use of remote sensors to control the number of animals (carrying capacity) to infrared systems to guarantee the origin and quality level of the product (cebo, recebo, acorn). Digitalisation can play a fundamental role in controlling the traceability of the product as a guarantee of its quality. The sustainability of the dehesa, the basis of this value chain, is also supported by digitalisation, with early detection systems for pests and diseases or acorn harvesting forecasting based on remote sensors. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The main innovation of this VC is the use of e-commerce for their sales. In addition, they have one of the few meat processing plants that certifie to export to USA. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and Animal skin / leather. The local assets include Natural and cultural.
