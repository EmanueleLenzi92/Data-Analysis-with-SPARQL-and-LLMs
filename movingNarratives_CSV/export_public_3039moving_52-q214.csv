An innovative adaptation of game production during the Corona pandemic crisis. The aim is to sell more Slovak game meat to domestic consumers instead of a meat export to other countries. First, a web application was created for an e-commerce to connect verified hunters or sellers directly with consumers. The consumers can visit the webpage and check meat availability, choose meat type, locality and order the products online. Second, the Slovak governement implemented a project entitled 'Delicatess from the forest' with aim to promote game meat from the Slovak forests available on a domestic market and support collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Hunting is an important activity in Slovak mountain areas. The VC is a good example of market adaptation to the restrictions during a pandemic situation.   Natural assets are forests with wild game. Social asset is a collaboration between hunters, foresters, meat processors and traders. Cultural asset is a tradition of hunting in Slovak mountains.    1) Pandemic situation causes problems to game supplies. Retail chains require relatively large quantities of the same type of meat in a short time. As the game can only be hunted to a limited extent for pandemic measures, it isn't easy to ensure a sufficient amount of game and logistics to retail chains. 2) The government's implemented project is only temporal, and a long-term strategy to increase the amount of game meat available for domestic consumption is necessary. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation uses two forms of promotion of the product on the domestic market. One is a web application connecting directly hunters and consumers and the second is the government support for product's promotion and availability on domestic market. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and social.   This VC is relevant for all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
