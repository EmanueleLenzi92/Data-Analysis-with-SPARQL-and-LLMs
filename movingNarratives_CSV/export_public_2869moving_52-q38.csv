In 2020 the Docendo Discitur obtained the silver medal at the Cider World Award competition in Frankfurt (Germany) for the category Sparkling Cider Apfelschaumwein . In the same competition, the farm obtained in 2019 the second place. This farm is also partner of the network of agricultural producers called l Alveare che dice Sì that promotes local farmers with a fair and direct connection with costumers by a digital platform. Using apples for sparkling cider is quite an innovation in the sector and the SES. The e-commerce developed by l Alveare che dice Sì (for fair and sustainable agriculture) is an uncommon marketing strategy that offers higher commercial opportunity because it meets customers demand for quality, healthy, traditional and eco-sustainable products.   In the SES, apple cultivation is so common that they are one of the 'Traditional Agricultural Products' (TAP); apples characterize a large part of the SES landscape. Apples are also an element of the cultural and gastronomic tradition of the SES. The owner combined his professional and academic skills with the SES's territorial and socio-cultural features with product and marketing innovations.    Climate change can be a significant challenge for apple's biological cycles and drought, affecting the VC negatively. The cider market is a niche one, and to be competitive, product innovation and marketing strategy can be pivotal for success. For these reasons, scientific knowledge and traditional know-how need to be combined to develop intriguing novelties for the customers and market.
