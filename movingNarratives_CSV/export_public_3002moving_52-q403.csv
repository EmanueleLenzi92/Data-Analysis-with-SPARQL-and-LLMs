Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 SER. Donkeys are kept in natural environment, grazing in natural pastures, or fed with hay, with some addition of oat (when needed). Principles of organic production are applied. They are milked on a daily basis, and milk is directly cooled or freezes as fresh, in order to be able to transport it to the customers. Customers are buying it through ordering (social media or direct order). Surplus of donkey milk is used for soaps made of natural oils, medical herbs from the area and 20% of donkey milk. These soaps are sold through e-commerce or in direct selling in fairs, and specialised shops.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia - Stara planina (Old mountain) / Rodophy mountains,. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Old Mountain (Stara planina). Stara Planina is located in eastern Serbia, on the border with Bulgaria, and is part of the vast Balkans. As a morphological unit, it is bordered by the valleys of Beli and Trgoviški Timok, and Visočica, and in the east by the state border.This nature park is a treasury of sediments of different ages, from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic, documented faunistically and floristically, which is why the profiles or entire zones that represent the geoheritage of universal value have been singled out. The relief of the area is extremely morpho-hydrologically intersected, and numerous mountain streams enrich the landscape features. The presence of about 1,190 plant species has been determined on Stara Planina, which makes up 34% of the total flora of Serbia. In addition, it is one of the most important centers of tertiary and glacial endemic relict species. Numerous groups of animals that enrich and beautify this mountain are also represented. The research identified 116 species of diurnal butterflies, 18 species of amphibians and reptiles, 203 species of birds and more than 30 species of mammals. Stara Planina is, for example, the main habitat of red buzzard (Buteo rufinus) and field woodpecker (Alauda arvensis) in Serbia, the main habitat of forest snipe (Scolopax rusticola) in eastern Serbia and the habitat of the endemic Balkan subspecies of woodpecker (Eremophila alpestris balcanica). The peculiarity of the area is reflected in the exceptional richness of cultural and historical monuments dating from the pre-Christian period to the 19th century, among which numerous Serbian Orthodox churches stand out for their beauty.

Since 2005, in the area of Dimitrovgrad municipality (LAU1) some farmers started with breeding donkeys. They chose to keep Balkan donkey in order to preserve this autochthonous breed. Donkeys are kept for donkey milk that can be taken from the farm in fresh or frozen condition throughout the year. Since 2009 donkeys are kept according to the principles of organic production. They are primarily fed with grass/hay (grazing freely, or fed with hay in winter time. Occasionally they get oats in their diet. The farm is open for visits and there is a plan to incorporate this VC within rural tourism in near future. Besides donkeys, this farm is breeding other autochthonous breeds like Karakachan sheep, Balkan goat, Svrglji hens, and Karakachan dogs. Mission of this VC is to preserve endangered breeds, in the first place donkeys and to offer donkey milk as healthy and nutritious drink. Side products are soaps from donkey milk / containing 20% of donkey milk. Farm is buying donkeys from the whole Serbia and region in order to protect them and keep the breed alive. This VC is selected because it incorporates tradition of keeping donkeys with innovative products that are produced from the milk. Besides this, it serves to preservation of endangered breed Balkan donkey. Products are recognised as nutritious and healthy, while the whole VC provides additional value to the area which is depopulated, and is in danger of massive migration. Rural tourism paired with sustainable development and biodiversity protection is in the focus of this farmer and his cooperants.   The Old Mountain has been placed under protection, in order to preserve: exceptional value of flora and fauna, places that express exceptional geological diversity of the area, such as certain landforms, special occurrences of surface and groundwater and rock formations, beauty and diversity of landscapes, cultural values represented by medieval monasteries and other immovable cultural goods, objects of folk architecture, traditional tools, objects, occupations and customs of local population. Local food and food products play very significant role and represent valuable asset of cultural and gastronomy heritage of the area.    Old Mountain and Pirot district (especially Dimitrovgrad municipality / LAU1) are bordering region with Bulgaria, with very high level of depopulation. Many villages in the most beautiful parts of the mountains are becoming abandoned, or with few old inhabitants. The area is full of pastures, natural lands; different types of herbs (good for free grazing) and water, therefore, animals are kept most of the year outside, in free grazing. Donkeys, as well as other autochthonous breeds of cattle (Busha), sheep and goats, as well as wild horses are of interest of few dedicated farmers and their families, who are dedicated to their preservation, and to enlargement of their numbers. The area characteristics are favourable for organic production, but there are few certified organic producers, due to high expenses of certification. Nevertheless, many farms are following all principles of organic production. Demographics of the area is very negative, many villages are with only few old people still living there, while young people move to Pirot and/or bigger Serbian cities. Growing interest for rural tourism should be carefully directed towards sustainable development. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Donkey milk is a high quality product, but it is not very often used due to very low quantities of milk per animal. Balkan donkey was present in the area for long time, but during last decades, donkey became obsolete, and many donkeys were sold, or slaughtered for meat. This farm is buying donkeys from Serbia and from the region, bringing them to the donkey farm to continue their life in favourable environment, and to have better living conditions. Having milk sold as healthy drink, and making soaps from it, combined with medical herbs from the area, this farm started innovative process that serves to multiple purposes. They are also planning to incorporate the farm in rural tourism they will start soon. Currently, they organise tours for people to come, spend day in the farm, and see how donkeys live and are milked. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
