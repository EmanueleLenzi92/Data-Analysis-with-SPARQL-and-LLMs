Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 TR. The most common marketing channels used by apple farmers are brokers, traders, exporters and fruit juice companies. The supermarket retailers are used moderately in product sales. The direct to consumer sales are low. The prevalence of diseases and pests in the region reduces the quality of the product. Diseases and pests cause the appeal of the product to deteriorate. This negatively affects the demand of the product. The decrease in the market demand for the product causes the prices to decrease. The apple producers in the region do not have a farming organization. Despite these negativities, it can be considered as a positive development that the farmers continue to produce apples traditionally.

Social: Apples have been cultivated for a long time in Elmalı. 90% of apple growers are smallholder farms. Apples cultivation has been extended by community interactions. Cultural: Apples are traditionally produced in the Elmalı. For this reason, it fully fits the definition of cultural heritage. Apple cultivation is transferred from families to children as a cultural heritage.    The three most important challenges faced by producers in apple production are, respectively, the high number of diseases, the difficulty of finding market outlets and the high input costs. Due to the high number of diseases in apple cultivation, productivity is low. Climate change also has an effect on low productivity. Especially the negative impact of drought on apple production is mentioned. Since apple producers have problems in finding market outlets, the produced apple cannot be sold at high prices. In addition, it is emphasized that the family labour is insufficient in apple producing family farms. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   One of the value chains that includes Apple is available in Switzerland's MRL. However, apple value chain in Turkey differs from the value chain in Switzerland. The value chain in Switzerland includes the preservation and promotion of old high-stemmed apple varieties. Apple value chain in Turkey includes traditional apple cultivation."
