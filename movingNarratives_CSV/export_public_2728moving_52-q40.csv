Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 AT. Four fish farmers have teamed up and value solidarity-based cooperation. One farm breeds the fish from the egg and supplies the other farms with seedlings. One does not market the fish, but supplies the others. The others sell the fish directly to consumers, gastronomy and retailers. One of these two farms also runs a restaurant, sells processed fish products (e.g. smoking), and offers educational events about fish.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Weiz (No: 617). The region Almenland (transl.: Styrian alpine pasture region) is one of the biggest connected pasture-regions in Europe (total 125 pastures, 36,6 km2). The pasture are between 1.200 and 1.500 m above sea level. The climate is characterized as humid, having a lot of thunderstorms. The rock formation is diverse, primarily limestone, further: phyllite, slate and greywacke.   The size of the area (km2) is 1098. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 464. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1720. The total population (in thousand) is 90.654. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 82.56. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.68%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21444. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8141. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.77%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.50%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.73%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 4310. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.77%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4555. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 30. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 58.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%.

The Almenland Fish (trout and char) is a high quality product, which is marketed under the Almenland brand and MSC certified. The Stocking fish come exclusively from certified pond farms in Styria. They are used with a weight of approx. 10 days / piece. This means that the Almenland fish spends most of its life in the pure Almenland waters. He is fed with a GMO-free quality feed, and sold at an age of 24-36 months. The fish is exclusively raised by certified pond owners from the Almenland Nature Park in fresh spring water (8-14 C water temperature). The slow growth is ensuring high quality, GMO-free feeding, controlled by the animal health service. The initiative responds to the increasing demand for a product, and in order to be able to offer high quality products, farmers cooperate.   The fish represents a product, which fits well into the regional development initiative of Almenland 'region of culinary delight').    As cold-blooded animals, fish are particularly susceptible to changes in their ambient temperature. Particularly cold stenothermic species, i.e. fish species that are difficult to deal with increases in temperature, are affected by global warming and highly vulnerable. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Fish farming is not usual for the region, and responds to the increasing demand for domestic freshwater fish. Four fish farmers have teamed up and value solidarity-based cooperation. One farm breeds the fish from the egg and supplies the other farms with seedlings. One does not market the fish, but supplies the others. The others sell the fish directly to consumers, gastronomy and retailers. One of these two farms also runs a restaurant, sells processed fish products (e.g. smoking), and offers educational events about fish. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are fish farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   'Almenland Fish' is not a traditional Austrian food, however important for the Almenland region. In Austria there are other regions in Austria, where the fish is the lead product of a 'Genussregion' (without begin a traditional Austrian food; Genussregion = region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). In five other regions the fish is both classified as traditional Austrian food and marketed via a Genussregion: Kärntna Låxn (lake trout), Ausseerland Seesaiblinge (artic char), Mattigtal Forelle (trout), Salzkammergut Reinanken (coregonus = salmon) and Ybbstal Forelle (trout). In addition there are 3 other regions (total 8), where the fish is only classified as traditional Austrian food (without being a Genussregion): Neusiedlersee Fisch (fish from lake Neusiedl), Steirisches Teichland - Karpfen (carp from the region 'Styrian pondland'), Waldviertler Karpfen (carp from the region 'Waldviertel'). Another four fish varieties are nation-wide classified as traditional food: trout, common carp, coregonus (salmon) and artic char."
