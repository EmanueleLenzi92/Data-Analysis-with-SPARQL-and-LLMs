Mountain regions are home for wild animals that are hunted for meat. The VC utilizes the natural assets of the area - wild animals such as wild boar, deer, pheasant, hare. The animals are hunted members of the hunters associations and marketed to consumers.   The VC directly utilizes natural assets. It is a specific asset that can compete with meat products produced by conventional live stock farms.    VC is often in conflict with agricultural production. Proliferation of the wild animals results in damages on crops. The VC attempts to deliver products to mainstream consumers by developing new marketing chanels. One of the key challenges for the VC is to establish trust with consumers. Meat needs to be tested, consumers need to have knowledge how to process the meat, since it is a less known food product. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   The VC is very likely to be present also in neighboring countries (Poland, Germany, Austria)."
