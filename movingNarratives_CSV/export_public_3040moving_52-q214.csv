The VC describes popular public activity in Slovak forests relating to mushroom picking for own domestic use. Commercialization of mushrooms and forest fruits is not usual in Slovakia. Some informal selling occurs from individual collectors contributing to family livelihood. A webpage for collectors exists where people can share the actual place of mushrooms grows and their experiences. Collection of forest mushrooms and forest fruits by public is very common activity in Slovak mountain forests.   Natural assets are forests. Cultural assests are traditional activity in forest and knowledge about edible mushroom species.    1) the collectors are not always aware of restrictions for plant collection in National Parcs and National Natural Reserves. 2) no rules about the amount of mushrooms and forest fruits that individuals can collect. 3) the knowledge needed from collectors to recognize edible mushrooms and fruits. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   It is practically present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
