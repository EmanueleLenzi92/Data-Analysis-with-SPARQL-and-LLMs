Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 48 IT. The 'Latte del Parco' farm is strongly linked to the natural and cultural context of the mountains (i.e. the SES) for its natural resources (e.g. mountain pastures) and cultural aspects (mountain milk production, cheeses, etc.). VC intersects different sectors but not different SES. It has some certifications that attest to its mountain productions. The farmer collaborates with the nature park authority by being one of the Info Points for tourists. 'Latte del Parco' also has relations with schools in the area (educational workshops). The VC has positive impacts on the SES, but not collaboration with other breeders is reported.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Alps - Vicentine Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Bosco Chiesanuova. Bosco Chiesanuova is a municipality in Verona's Province in the Italian region Veneto, located about 140 Km West of Venice and about 31 Km North of chief city Verona to the borders with Trento province. It represents the first ski centre of the Lessinia plateau, where winter sports can be practised. Here is also spoken the Cimbrian language (German idiom).   The size of the area (km2) is 64.81. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 419. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1865. The total population (in thousand) is 3.531.

The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 3.44%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 25.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 70.95%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 33200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 146253.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.18%.

The farmer produces milk, dairy products (from cheese to yoghurt) and confectionery (e.g. parfaits and ice cream) in the 'Lessinia' regional park, in a mountainous area. Cows are for seven months in open-air grazing. The production is certificated 'mountain product' (MP) and labelled as 'Product in the Lessinia Regional Park'. In the farm shop, there is an area equipped with benches and a play area for children. The farm shop is also a tourist info point for the nature park. The farmer organizes educational workshops for schools. This VC is strictly linked to the natural settings of SES and its cultural dairy tradition. New productions related to the farm's milk are proposed (like ice creams) and information services on the park, too. The 'Latte del Parco' farm emphasises the authenticity, traditionality and naturalness of its products. However, this marketing strategy is not particularly stressed.   The farm uses the pastureland in the park for seven months and uses the natural and cultural landscape to distinguishing its production.    The VC intersects different sectors (i.e., confectionery) to enhance the milk and the naturalistic context. The complexity of productions and services could make the VC less competitive because milk and cheese are not certified as organic. More over, the production's territorial and historical identification is reported in a limited way. 'Latte del Parco' does not use all the potentialities of e-commerce. No links with other breeders are reported. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The VC includes several processed products beyond the local dairy tradition (such as ice creams and parfaits from farm milk), and the farmer offers informative tourist services. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
