Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 AT. There is no central actor for the fishing in Ausseerland. However, the fish is marketed via the Federal Forests a federal organization that manages wood lands and lakes in Austria as well as since 2018 via the fishery Ausseerland which continues the tradition of catching char and trout from wild populations at lake Grundl. This fishery combines old expertise and tradition with the latest technology and innovative methods. There is a cooperation of this fishery with two professional fishermen of the Federal Forests who catch several fish from the lake Grundl, lake Toplitz and lake Hallstatt which is marketed as wild fish. The fish is marketed as fresh fish (put on ice) or smoked fish directly to the regional gastronomy and to consumers. Especially in the management of the lakes, the issue of sustainability plays an essential role. The demand for domestic wild-caught fish far exceeds the supply. Nevertheless, the lakes are fished according to a strict management plan in order to still find enough fish in the lakes in the future. The closed season begins in mid-September and lasts until mid-March.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Liezen (No: 612 = NUTS3: AT 222). The Ausseerland region is situated at an altitude between 650 and 2000 meters above sea level in the geographical heart of Austria. The landscape is characterized by the highest mountain of Styria and several crystal-clear lakes. The climate is alpine with short summers and long winters. Precipitation is high. The Arctic char are native to the lake Altaussee, lake Grundl, lake Toplitz and lake Kammer - all between 700 and 720 meters above sea level. The fish also lives in small mountain lakes at an altitude between 1500 and 1600 meters above sea level. All lakes are characterized by excellent drinking water quality, which benefits char, which have high demands on water quality.   The size of the area (km2) is 3318.7.

Fishing in this area happens since the Neolithic Age and Bronze Age due to the salt mining in Hallstadt. Since the 13th century there has been professional fishing in this region. The fish was delivered to the imperial court in Vienna and the temporal imperial court in Graz. Fishing rights for the lake Altaussee were always in private hands, while those for the lake Grundl were exercised by the aristocracy and nowadays by the Austrian Federal Forests. Since 2005 this VC is embedded in a Genussregion ( region of local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria), which means that the Aussserland Seesaibling (artic char) and Ausserland Forelle (trout) are a regional high quality product. The fishing in Ausserland has a long tradition. A recent actor since 2018 is the Ausserland Fishery. The processing facility was completely renewed in 2020 according to the highest quality standards and hygiene regulations. Smoking of the fish is also carried out using state-of-the-art technology. The Genussregion itself is not a central actors compared to other regions using the concept of Genussregionen. The fish (of this VC) is basically available as fresh and smoked fish only in the region. Therefore tourism plays a central role in this VC.   Fishing in this region has a very long tradition. Still, the fishing methods are traditional, but combined with state-of-the-art technique. To secure the fish population the closed season is taken very seriously and therefore this VC focuses on quality, not on quantity. Since the fish is only marketed only within the region, spring and summer tourism plays a central role. In this regard Hallstatt and the commodification of its history (especially Asian tourists) is a main part of the tourism in the region and thus for this VC. The 'crystal clear' water from one of the high mountain regions in Austria is also part of the marketing communication.    Arctic chars love water temperatures just above to the freezing point and are very sensitive to higher temperatures. This is a thread in the context of climate change. About a decade ago, the number of char in the lakes declined drastically. This was due to the introduction of river perch and their rapid reproduction, as well as an overstocking of pike. Various methods were used to restore the balance of the lakes. The spawn of perch was removed using spruce branches as traps and pike were targeted. In addition, the catch of char was drastically reduced. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The fish is mainly marketed as fresh or smoked fish within the region. Because of the closed season between mid of September until mid of March this char is a seasonal product to ensure a sustainable management of fish in the lakes (sustaining the fish population), although the demand for the fish far exceeds this seasonal availability. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are lakes. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Ausseerland Artic Char or Trouts are not a traditional Austrian food, however the lead product of the like-named Genussregion, although in contrast to many other regions of thistype, there's no central actor or cooperation among those concerned in the VC. In Austria there are also other regions in Austria, where the fish is the lead product of a 'Genussregion' (without begin a traditional Austrian food). In five other regions the fish is both classified as traditional Austrian food and marketed via a Genussregion: Kärntna Låxn (lake trout), Ausseerland Seesaiblinge (artic char), Mattigtal Forelle (trout), Salzkammergut Reinanken (coregonus = salmon) and Ybbstal Forelle (trout). In addition there are 3 other regions (total 8), where the fish is only classified as traditional Austrian food (without being a Genussregion): Neusiedlersee Fisch (fish from lake Neusiedl), Steirisches Teichland - Karpfen (carp from the region 'Styrian pondland'), Waldviertler Karpfen (carp from the region 'Waldviertel'). Another four fish varieties are nation-wide classified as traditional food: trout, common carp, coregonus (salmon) and artic char."
