Forest covers 37% of the territory of Bulgaria, of which 38% is timber producing and 62% is protective - notably for biodiversity. Forests are mainly owned by state enterprises. The South-Central State Enterprise - Smolyan - was registered in 2011 and manages 717,192 ha of state-owned forest (83% of total) in four districts. The forset stand is predominantly coniferous (55% pine and spruce) with altitude from 100 - 2,198 metres and 60% designated as Natura 2000. The Bulgarian forest sector has developed rapidly in recent years with growing timber production and stock, increased forest certification, introduction of more efficient and transparent trade mechanisms (electronic public timber tenders) and reforms addressing illegal logging and improving timber traceability. Around 20% of forest land is FSC-certified and likely to increase more due to the strong export orientation of the timber processing and manufacturing sector.   N/A.
