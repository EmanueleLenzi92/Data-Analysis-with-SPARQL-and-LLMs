The 3500 altitude Etna volcan - sometimes in active eruption - attract great number of turists from all over the world. The local farmers were able to hook up on turism offering visitors a larger and more complete experience of discovery of the territory and its productions.

This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The main original innovation was the deepen understand of the agronomical traits of the main local variety Nerello Mascarese, and its adaptation to volcanic soils and mountain climate, thanks to the knowledge brought by the experienced wineries from outside the region. Later, the use of oak wood casks for Nerello fining, was optimzing the intrinsec quality of the red wines. In the last 15 years took place an increasing adoption of organic, biodynamic, natural, and quantic standards for production. An active consortium Vini Etna DOC and an institutional Enoteca Regionale, respectively for control of origin and typicity and for promotion of the appalletion wine, synergically support the marketing activities of the private enterprises. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Natural land and olive trees (local variety biancolillo), hazelnut, pistachio, saffron. The local assets include Natural."
