The same plant may have flower and fruit at the same time, because the flowering season begins when the fruits of the previous year are ripe. Fruit production may be quite irregular among years.    Will climate change affect strawberry trees distribution and Strawberry tree fruit quality?. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.
