Gwent Valley (or Blaenau Gwent in Welsh) (LAU1) Beeswax products include candles, soaps, other beauty products and reusable food wraps (i.e., instead of cling film). Honey Bee Beautiful for instance is a sustainable honey and beeswax skincare business based in Gwent Valley. They only use raw Welsh Honey and Beeswax cappings.

Often these producers are linked to food and drink quality schemes (i.e. for their honey) and beekeepers associations. They are high reputation products given that they use pure raw local honey/ beeswax. The beeswax and wider honey products connect to the wider territorial identity of Southern Wales. Beeswax wraps raise awareness of single-use plastics and foodwaste. This innovation mainly relates to new products as they are making new products out of former waste (i.e. beeswax). Furthermore the increased interest in school visists/ education to beekeeping/ hives is another new innovative product. Although beeswax candles are not especially new, the moves into food wraps and skincare is particularly innovative.   Natural assets: relies on maintenance of ecosystem to ensure good quality and quantity of beeswax/ honey. Social assets are good relationships with the land owners and producers of beeswax products. Cultural assets and the use of traditional knowledge of beekeepinng practices and the importance of maintaining links to local Welsh identity and promoting Welsh honey/ beeswax products through education trips and visits.    Reliant on maintainence of the local ecosytem to ensure bees continue to produce good quantity and quality of beeswax/ honey. Potential difficulties in selling to their markets due to BREXIT/ COVID. Good relations with the local land managers needs to be maintained to ensure access to hives/ and good environment (i.e. pollinators). Also potential impacts of bee numbers/ wuality of honey from climate change. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Use of more-than honey products for candles, skincare, food wraps and education. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There are close links between the beeswax VC and the (heather) honey VC. Beeswax products are produced across the UK, especially in connection with honey production ventures."
