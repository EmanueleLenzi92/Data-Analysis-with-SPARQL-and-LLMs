Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 26 ES. Siete Valles de Montaña is the first cooperative of organic livestock farmers in Cantabria. United for four reasons: for animal welfare, for the consumer's health, to protect the environment, and to continue leading the life they have chosen. They belong to various valleys of Cantabria; some are third and fourth generations of farmers; others have only been living with the cows for three years, but they are all driven by the same interests: to create quality products, beneficial to health, with an authentic flavor, that protects the mountains, that keep the balance with nature, and that follow the SLOW philosophy. They have between 30 and 100 cows of the Charolais and Limousin breeds grazing extensively on their medium-sized farms. They offer different products (churrasco, entrecote, sirloin steak, minced meat) and lots that they serve at home all over Spain and sell in stores in Cantabria and Vizcaya.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cantabrian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Polaciones. The Polaciones valley consists of nine villages and three smaller population centers, it is the highest valley in Cantabria. It is a rugged area, with heights exceeding 2000 meters and the third-highest town in Cantabria: Cotillos. The high mountains are populated by forests, with species such as oak, beech, holly, or birch, and shrubs (genista, broom, blueberry). In the high zone, subalpine vegetation can be seen (junipers, rose hips, griñoleras). On the slopes and plains, there are meadows and farmland. In these mountains, wolves, chamois, deer, roe deer, and brown bears can be found, as well as wild boars. Among the birds, it is worth mentioning the griffon vulture and the golden eagle. Several of these species are protected, and hunting is prohibited. Those that are hunted can be hunted in one of the three big game hunting lots of the Saja Reserve.   The size of the area (km2) is 89.77. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 840. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2057. The total population (in thousand) is 0.221. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 2.46. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.11%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 109.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 12432.3. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 12432.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.62%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 28.22%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 70.16%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 12205. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 12432.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.62%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.22%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 70.16%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 60. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,08%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 54. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 94. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 25.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.20%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 25.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 72.20%.   Polaciones is a municipality traditionally dedicated to cattle breeding, particularly of the Tudanca breed and the Brown-Alpine breed. In the meadows, there are also horses without stables. Around 25% of the active population is still dedicated to the primary sector. A critical production is veal, the meat of cows or steers that have been reared for at least six months up to the time of slaughter. They collaborate with other producers in pioneering initiatives of proximity trade, environmentally and socially committed, as it is the case of 'El Super de Los Pastores,' the dream of 150 small local producers.   Thanks to grazing, the forests are kept free of fires, and the fields thrive. Animal welfare is fundamental in organic livestock farming, so it is extensive in order calves to be raised in semi-freedom, where they fatten up thanks to their mother's milk, pasture and organic cereals fodder.    The main challenge is to consolidate after four years of operation amid the current health and economic crisis, a short market channel offering the product directly to consumers or through highly specialized commercial channels committed to the same food production philosophy and consumption. Having social, regulatory, and public support for its contribution to sustainability and rural territories can be the counterpart that ensures its survival. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Being a traditional production system, it is worth highlighting essential aspects of innovation such as its certified organic production, cooperative structure, and direct marketing channels. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Other mountain regions in Europe know of similar initiatives in the cooperative articulation of organic meat producers who market in short channels."
