Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 ES. The Huesca small vineyards and cellars are all located in the higher part of the mountain and were progressively loosing economic relevance, with several cases of abandonment. At the same time, In last 50 years, winegrowers of a the lower area stared to cooperate and managed to have their tipicity acknowledged under the Somontano D.O. The Somontano production is heading to the provincial and regional market as well as to European and North American markets facing a good success. Somontano wine companies started to be interested in the Huesca vineyard and offered local vinegrowers their support,in the vineyard and in the cellar, bought their grapes or helped them processing them on site and promote the wines on the market. The interaction between professional wine grower in Samontano and the small-scale producers in Huesca is the key of the value chain success.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Spanish Pyrenees. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ayerbe. The Sierra Loarre is a mountainous formation in pre-Pirineos. close to France.in Aragon, in the center of Pirineos. This area produces excellent wines thanks to the genuine fruit of the nature of the grapes and its subsequent artisanal processing. The conditions are optimal to produce wines of extraordinary quality. Depopulation of higher areas is a main problem.   The size of the area (km2) is 63.89.

Due to depopulation in last half century, a lot of vineyards were uprooted and now what remains are small productions with identity value. The agro-ecological system is polyculture, each farmhouse in the area maintains a very small winery put at risk by aging of the farm population. In the last decade several professional farmers showed interest in getting engaged into the local highly identified production and offer their knowledge and support to local producers. There is a IGP (indication geographical protected) Ribera del Gállego-Cinco Villas. 1. the innovative and grass-root cooperation among professional Somontano producers and the small scale Huesca farms; 2. the need to regain old varieties, adapted to the extreme weather conditions; 3. the problematic grape growing with a proper ripening cycles due to climate change; 4. Recent introduction of new knowledge in vineyards, cellars and tourist activities, along with widespread organic production and online sales can be a game-change.   The pre-Pirineos (600-1000 m) area is close to high mountains and people from high mountains used to come to buy wine and exchange cheese, meat and other products. The same from France and from low lands, who exchanged fruits and vegetables. This region was named: 'Reino de los Mallos'(kingdom of rock mountains) and has 2000 years of history, as well as many Romanic churches, Falling in ruins in the last 30 years, due to depopulation and abandonment.    1) lack of small producers professionalism; 2) high production costs that can hamper market potentials; 3) Climate change is evident in the ripening cycles of the grapes. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Tradiotional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. 1. the changeover of most wineries to organic production; 2.the introduction of complementary activities (tourism, tastings, etc.). 3. the model of cooperation between Huesca small scale, non professional vine and wine producers and the professionals of Somontano. The innovation is related to New products New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and old, small and high parcels. They were vineyards, now there almonds or they are in fallow state. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Among Spanish wines, whose market and export has a very relevant role in the economy of the country, Aragon used to cover 30% of the whole National wine production. Nowadays wines from Aragon are less than 20% of the National production but this specialty mountain production can contribute to increase again the relevance of the region. Besides, the model of cooperation among high mountain vine-growers and other areas wine producers can be adapted to other areas."
