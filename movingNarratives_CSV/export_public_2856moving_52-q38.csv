Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 IT. The VC is not dependent on other SES for its production process, but it is strongly oriented towards the foreign market (90% of production). Relevant actors are sheep farmers who produce milk traditionally and sustainably and local institutions. The PDO (protected designation of origin) label is adopted for the 'Pecorino Romano' cheese.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sardinia Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Pattada. Pattada is a little municipality in the Province of Sassari in the Italian region of Sardinia (the second large island of Mediterranean sea). The town is located about 50 km Southeast of Sassari, the second large city if Sardinia. In the area of Pattada is peculiar for the production of Pecorino Romano DOP cheese and the surrounding countryside is largely pasture. Sheep are raised for milk, and the milk is made into cheese at the local cooperative company.   The size of the area (km2) is 164.88. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 221. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1093. The total population (in thousand) is 2.993. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 18.18. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -10.97%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 67.31. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.90%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 19300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 5732.4. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 3.24%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 12.77%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 83.98%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 31117. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.31%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 104. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.04%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 176. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 66. In this region protected areas are not present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.31%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.54%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 82.14%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 6.36%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.33%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 79.29%.   La Concordia uses only local sheep s milk produced in a sustainable way (organic milk) by 400 cooperative members. The cooperative company developed its production on the local tradition of dairy (the Pecorino Romano DOP cheese - protected designation of origin and other mountain cheeses) and traditional sheep farming (non-stall breeding). Notably, La Concordia exports to the US a large part of its Pecorino Romano DOP cheese. The collaboration between 400 sheep farmers to produce traditional local cheeses has been made possible thanks to a new form of governance for the social context of Northern Sardinia.   The local tradition of sheep farming has enabled the development of sustainable milk production. The common social culture between farmers and political-institutional actors allowed the realisation of the dairy.    Although La Concordia has a strong outlet market (mainly the United States), its productions seem to lack a more precise socio-cultural and environmental connotation. This situation may compromise its competitiveness in the medium term due to international concurrency. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. In the social context in which the 'La Concordia' dairy is developed, establishing a 'cooperative company' was a novelty for the sector. The market now appreciates traditional forms of milk production (mainly if made in a sustainable way) and peculiar local cheese. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
