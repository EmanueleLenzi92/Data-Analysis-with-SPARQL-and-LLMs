Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 FR1. Fruit with pips VC is representative of the North of Drome departement and plain regions. The VC is mainly represented by large conventionnal exploitation, processed by large cooperatives (Lorifruit, Rhodacoop ) and marketed in long distribution chains or export. However, one can also find organic production, more driven to valorisation in local markets. In general, this VC faces strong climatic pressures: more and more freezing episodes in the spring, water scarcity as well as invasion of disease and parasites. In order to adapt, some actors of this VC are trying to diversify their production and to developping more resistant varieties and more adapted productions: almonds, grenades, kiwi. These productions adapt better to high temperature and need less water.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Drome Valley. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Drome departement. Drôme is a very diversified departement in terms of geological, natural and agricultural resources. The North-East of the territory is characterised by middle and high mountains (Pre Alps and Vercors Natural Park): agriculture is this area is mainly livestock and small diversified gardening. The South is characterized by the beginning of the Provence and the mediterranean climate, we can find there aromatic and yard large cultures. The West of the territory is characterized by plains were the Rhône and the Drôme rivers meet. Agriculture ther is mainly large cropland. Within the Drôme departement, Biovallée territority gathers 3 associations of municipalities (EPCI) - 95 muncipalities in total. It is a very preserved and diversified territory, following the Drôme River, from Pre Alps to large plains of the downvalley.   The size of the area (km2) is 2200. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 50. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2453. The total population (in thousand) is 58.56. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.3. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.6%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 14532.49. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 20.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 77.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 32799. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 242040. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 24.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 74.30%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 56167. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 37%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 6400. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 115. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 24.60%.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.10%.   Fruit with pips is a representative production of north of the Drome. The main production are apple pear and also kiwi (minor in terms of volume). This VC is mainly represented by large conventional exploitation, tranformation by large cooperatives and driven to long chain distribution or export by marketers. However, some producers are diversifying and developping organic agriculture, with local processing and local distribution through direct sale and local market channels. New products: production of adapted variety or diversification with adapted cultures (almonds, grandes, kiwis ) New processes: conversion to organic production, introduction of practices to preserve biodiversity in orchard New marketing strategies: better local valorisation of organic production, sale in local market.   Natural asset: eastethic landscape Social asset: creation of local job and local value Cultural asset: contribution to Drome territorial identity, gastronomy and attractivness.    Fruit with pips production is treathen by freezing episode, disease and parasites. The current challenge is to find solutions to fight freezing episodes but also to diversify towards more adapted cultures and more resistant cultures. Due to the climatic crisis, the VC depends on regional public aids. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Fruit with pips producers are diversifying with new variety more adapted to current and predicted climatic conditions: almonds, grenade, kiwi. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
