Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 23 IT. the value chain pertains organic production of champenois wines by the Ferrari company. The company, historically based in Trento processes the grapes of their own farms, of about 300 small farmers of the area. About 5 years ago they funded a study on the impact of climate change on wine quality and on the basis of the outcome they decided to invest in an area that till now was not considered suitable for vineyards. The vineyard was planted and is now in production, still to be assessed the consequences of quality and the response to climate change (it needs longer periods).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Trento. Trento is the capital of Trentino Autonomous province. Its territory includes the city but also the surroundings, whose large part is mountains. Agriculture use to play an important role in the province but it is progressively abandoning higher areas (where traditionally animal husbandry was more common) and concentrate on plant production (grape, apples, berries, vegetables.). Tourism is very important and counts on the high environmental and landscape quality. The type of landscape is typically alpine but with the advantage of good infrastructures and a city in proximity.   The size of the area (km2) is 158. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 181. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2180. The total population (in thousand) is 120.64. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 764.15. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.40%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 79.11. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.84%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 23050. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 18734.7. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.34%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 72.70%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 18788. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 18788.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.34%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 22.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 72.70%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 3661. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 9.23%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 5962. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 20. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 25.29%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 70.20%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 25.29%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.20%.   1)it is based on a climate change forecast and a reaction to the need to find alternatives; 2) it is leaded by a large wine company who decided to invest in the local ecosystem: 3) it can be translated to other areas. 1) it is a case that shows how private companies can react to climate change, so transforming marginal mountain areas into valuable areas for the future; 2) it shows the potential of investments in local development in mountain areas, by a brand, for marketing strategies and diversification; 3) it shows the potential role of private companies.   1) valorization of areas considered as marginal and progressively abandoned. The investments for planting the vineyard changed the area and open up to the potential use for touristic activity. The company started also a restaurant and other PR initiatives in the area; 2) the are is not far from highly utilized locations and could be put into connection with them, for production purposes but also for touristic purposes.    1) cost of the whole operation and related economic sustainability;. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. the innovative aspects relate to the fact that vineyards have been planted at an altitude higher that usual, based on a previous study on climate change forecast, and to the fact that the whole management is organic. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and vineyards. The local assets include Natural.   Wine sector is concerned about climate change, both in terms of vineyards sustainability (increasing water needs, new pests and diseases.) and wine quality (maturation problems, different win characteristics etc.). As a consequence several trials are going on in wine regions to assess the potentials of going upwards with the vineyard cultivation and that could be a lever to regain to agriculture what are today considered marginal areas."
