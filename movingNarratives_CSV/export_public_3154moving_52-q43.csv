Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 TR. In the area 85 % of olives are used for olive oil production. Harvested period of the fruit is between mid-October and mid-February. Entrepreneurs in the traditional olive producing regions are either in the high end of the value chain i.e. people from big cities trying to enjoy country life and olive culture or the merchants creating and benefiting from scale economies by organizing small-scale producers and processors. Regarding value chain actors, the Sales Cooperative Unions Marmarabirlik and Tariş are both main big players in the sector.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Edremit, Balıkesir.

Olive trees, a special and valuable type, are grown in south part of Mount IDA which is convenient to climatic conditions. It takes its distinctive features from the geographical structure and climate of this region and its unique elements such as soil structure. North Aegean olive oils are high priced in the market due to their special organoleptic qualities. North Aegean olive oil is an aromatic virgin olive oil that has Geographical indication(GI). GIs are used for rural development (structuring of supply chain around product reputation, formation of stable and higher product prices, value creation in all stages of supply chain, improvement of regional tourism etc.) as well as preserving regional knowledge, knowhow and culture.   The Aegean region is an important area for olive production with the North and South Aegean regions producing around 60 65 % of the total amount of olive oil manufactured in Turkey. North Aegean olive oils obtained from Ayvalik cultivar have received the registered geographical indication. The unique climate and natural resources ensure in the region for olive trees development.    The sector faces challenges specific to agricultural and food sectors, such as climate change. High periodicity, high production costs, existence of informal olive oil production in the sector are the main problems. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The production of chestnut candy is done in a traditional way. But in the last years, chestnuts cultivation system was changed ( improvement of rural economy by leasing the bare-degraded (unproductive) forest and treasure land ). Most farmers abandon picking up chestnut naturally because of chestnut blight. Instead of picking up chestnuts in the forest, farmers have started to establish chestnut orchards. Marketing strategies are changed from traditional to modern ( e-commerce). The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Olive oil is included in other MRLs in the Member State such as France, Greece, Italy, Spain. Turkey is a significant producer in the world olive and olive oil sector. Turkey, compared to leader producer countries such as Spain and Italy, is at the low end of the global olive oil value chain with high share of bulk olive oil exports and low share of high value added, branded exports."
