The Gastro-village is successful area of rural tourism, mainly due to a few fine-dining restaurants, wineries, cafes, making the whole area very fashionable. The most interesting aspect is the Eat the View phenomena: The hype of the place , attracting most of the visitors, is created by the Gastro village , that, apart from being nested in the local landscape, has little to do with the locality. Thus, the Gastro-village is very relevant to land use, environment and local culture, and is also highly susceptible to demographic changes, overexploitation and climate change.

The Gastro village consists of a butique hotel with restaurant, two succesful restaurants,two wineries and an art galery/cafe. The restaurants use some local products and sell local wine. They have an organization for co-operating with each other, some common marketing, events, etc. This initiative has become one of the most successful rural tourism destinations in Hungary, however, it carries many conflicts, tentions, challenges. Using local products is a hard and innovative process, not many restaurants try to do so. Co-operation, joinded events amongst restaurants, wineries, etc. is a novelty. They also co-operate with the municipality, they invest into the infrastructure of the village (for example building a sidewalk) they aim for self governance. Social networks, ICT, etc are used for reaching customers.   The most interesting aspect is the Eat the View phenomena, that is:, the hype of the place , attracting most of the visitors, is created by the Gastro village , that, apart from being nested in the local landscape, has little to do with the locality.    Successful tourism creates serious local tensions. There is a fast grosing visitor pressure, local infrastructure cannot keep up, traffic pollution, etc. Indigenous local people gain little income from tourism business, most enterprises are owned by incomers. co-operation between restaurants and local food producers is difficult. There are split realities (economic, social, cultural) in the locality, bringing tension and challenges. Housprices skyrocketed, local people are being pushed out, land use systems are changing, agricultural production is diminishing. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. High quality accomodation, fine dining restaurants and wineries are uniqe in the area and in small villages in general. Using local products is also considered to be innovative. The innovation is exogenous, mostly people from the big cities maintain these places (some are not even living in the village). The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are The wineries use cropland for grapes, but the restaurants only use land in a figurative sense (through producers). The local assets include Natural and social."
