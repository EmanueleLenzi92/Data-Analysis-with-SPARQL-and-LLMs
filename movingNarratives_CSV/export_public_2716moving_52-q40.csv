Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 AT. 19 farms cultivate different varieties of potatoes and they do seed breeding as well. The potatoes are sold via a supermarket under the label Wir sind Steirer (trade mark owned by this supermarket), and they are marketed via various forms of direct sale (on-farm sale, online) being branded as Murbodner Erdäpfel . The compliance 'region of culinary delight' quality scheme is controlled by the AMA.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Murtal (No: 620). Murtal is a very young district that was created by merging two former districts. The district is named after the river Mur. The Mur valley is bordered in the north by the Niedere Tauern, by the Gurktaler Alps as well as the Styrian Randgebirge (Seetlaler Alpe, Stubalpe, Gleinalpe). The alpine to high alpine region is located in the western part of Upper Styria at an altitude between 800 and 2700 m above sea level. The region is characterised by a southern alpine climate. The valley areas show cold, continental weather with temperature inversions in winter and moderate temperatures in summer. Compared to the other landscapes of Styria, the Murtal is one of the landscapes with the lowest precipitation in Styria. The mountain flora is conditioned by the soil and climatic conditions and is characterised by a variety of alpine plants.   The size of the area (km2) is 1675.7. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 318. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2552. The total population (in thousand) is 71.698. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.79. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.01%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21614.5. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2877. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.48%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.86%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 34467. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 22.16%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1840. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 90. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 7.87%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   19 farms produce 7,000 tons of the highest quality potato and refined products. 89 communities in the upper Mur Valley are involved in the project. The initiative cultivates different varieties of potatoes and it also implies tuber conservation (seeds). The products are sold via a supermarket under the label Wir sind Steirer (trade mark owned by this supermarket), and they are marketed via various forms of direct sale being branded as Murbodner Erdäpfel ; the product placement was supported by the Agrictural Innovation Center (LIZ) from the region. The connection of the region and a specific food product offers a promising opportunity to better link the tourist sector, esp. gastronomy with local food products. In addition the 'Genussregion' is used as marketing strategy to gain higher value from a 'simple' product such as potatoes.   The 'region of culinary delight' does not only favour the potato producing sector, but promotes the whole region in terms of touristic attraction, which boosts the local economy. The cooperation of producers, traders, restaurateurs and tourism professionals to create a 'region of culinary delight' brings added value and reputation to the region.    Potatoes are among those crops that grow under inhospitable conditions and at high altitudes, and few crops provide a comparably high yield of nutrients per cultivated area. This is particularly important where land is scarce, like in mountainous areas. Although they are a labor-intensive crop, thanks to their high yield and usually good selling price, they can also be grown competitively by small farmers. However changing weather conditions might also affect the way of cultivating potatoes and the breeds used. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. A 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria) was set up in the context of the 'Murbodner Erdäpfel', which links tourism with potatoe products and festivals around that topic. The concept supports a region to be marketed together with its typical products or foods. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Cultural.   The cultivation of potatoes for the mass markets happens in the flat lands in Eastern and Southern Austria. There are few other mountain regions where the potato is cultivated and marketed as quality products (also in supermarkets) such as Lungauer Eachtlinge (see VC AT 12)."
