The initiative is implemented in a partnership with the active participation of local associations, external institutions (various universities), individuals and the local authority. Strengthening the community and making resilience, empowerment. The tool of gathering local agro-knowledge is to conduct interviews (with local seniors) - interest in them positively affects them and helps networking and embedding.

The VC adds the past to the present, explores, preserves, recreates and makes available knowledge of traditional agricultural technology and lifestyle for the present and future generations. The physical space uses past agro-knowledge to help sensitize and change attitudes to social and ecological problems. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
