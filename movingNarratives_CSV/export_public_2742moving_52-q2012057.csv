Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 BG. Linbul Farm (https://petrohan.wordpress.com/) is an innovative farm enterprise in the Petrohan area of in the Berkovitsa Municipality (MON02) in Montana Province (BG312). Average altitude is approximately 1,400 metres and the farm manages 40 hectares of rough upland pastures with 60 suckler beef cows. The pastures are High Nature Value (HNV) and rented from the municipality. The farm has applied for - and has been receiving - both agri-environment and Natura 2000 payments to support maintenance of the grasslands through appropriate grazing management.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Berkovitsa Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes. Berkovitsa is a small municipality which is predominantly (60%) forest with 40% agricultural land consisting mainly of rough upland grazing (natural high mountain pastures, riparian meadows, stony or rocky terrain). There are also some semi-natural (secondary) grasslands created by the clearance of patches of forest. Some small plots of cultivated land also exist, including permanent plantations of strawberries and raspberries.   The size of the area (km2) is 465. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 16.343. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 35.15. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 39.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.19%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 4600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 524. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 13.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3402. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1497. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 18.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 19010. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 27.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.50%.   Innovative farm enterprise grazing an Aberdeen Angus suckler herd on rough high altitude pastures in the Berkovitsa Municipality (MON02) in Montana Province (BG312). This is a very unusual, but potentially very profitable, value chain for this region that combines new products, new farm management practices / production processes and new marketing strategies.   The natural assets used are the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) of the region. Many of these are publically-owned and were historically used as common grasslands under the control of the local municipality. After Bulgaria joined the EU and CAP Pillar I support payments were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    At such high altitude the pastures are increasingly liable to abandonment (due to their inaccessibility, low productivity and poorly targeted policy support) leading to scrub encroachment (by juniper) and the consequent loss of biodiversity value. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. There are four innovations associated with this value chain: a) Setting up a NEW farm holding in the high mountains at a time when people are leaving the region not settling there plus good dialogue and cooperation with other farmers in the region; b) Introduction of suckler beef cows (Aberdeen Angus) there no tradition of grass-fed beef production in the region; c) Establishment of a rotational grazing system using electric fences, and; d) Direct online sales of beef and processed beef products (notably to customers in Sofia) supported by an effective marketing campaign on social media (Facebook and blog). The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
