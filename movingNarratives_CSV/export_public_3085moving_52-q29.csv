Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 23 ES. The average size of the herds is of 176 animals. This breed is focused on meat production, marketing milky goats. The quality is certified with the label 100% Autochthonous breed under the supervision of the Asociación Nacional de Criadores de Ganado Caprino de Raza Blanca Andaluza (ABLANSE) (National Association of Andalusian White Breed Goat Breeders). In addition, the 49% of the productions have the organic certification. The main impact of this VC is transforming ecosystems with high density of bushes, which prevents an over matorralization of forests. Consequently, it works for the fire prevention as these areas are highly prone to summer fires when there is too much woody biomass. In addition the herd improves the soil estructure and quality as well as acting as seed disseminator.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Aroche. It is located in the occidental edge of the Natural Park. The landscape is a mosaic of dehesas and pastures with hilly geography intertwined with forests of holm and cork oaks and chestnuts. It represents an ideal ecosystem for extensive grazers. Consequently, in this MRL, the Iberian pig is also very relevant.   The size of the area (km2) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   There is a successful registration of a quality scheme that aims to retrieve Spanish autochthonous breeds. The Andalusian white goat is an endangered breed. It is adapted to meridional mountain areas, specially to the Andalusian mountain ranges where it grazes extensively producing various ecosystem services.   1) To retrieve the population of this breed; 2) To fight against rural depopulation and the loss of traditional practices by maintaining and nurturing sheperd practices and by making this VC more suitable with modern life (83% of the sheperds are above 40 years old); 3) To improve their market position, increasing the sales and prices to make the VC more profitable. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   This VC is also present in othe MRLs such as Fuente Obejuna (14029), Alanís (41002), Cazalla de la Sierra (41032), Castillo de las Guardas (21031), Alájar (21001), Cumbres Mayores (21029), Encinasola (21031), Villaviciosa de Córdoba (14073)."
