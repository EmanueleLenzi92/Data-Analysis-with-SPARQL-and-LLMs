There are 1000 cattle farms, owning 60 000 animals among which 35 000 cows. 12 000 animals are slaughtered every year, in 3 slaughtering houses (Ajaccio, Ponte Leccia, Porto Vecchio). The Corsican Breed is recognized since 2013 and managed by an agricultural organisation (Chambre d'agriculture). Farmers have organized locally to improve their marketing strategy: vitellu corsu, Carne Niulinca, etc. The regional association promoting organic agriculture (Interbio) is also a strong stakeholder, contributing to federate 14 farmers for direct selling.

Low reputation products, negative reputation linked to this activity, coexistence between mountainous area and plains, strategy of localisation and contribution to villages vividness, competing access to land against other animal husbandry (dairy goat and dairy ewe). Organizing their production, farmers are claiming a right to farm cattle, to gain a revenue from their activity and to exist in rural areas. They are willing to improve cattle farming reputation from extensive and exclusive use of landscape to a legitimate activity, coexisting with more traditional productions such as dairy husbandry or pork-meat production.They struggle in finding an efficient strategy of valorization : which type of animal to slaughter and sell ? Calf, young beef ? Moreover, technical references have long been produced on grazing cattle. What about cattle farmed in natural lands like in Corsica ?.   To organize and to find conditions for durably coexisting with other activities, especially in mountainous areas. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. corsican inhabitants have always own cattle for farm labour. With the implementation of the european agricultural policy, more espacially subsidies linked to mountainous areas, farmers have bought and declared more and more animals, which has been considered as a deviance mixing accusations of large frauds and issues of animal divagation.for one or two decades, a part of the cattle farmers have tried to organize their production and to add value to it. They sell young beef, manzu. They mostly act individually or organize at a local level (association of less than 20 farmers) in order to sell their produce locally. Organic label has been growing as well. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Cattle farming and its interconnexion with organic practices are described in Serbia and Switzerland."
