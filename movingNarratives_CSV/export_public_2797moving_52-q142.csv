Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 FR. Milk lamb is seasonnaly produced, mostly in autumn, by approximatively 300 dairy-ewe farmers. Two associations of farmers intervene for slaughtering the animals and corresponding logistics. There are different circuits for selling the carcasses : direct selling from farmers, butchers' shop, ..   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. Corsica is an island in the sea. It presents a great diversity of landscapes: plains, hillsides, deap and steep valleys Small ruminant farming has long been a transhumant activity, occupying all the region. For the past decades, farmers have settled, in the plains and hillsides. Some of them keep on using mountain pastures during Summer. They are scattered within the region, with no remarkable specialised sub-region. The area of production of PDO Brocciu or for the projet of PGI on milk lamb is Corsica.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   high reputation products, coexistence between mountainous area and plains, competing access to milk (for processing or feeding the lamb), strategy of localisation and contribution to villages vividness, resources linked to pastoral breeding (breeds, feeding species) and their associated know-how are diminushing, traditionnal dishes and local culinary heritage are diminushing as well. With modernization, milk lambs have been a growing issue for dairy producers. They have specialized in producing milk and do not know what to do with lambs. Local culinary uses have been diminushing, contributing to restraining the local markets. Local farmers are looking for levers to improve this situation. local at the SES level and from the point of view of consumers and intermediate profession (butcher shops) could provide new insight.   to (re)assemble resources that have been built and transmitted in the territory (breeds, feeding species.. ), especially to reconect intertwinned activities (milk lamb and dairy production) that have been set appart with agriculture modernization and specialization. To reconnect food production with food uses (cooking, eating habits, etc.). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. One large stakeholder (organization of producers, linked to the biggest dairy) implemented a service that collect the milk lambs of most producers to send them to Sardinia where they are slaughtered. They get the carcasses back and freeze a part of them to sell them later in the year when tourist season has begun. They struggle to add value to their product. farmers have had a project of PGI for their corsican milk lamb for years. They did not succeed yet. They struggle to find durable solutions. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is also present in Austria. Comparaison with production of lamb that is dedicated to meat (Austria, Switzerland, Serbia, Spain) might also been interesting regarding the use of resources linked with specialization."
