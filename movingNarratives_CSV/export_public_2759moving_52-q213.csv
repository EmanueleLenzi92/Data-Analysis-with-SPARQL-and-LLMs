Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 CZ. Farms - goat breeding, goat husbandry, grazing, perennial grassland management. Farms implement organic farming methods. Vast majority of farms process their own milk, produce dairy producsts and sell these products. Most farms operate in organic farming scheme. Typical marketing chanells include (sales on farm, farmers markets, farm shops in nearby towns). Regional and other quality labels are not so important. The 'goat products' represent a strong brand per se. Demand for such products is fairly high, consumers are willing to pay high premiums for such products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Prachatice. Prevailing area of the region (LAU 1 - Prachatice) consist of submontane highlands (with altitude 600-800 meters). Some settlements are located in the altitude around 800 meters. Climate conditions are affected by relatively high altitude of the region. The region is rich of forestsw, which cover 52 % of the region. Share of agricultural land (due to the high altitude) is above regional average (wthin NUTS 3 level). The region is highly attractive for tourist during WInter and Summer season due to the unique nature. The region includes two nature protected areas.   The size of the area (km2) is 1377. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 410. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1378. The total population (in thousand) is 50.978. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 37. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 69.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9511.27. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9783.27. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.00%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9836.73. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 19458.96. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 43.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 52.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 62533. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.67%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4971. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 150. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 53.90%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Goat husbandry is less common in mountain areas than the cattle husbandry. The VC has become recently popular with the rising interest in alternative food chains. On farming level the farms located in nature protected areas implement specific grazing management. Goats are capable to utilize different plants in perennial grassland than cows. This gives them specific function in environmental managements. Vast majority of farms use organic farming methods. A typical business model consists of milk production as well as the processing and producting of dairy products (fresh cheese, youghurt, hard cheese etc. depending on the volume of milk which they produce). Farms are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products.   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The goat farms and their products are highly attractive for tourists. Some of them offer also services in agro-tourism.    The goat farms usually manage smaller farm land in comparison to cattle farms. Land market (due to the available subsidies) is highly competetive. It is difficult for relatively smaller farms to increase farm size (if they want to), because the land is not avilable. Dairy products represent alternative food products in the eyes of consumers, because you can usually buy them in conventional supermarkets. Consumers have to attend farmers markets, sepcialized shops or travel directly to farms. The goat farms in this way plays important functions in connecting urban consumers with small-scale farms producing artisan and high-quality food products. The goat farms heavily rely on sufficent amount of grass. Recent years showed that in certain periods of dry Summer (e.g in year 2018) there might be a shortage of the feedstuff for animals. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is associated with development of new food producst that are not so common in food menu of mainstream consumers. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land and grazing meadows and management of perennial grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   It is likely that the VCs spans over the country borders. Similar examples can be thus found in Germany and Austria."
