Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is NMK. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 NMK. Key actors dealing with honey in Maleshevija and the kew brands: a) Pcelarstvo Bobolibbksi b) Shumi Med c) Maleshevski Med d) Pcelarstvo Radinski . At national level there are 2 national federations that are members of a larger umbrella organization called the Federation of Farmers of Republic of Macedonia that unites all farmers in the country. Organic beekeepers are each individually involved through the local associations of producers into the Macedonian Organic Producers Federation which represents exclusively the interests of organic producers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Mountain Meleshevija. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is unspecified. Maleshevski mountains are located in the eastern part of the Republic of North Macedonia. The are covers the municipalities of Berovo and Pehchevo, and is characterized with the natural and cultural wealth. Two rivers cross the region, Bregalnica and Strumica. Forests covers 52% of the Maleshevija region, while pastures around 20%.   The size of the area (km2) is 806. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 660. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1932. The total population (in thousand) is 174.341. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 49.3. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 83.4. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.20%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 5056. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 769. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 9.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 45.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 44.53%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5175. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 9332. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.75%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 62.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2088. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 26003. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 30.50%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 53.30%.   Because of the geographical location and the relief of Macedonia, the climate in the country is partly Mediterranean and Continental, and on the mountains with peaks over 2000 meters the climate is Mountainous and it offers a very good condition for the bee keepers across the country. Production of bee genetic material from Macedonian bee (Apis mellifera macedonica) is well recognized. The bees from the region are producing high quality honey, with a clear identity od the cleaned environment, such as Maleshevija. Beyond the traditional usage of honey, nowadays it is used in different final products, such as in pharmacy, cosmetics, consumer goods etc. As an ingredients as well as for taste/ flavor. Many families from Maleshevija are engaged with the bee keeping, while the region offers very good conditions for that. It is also important to mention that, due to the highly developed biodiversity of honey flora, 98% of the honey in the country is polyfloral. Some recent studies have shown that only 2% of the honey is monofloral and this honey is produced from white acacia (Ribinia pseudoacacia).   Global climate change, environmental pollution, the decrease in natural lands under human pressure weaken the bees and make them more vulnerable to diseases. Chemicals used sometimes wrongly and needlessly, by farmers and beekeepers, excessive and unnecessary treatment of the hive/colony, are threating the honey in Maleshevija mountain. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Honey is used in different final innovative products. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Given that honey is a usual product, it is also present in other Member States."
