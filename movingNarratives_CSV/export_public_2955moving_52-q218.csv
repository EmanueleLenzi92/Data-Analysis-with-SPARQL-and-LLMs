'Pastrama de Oaie' is a very traditional and widespread mountain product. This example is produced by a family farming in the mountains above the town of Novaci (78258) in Gorj County (RO412). It is very well-known by local tourists and is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/pastrama-oaie-stana-stefanu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Pastrama de Oaie' is the semi-natural and alpine grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing) in the mountain areas of Gorj County (RO412). Many of the communal pastures used for grazing sheep and cattle are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and associated dairy products and the consumption of sheepmeat is steadily declining due to changing consumer preferences. 'Pastrama de Oaie' continues to maintain a very specific niche in the market since it is very seasonal and especially sought after for traditional summer barbecues / grills. However, products such as this rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are an increasing number of specialist butcher shops looking for good quality local meat products), but this also brings additional challenges for traditional small-scale businesses - including compliance with food hygiene and safety rules. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
