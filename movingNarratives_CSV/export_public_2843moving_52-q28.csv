An ecological vegetable garden in the mountains of Börzsöny, run in partnership by 5 individual producers and the local authority. They use permaculture and aim to sell their products (vegetables, friut) through a box scheme. This is the first year of the project, they are in the phase of development. Selling in box-scheme and the method of permaculture are new processes this VC uses. Also, a working partnership amongst 5 producers and a local authority + local employment programme is a new system of governance.   The VC uses nearly 1 ha land. They use local methods to produce and also, local traditional types, rooted in the local culture. Co-operating with the local municipality is a social asset.    Challenges in connection with climate change (draughts, extreme weather events, etc.). Unexpected difficulties due to inexperience (it's their first seson). E.g. the customerts doesn t have to pay in advance yet - they don t know if they will have regular customers. Working in partnership with each-other and the local authority (including a local employment programme) carries many possibilities for conflicts and problems. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Selling in box-scheme and the method of permaculture is innovative, but producing local varieties with ecological approach is traditional. The actors of this VC are young urban incommers, they study agriculture, so they bring a lot of external knowledge. Using local varieties counts endogenous. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
