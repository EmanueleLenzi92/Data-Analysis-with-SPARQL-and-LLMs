Beef cattle breeding is together with sheep breeding the main activity on pasture land in mountain areas in Slovakia. Thus it contributes to pasture maintenance. There is an increasing number of farms converting their conventional production to an organic one. However, beef cattle breeding in the Slovak mountains is also facing numerous challenges.   Natural assets are agricultural land uses - grassland. Social assets are skills of farmers.    1) import of livestock products from other countries 2) lack of young farmers who would ensure continuity from one generation to the next 3) low salary for field workers 4) relatively low per capita consumption of beef meat in Slovakia. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as N/A.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and social.   Beef cattle breeding is to some extent present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
