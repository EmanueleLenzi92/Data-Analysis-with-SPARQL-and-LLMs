Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC CH 01. Key actors of the VC are represented mostly by small individual winegrowers, who are selling the grapes to bigger private wineries. Most of the producers, 75,8%, cultivate an area smaller than 0.2 ha, so some of the small winegrowers tend to cooperate vinifying their harvests together, in order to guarantee the requested quality standards.The high level imposed by the VITI label has had a decisive influence in making Ticino wine known and appreciated on the national market, and has helped to ensure a progressive economic interest in local wine-growing.

Ticino's vineyards are an example of high quality mountain viticulture, with vineyards planted on terraces scattered in small parcels, The VITI quality label characterising quality red wine, produced strictly from Merlot grapes.   Key local assets include splendid mountain scenary coupled to the Mediterranean climat, very favorable for wine production. The large majority of Ticino vines have always been grown on terraces. Their function is to protect the soil from erosion by the heavy rainfall typical of the prealpine zone. In terms of vines, the key local asset is Merlot, international grape variety, well adapted to the specific climatic conditions of the region.    The main challenge remains to find solutions to optimise the profitability of vineyards on steeply sloping terrain. In terms of sustainability the ecological value of mountain can be further enhanced through the biodiversity enhancement and safeguarding. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural."
