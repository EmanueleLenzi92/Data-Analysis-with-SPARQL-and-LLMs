Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 UK. The distinctive and dramatic North-West Highland landscape is based on the contrast and vicinity of the mountains to the coast. Wildlife tourism in the area also benefits from this proximity, often combining opportunities to see marine, coastal, and mountain species. Tour operators include national companies and local guides who offer flexible and bespoke tours. Wildlife tourism in the wider Scottish Highlands was estimatled to be worth £124 million in 2010. Local markets for wildlife and birdwatching also presents opportunities relating to physical and mental well-being. However, there are difficulties in defining this value chain, in terms of it's distinctness from other forms of countryside tourism, and the national/regional tourism 'product', whichs build on iconography of key species in branding and characterisation of the Highlands in terms of wildness. Non-specific/informal wildlife and nature tourism experiences are contributory in tourism motivations and satisfaction (generating return visits).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Caithness and Sutherland. Caithness and Sutherland is situated in the far north of the Scottish/UK mainland and is very remote from large cities. It has a very low population density with most people living in towns and villages on the coast: the inland area features large areas of moors and wetlands, and the region has a long coastline to the west, north and east. The area has suffered depopulation in the last ten years. The largest town (Thurso) has an important ferry link to the Orkney Islands.   The size of the area (km2) is 7862.109361. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -4. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 994. The total population (in thousand) is 38.246. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 4.86. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.43%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 22243.38. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2345.4. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 73.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8124. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 13.52%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 340. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.16%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.33%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 75.51%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   This type of tourism is based on visitors' being able to experience wild places and view, study, or enjoy focal species (e.g. red deer, ptarmigan, mountain hare, golden eagle, peregrine) in alpine and sub-alpine habitats. The value chain is dispersed and ad hoc, but includes wildife tour operators, as well as small-scale accommodation, providers, and other hospitality and service-based businesses based in remote rural communities. Seasonality relates to both tourism demand and natural seasons (e.g. mating, migrations, births, flowering/dormancy). Interest in wildife and nature is not new but the routes and opportunities that it might be accessed are ever changing with IT, social media, destination marketing, and profile-raising of habitats, species and their importance in the context of climate and biodiversity crises.   Flora and fauna species in the north-west Highlands, including red deer, ptarmigan, mountain hare, golden eagle, peregrine, mosses, lichens, liverworts, alpine bearberry, juniper, crowberry, cowberry, mountain sedges. The dramatic landscape and geology represent high scenic value for visitors. Environmental and cultural knowledge by land managers and locals that link to the tourism sector (e.g. tour guides, hospitality and accomodation providers) increased the value of visitors' stay through information and interpretation.    Wildlife disturbance/ecological impacts of visitors. Challenges relating difficulty/scarcity of sightings; which may be increased by professional guides, and/or mitigated through multi-purpose trips. Climate change impacts might include 'positive' and negative effects for species and habitats. Land ownership and land use factors contribute to habitat preservation/destruction and the nature of access for visitors to wild areas. Species reintroduction projects intoduces potential opportunities and conflict for the sector. Covid-19 has resulted in increased visitor numbers/impacts in parts of rural Scotland, based on social-distancing (open spaces) and renewed well-being motivations. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Commercialisation of a traditional activity, including wildlife tours designed for tourism markets, element of desination product and imagery, online bookability, bespoke 'experiences' catering to visitor demand and trends for authenticity and nature. Links to remote and virtual experiences, e.g. TV programmes such as Autumn Watch, instalation of webcams, and rise of social media experience and photography sharing, stimulating demand to view species in their natutral habitat. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and other. The land use systems involved are Grassland, forestry and natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Nature and wildlife-based tourism is prevalent throughout the mountainous areas of the UK through formal opportunities provided by landowners, including trail and visitor centres, and informal opportunities by the public accessing areas (over farm and other managed land) without designated facilities. Value chains assocated with wildlife tourism in more populous areas (e.g. Merthyr Tydfil, LAU1), tourism hotspots (e.g. Lochaber, LAU1), and national parks (e.g. Badenoch and Strathspey, LAU1) differ, often in terms of higher commerical value and formal opportunities associated with wildlife parks and way-marked trail, but lost of the 'wildness' that attracts particular segments of the market to the mountains of Sutherland and other areas such as Ross and Cromarty (LAU1). Wildlife tourism opportunities are also present in other value chains such as VC 04 UK (sporting game -- which presents interesting debate based on overlap between shooting and love of wildlife), VC 08 UK (rewilding), and other forms of tourism (climbing/hillwalking, winter sports, adventure tourism, agritourism)."
