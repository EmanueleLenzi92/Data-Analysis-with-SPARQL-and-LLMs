Sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia. The sheep wool is a by-product of sheep breeding. During the last decades, wool was not processed. It was a dangerous waste, possible to destroy only in rendering plants. The shepherds must pay for the destruction of wool. Thus, any solution for wool processing means an innovation (or retro-innovation) in Slovakia. Recently, some processors in Slovakia started to focus on manual wool processing as an innovation of traditions. The national policy also promised to assist farmers with wool sales and industrial processing. New products from otherwise hazarduous waste material (retro innovation). There are also sheep wool processing workshops. Today, people are returning to old crafts, including the traditional processing of sheep's wool.   Grassland or feed for sheep, sheep, knowledge about wool processing.    1) Slovak sheep farmers have a long-term problem with the sales of sheep wool. Often, the income from the wool sale does not even cover the cost of shearing sheep. Thus, the wool ends up in rendering plants buried or burned. Only a tiny percentage of it is sold - primarily for foreign markets. A significant drop in prices was caused by cheap sheep wool imported from abroad. 2) Currently, there is not industrial wool processor in Slovakia. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. A tradition of manual wool processing has been rediscovered again. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
