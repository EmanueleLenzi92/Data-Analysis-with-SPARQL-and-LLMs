Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 1. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 22 CH1. Fish was not traditionally produced in the alps, but seeing that a lot of fish is consumed in Switzerland and most of it is imported, there have been projects launched to produce high-quality fish. The fish is sold to restaurant or to private individuals through direct farm and online shops. We know of two examples: Lake trout by CarpederFood in Grisons and salmon by Alpenlachs in Ticino.
