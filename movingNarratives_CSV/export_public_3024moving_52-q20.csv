There are two types of handicraft, the soft handicrafts and the hard ones. The first one consists of clothes, jewellery and baskets of woven birch branches and are traditionally made by women, while the hard ones are knives and cups of reindeer antlers, which are mostly manufactured by men. Traditional materials are reindeer leather, bones and antlers, natural woods, specially from birch, and silver for clothes and jewellery. Both the Sami handicraft making and souvenir purchase in Sapmi region are also touristic assets. Handicrafts can be found in stores and in Sami markets and festivals. In 1980 the Sami Duodji trademark was established for tracing authentic Sami products and , although different national organisations certify the products within each country's boundaries (Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia), the ownership rights correspond to the Sami Council.

This VC is based on the cultural heritage of the only indigenous community of Europe. The origin of the materials is mainly the natural ecosystems and the reindeers. The innovation is related to the turn into a market oriented production fostering the development of regional markets and e-commerce strategies to reach more public.   This VC is highly related to reindeer herding and the nomadic Sami ancient lifestyle. Consequently, they had to craft their own tools and get the materials from nature. Most of them come from reindeer (antlers, skin and bones) and birch wood from local forests. Knowledge on how to make them has been carried through generations and the style and techniques could vary among the ethnic groups.    1) Threat on Sapmi terrritory driven by extrative industries (mining, logging, energy); 2) To maintain the knowledge and interest of Sami people in handcrafting. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The VC is innovative as it represents a novel bussiness model for the Sami community to make tools and clothes for commertial purposes. Nonetheless, the assets and means remain traditional.

The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The VC is present all along Sapmi area in Norway, Sweden (Jokkmokk SE2510 or Kiruna) and Finland."
