Lanjarón is a brand of natural mineral water owned by Aguas Danone, SA (a Danone Group company), which comes from the Salud spring in Lanjarón in the Sierra Nevada massif in the province of Granada, where it is also bottled. Lanjarón water is very weakly mineralised. All Lanjarón bottles will be made of recycled plastic by 2021. Besides, they will use a new cap format that remains attached to the bottle. Since its birth, commitment to the environment has been associated with Lanjarón natural mineral water, given its privileged origin. For years, Lanjarón has been dedicating part of its profits to financing different actions to fight against waste disposal and in favor of the circular economy and against depopulation and other socio-ecological problems.   Mineral waters have established by law a perimeter of protection, an aquifer recharge zone, keeping under control human, industrial, and livestock activities as long as they do not affect the quantity or quality of the mineral water. Some waters have the added protection of being born in a National Park, such as the Sierra Nevada.    Faced with a private company's business challenges, the company is committed to the environmental and global challenges of our society. Specifically, in the case of Lanjarón, this represents a commitment to nature, reducing the impact of industrial activity, protecting the environment, and promoting the use of sustainable materials and packaging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.
