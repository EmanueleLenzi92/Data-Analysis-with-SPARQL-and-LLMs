Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 45 IT. the most important production is organic beef, produced totally on pasture, processed locally and sold at regional level. Organic dairy production and sheep breeding are restarting (the used to be common but they were abandoned). The organic management is a tool for landscape management, linked to touristic activities, that integrate the agriculture economy. The whole are is ruled as organic district.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Central Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Varese Ligure. Val di Vara is the inner part of La Spezia province. It is about 345 km2 in 7 municipalities. The hight on sea level ranges from 120 m to 1639 m. It is an area very closed to the seaside and very popular touristic destinations but for decades neglected and progressively depopulated. It never benefited from the touristic activity of proximal coast areas. It is scarcely populated (6.239 inhabitants in 2017). It is the Norther part of Appennine mountain chain.   The size of the area (km2) is 136.58. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 246. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1551. The total population (in thousand) is 1.89. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 13.8. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -13.18%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 282. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -5.58%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 12286. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 5996. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.58%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 18.50%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 80.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16461. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 44571.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 18.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 80.20%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 70. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 12.04%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 5962. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 19.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 78.90%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 1.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 19.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 78.90%.   1) it is one of the few cases where land abandonment and misuse was successfully reverted thanks to organizational and agronomic innovation; 2) the social/collective dimension of the initiative; 3) it can be an example to be copied in other valleys/areas. 1) social dimension involving all public and private actors of different sectors, not only agriculture; 2) it is a success and there are not many; 3) it is a mountain area with all the difficulties related to it, but being so closed to very attractive touristic areas it is often neglected and potentials not exploited. Similar situations exists in other areas.   1. social: strong cooperation and engagement from all actors, including policy makers at local and regional level 2. environmental: acknowledged quality of the landscape and organic animal husbandry as a tool to preserve it.    1) to avoid the misuse of the fame gained by the valley by external actors, who process in the area agriculture products from other areas; 2) the need of continuity in the community facilitation; 3) population aging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The key is the use of organic animal breeding techniques in beef cattle management. It strongly linked to pasture management and quality and it becomes the basis also of landscape preservation. All these value were acknowledged by the community of the ca and agriculture (animal husbandry, mainly beef production) is the main activity. Landscape value is very high and areas are well preserved. Since early 2000s local farmers and associations of the area work for reverting the abandonment through the use of organic practices to add value to the area and in 2013 the organic District was officially acknowledged by the Regional Government. Since then many activities were stared: touristic, educational, agricultural etc. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Natural land and Pasture. The local assets include Natural and social.   Liguria is the only region where Organic Districts are regulated by a Regional law. The organic district is part of the AIAB biodistretti network and is often promoted as good example for setting up other biodistretti."
