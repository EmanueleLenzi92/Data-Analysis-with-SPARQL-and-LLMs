In addition to other vegetables and herbs, peeled seedless pumpkins began to be grown in Boldva, in the framework in a public employment based social enterprise, giving livelihood to poor, disadvantaged social groups (mainly Roma). A small processing plant, including high tech solar drying equipment was built, branding, design, a small shop was developed and short food chains approached with the products in the area. The municipality initiated this project, which is not common, there is a high level of co-operation and community spirit in the village in the framework of a social enterprise. The products are traditional, however, well designed and packaged for wealthy customers, sold through short chains. They imply solar energy during production and processing and use social networks and ICT for marketing.   The VC uses the natural resources of the area, they cultivate a pumpkin plantation to produce raw material for the pumpkin seed oil and also produce herbs. The cooperation within the village, the support of the local authority, the local human resources are cornerstones of the project. They have become part of the local territorial quality assurance system.    Challenges in connection with climate change (draughts, extreme weather events, etc.) and the potentially less yield due to these issues. Difficulties of working with disadvantaged social groups and continouosly changing policy environment. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The municipality s program provides jobs for locals and produces high-quality products that are sold through both short and long supply chains. They use solar energy for drying. The design of the products is beautiful and demanding. The project is the mayor's initiative and is implemented with the locals - the innovation is endogenous. However, the financial support that enabled the process was coming from the government, through an employment programme. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The initiative is part of the local territorial quality mark system."
