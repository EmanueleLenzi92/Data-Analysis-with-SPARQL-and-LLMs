Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 UK. Key activities: tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna; key actors - land owners (NGOs or wealthy philanthropists); consultants; students/academics and volunteers; inputs include seedlings for tree planting, materials for gully blocking, path and fencing, scientific monitoring equipment, lots of marketing (websites, social media). ; outputs - increased habitat quality, increased flora and fauna populations, increased skills and understanding, piloting new natural capital monitoring tools (that may lead to a quality scheme). V dependent on SES system and claims to improve social as well as ecological aspects of the system, particulalry where education, skills and housing are included. Aim to show that investing in natural capital can generate more 'value' than traditional value chains in these landscapes.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Inverness and Nairn. Inverness and Nairn is a region in northern Scotland. The vast majority of its population live in the growing city of Inverness and its surroundings, which is a major hub for transport links, economic activity and services. This area includes part of the Moray Firth coastline and some lowland agricultural areas, but large areas of sparsely populated mountains, including the well-known tourist region of Loch Ness.   The size of the area (km2) is 3331.510381. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1179. The total population (in thousand) is 94.963. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 28.50. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 6.50%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 22078.39. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6416.79. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.37%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 35.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 63.63%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 15574. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 25.92%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 167. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.82%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.45%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.73%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   There are two estates in this LAU1 where traditional estates (mix of farmed and forested land) have been bought and land use changed to restore more natural habitat and restore ecological functions as well as providing educational programmes.Dundreggan (10,000 acres) wants to restore Caledonian (native pinewood) Forest through tree planting and removing grazing pressure. A rewilding Centre will open in 2022; and the estate is part of the wider 'East West Wild' initiative (linking this LAU1 to Skye and Lochaber). Bunloit (1262 acres) is planting trees, using extensive grazing and natural regneration to increase biodiversity and reach net Zero including building eco-homes. There is also the 'Lifescape' project (100 acres) that is in the 'Highlands' near Loch Ness (location restricted to protect the rare species) which is in the area. As noted, the product (more nature) is novel, and also the processes (restoration) are often trials not used before. In both cases, the estate owners participate in national and international networks that are new. Finally, there are often academic partners undertaking RandD on these living laboratories. There is also some limited local knowledge about how the land used to be, and what works, being accessed through the citizen science, volunteering and 'building bridges' networking with local farmers. However, most expertise is exogenous to the locality.   As described above, these estates are fairly typical of upland Scottish estates - mix of forestry, semi-natural habitats and rough grazing - some designated areas under EU Natura 2000 or UK designation, sheep and cattle grazing and potentially hunting deer - but have been repurposed to reduce production of timber and meat (there is some timber/lamb production) and increase the production of public goods (regulating and cultural ecosystem services). The future success of the rewilding will depend on local as well as national support and acceptance of this switch. It is unclear from desktop research how much cultural (local) knowledge is involved, with many partners in the rewilding effort coming from elsewhere in the UK or even internationally.    Rewilding is very contentious in Scotland (for example the Nature Agency does not use the term). It's proponents critique traditional approaches to upland land management as damaging to Nature, and increases in native (or reintroduced) species e.g. boar, golden eagles, beavers can create damage to livestock or pasture; whilst trees decrease grazing available to wild game (deer, grouse). Much rewilding is associated with public funding or public donations (NGOs) or wealthy philantrophists; and investments are often tied to predicted returns from carbon markets or wildlife tourism, which are relatively high-risk long term investments. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Whilst rewilding is not 'new' (Alladale Estate in Sutherland started in 2003), it has become much more prominent with the increased focus on resolving the climate and bio diversity crises; and there have been several recent investments in land to 'rewild' them. The innovation tends to start with the change in ownership with an 'external' owner taking over the land, and often involves external expert consultants to undertake the monitoring and advise on ecological measures. Some of the measures require contractors (e.g. large machinery to plant trees) which are not available locally. However, these estates prioritise involving local volunteers and training local people in conservation jobs. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and freshwater wetlands. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   In Scotland there are also other rewilding projects in Sutherland (Alladale Estate); Badendoch (Glenfeshie Estate + others for Cairngorms Connect); Carrifran Wildwood (Dumfries and Galloway), Glenlude (Scottish Borders), Bamff Estate (Perthshire), Creag Meagaigh (Badenoch), Mar Lodge (Aberdeenshire), Knoydart (Lochaber). There are other upland projects in England (Wild Ennerdale, Haweswater, Lowther, Gettsdale in the Lake District; Ingleborough and Broughton in N Yorkshire Moors). The rewilding network site doesn't have any Welsh or Northern Ireland examples but we suspect they exist. Note there are also lowland and coastal rewilding projects. A mixture of estates owned by wealthy philanthropists, NGOs, Government and collective trusts - all committed to conservation restoration that create jobs and new economic opps. Note often a strong cross-over with VC 07 Peatland restoration for carbon credits e.g. Rottal Estate in Angus also labels itself as a rewilding project."
