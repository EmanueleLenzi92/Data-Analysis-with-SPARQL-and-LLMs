Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 FR. The activity is organized mainly around the Defense and Management Organization of the PDO. The diseases of orchards and the local uses of flour (pulenta) leads that farmers cannot reach all the demand. Maintaining brushless ecosystems around villages is a new challenge. The value of the chestnut can no longer be examined solely from the point of view of chestnut production but also from the point of view of issues linked to a complex resource environment, a common that involves other categories of actors (municipality, community associations, amateurs and professionals).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the homogeneity of resources, dieseases impcats, driving skills, chestnut varieties and PDO products.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   Omnipresent in mountain. Its productions are a pillar in the traditional Corsican diet. Its relaunch was made from chestnut flour which obtained a PDO in 2010. All AOP productions adhere to Organic Agriculture (AB). The flour comes from the regeneration of a very small part of the existing orchards which mostly suffer from fungal diseases (phytophtora and Cryphonectria ). The health situation worsened sharply with the arrival of the Cynips (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) which called into question the existence of the trade of chestnut farmer. The interest of the Corsican chestnut grove stems from the high valuation of the flour obtained thanks to the PDO of a mountain activity in a context of high vulnerability (diseases, degeneration of orchards, global warming) and loss of control of the Perivillage area. The chestnut grove is based on a heritage value which can today be reinforced by the new food and spatial challenges. The final value is the result of a combination of values of different natures: the culture of the nourishing tree, constitution of income, maintenance of ecosystems and management of space.   Maintain orchards currently in production, plant replacement trees by constituting village communes: subsistence purpose, additional income and control of space. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The innovation lies in the control of the sanitary state of the trees associated with the constitution of the chestnut grove as a common resource of the villages of Corsica. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry (The chestnut grove constitutes a domestic forest with an economic and landscape value.). The local assets include Social and cultural.   Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Swiss. Italy (production of chestnut flour too) and Turkey (high value product under GI too)."
