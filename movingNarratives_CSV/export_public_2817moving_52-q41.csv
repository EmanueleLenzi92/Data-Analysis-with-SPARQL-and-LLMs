Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 GR. Dittany has been growing wildly on Crete s mountains inside fissures and calcareous cliffs since ancient times. It is depicted in frescos and myths as a healing herb. It is part of the cultural heritage of Greece and on Crete and it is tied to communal foraging- collecting practices, essential oil extraction and healing rituals depicting how the bio-diversity of the agricultural ecosystems can be brought in harmony with human praxis and be utilized for their benefit. Nowadays, the foraging practices are depicted in collectives in Crete, such as 'Apo Koinou' that harvest herbs such as dittany and bring them to market. Currently the use of Embaros dittany in liquors, cosmetics, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals depict how ancient cultural traditions are cycled into new industries, forms of production, commerce, and ultimately, how a value chain is re-constituted in the postmodern world. The Agricultural Coop of Emparos, Viannos Heraklion, is the major actor in this chain, but faces many challenges. All in all, the biodiversity of the Cretan ecosystems is coupled with human activities years ago in the organized groups of collectors, today in Cretan cooperatives such as apo koinou , to koukouli , Agri Herb and others. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Dikti Mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is EMBAROS. Dicti mountain range has a maximum altitude of 2,148. Large parts of the mountain area are forested with pines (Pinus brutia), Kermes oaks (Quercus coccifera), cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens), Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex) and Cretan Maples (Acer sempervirens).The topology of the mountain range is rich with plateaus, valleys and secondary peaks. The fertile valleys and plateaus of Dikti/Dicte are of significant importance in the local economy. Dittany adapts greatly and grows especially in thegorges, limestone soils and cliffs of the mountain. The size of the area (km2) is 221.5.

Dittany is an endemic plant found on ravines and cliffs in mountainous areas of Dikti. It has been cultivated for many years, and its cultivation now centres on Embaros and the surrounding villages, south of Heraklion, where Mount Dikti is situated. Dittany is one of the priority species in the NATURA 2000 Network areas in Crete. In the past, the demand for plant material was covered only by the collection of wild populations, a fact which led to their rapid decrease and extinction from several areas of the island.Wild populations are given legal protection as a vulnerable species. The reasons for selecting Dittany are many. They include sociocultural ties with the community since antiquity, new byproducts and innovative processing, Dittany's ancient history, byproducts, and potential use in pharmaceuticals render it a dynamic product. Dittany's resilience having existed since ancient times, faced extinction and weathered fluctuations in both the natural environment and the socioeconomic levels. Dittany has been known as a 'healing herb' since antiquity, it is sold as tea, its essential oil has been used since the middle ages in liquors, and exported for decades around the world. The ancient recipe of extracting Dictamnus in Olive oil produces dictamelia a patented byproduct produced in Crete where both olive trees and dittany grow widely and are cultivated traditionally. Larger processing and packaging industries also exist and have also entered the e-commerce world.   Natural environment protected in that wild dittany is a protected from extinction. Part of Crete s cultural heritage both in the ecosystem and healing practices levels are continued. Community of practice initiatives that existed in Crete s village community subsistence praxis collectors of herbs and medicines that were exported around the world re-emerging in current practices within collectives and in larger industries where processing, packaging, and distilling occur. Today s products (cosmetics, nutraceuticals etc.) are produced on Crete and also exported.Also, the communities of practice that existed where the collectors of wild dittany were organised groups of local people called Erontades , Atitanologi , Botanologi or Mazoctades who travelled across Crete in order to collect dittany and bring to market.These traditions and community practices depict how the bio-diversity of agricultural ecosystems can be brought in harmony with human praxis and be utilized for their benefit. Although cultivation of dictumnus increased greatly up until 1990, there are incosistencies in cultivation and market value. Of the several reasons for the drop in dittany cultivation, the most important is the lack of a properly organized marketing system for such a crop. In general, dittany of Crete has been characterized as a threatened and vulnerable species. Efforts to cultivate dittany in other areas of the country were not successful. This showcases that the climatic conditions of Embaros play an important role in the growth of dittany. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovation involves new products and processing. Namely, an ancient recipe of extracting Dictamnus in Olive oil is now a patented byproduct and is being used as the basis in natural cosmetics. Both Dittany and olive oil are cultivated in the Dicti mountain region. Currently, with e-commerce and the 'natural cosmetic' industry marketing improvements may increase value. Dittany value chain is also valorized by tourism. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Currently the use in of dittany in liquors, cosmetics, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals depict how ancient cultural traditions can cycle into new industries, forms of production, commerce. These products are produced in Italy and other European countries. In Crete, it is found mainly in Embaros, Herakleion and Episkopi, Rethymno."
