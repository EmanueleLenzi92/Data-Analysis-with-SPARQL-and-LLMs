Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 ES. The bees are not fixed in a same place during the whole year, instead, they are moved to different locations along the region to get more flavours. In the case of this VC, the bee products have the organic certification from the Andalusian Comitee of Organic Agriculture. They own 1.200 bee hives and produce around 80000 kg of honey per year. They produce a positive impact on the social-ecological-system as the bee keeping is an activity that, if it is not overexploited, generates multiple benefits in the local ecosystems through the pollination.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Obejo. Obejo, located in the Guadiato Valley, is a hilly area covered by mediterranean forest and olive plantations, crossed by multiple rivers and streams.   The size of the area (km2) is 214.61.

The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13172. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13153.1.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   High quality product linked to an ecosystem that offers high diversity of flora for the bees. Apart from the conventional marketing and commercialisation, nowadays the e-commerce is also being used. There are new products associated with honey and bee keeping. The new marketing strategies include the organic certification, the e-commerce and the cooperation with bigger food retaliers that distribute nationwide and across the EU.   1) Bussiness growing and possible access to new markets nationwide and even beyond, in other European countries; 2) effects of climate change on the flowering periods; 3) diseases that attack the bees. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. 1) New products associated with honey such as propoplis, royal jelly, meloja (cooked honey with pumpkin fibers), and nuts bars; 2) New products on honey-based cosmetics that reach the 30% of the bussiness profits; 3) Organic certification and e-commerce. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   It is also present in othe MRLs such as Montoro (14043) but without the organic certification."
