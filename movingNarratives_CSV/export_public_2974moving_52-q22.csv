Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 UK. Just as Scottish heather can be used to make honey, it is also used in jewellery making. The woody stems of heather provide no nutriional value for wildlife and so by using it in jewellery as a comodity this is also a small way of regenerating the landscape. Heathergems in Perth and Kinross is the main producer/prossesor or heather jewellery. It is cut, cleaned and dyed and compressed and soaked with resin to then cut into shapes for jewellery. One main manufacturer but mutiple online stockists. Mountainous natural land is needed to provide the heather in the first place. Heathergems has 37 employees and its holding company is worth £3.3 million (net assets).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Eastern Scotland (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Perth and Kinross. Most of Perth and Kinross is an sparsely populated upland landscape of mountains, lochs and forests, including major rivers (Tay, Earn). The south contains high quality agricultural land and major road and rail links, and the largest settlement of Perth. Like many other parts of the Highlands, this region is popular for tourism and outdoor recreation: it is a relatively accessible area for residents of Scotland's central belt.   The size of the area (km2) is 5383.724292. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1084. The total population (in thousand) is 151.95.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 83.86%.   heather jewellery (i.e. heather gems producer) is unique to Perth and Kinross but sold globally online. Their products are of high reputation due to the connection with the land and the traditional processes for turning the heather into jewellery. It is important for moving given that the heather is produced in mountainous areas but simultaneously the removal of the heather helps with regeneration of the mountainous areas (as heather has no nutritional value to wildlife). Heather gems (www.heathergems.com) is the main producer - based in Pitlochry within Perth and Kinross LAU1. Heather processing (i.e., from cutting to finished product) is innovative through its use of very traditional methods for processing. Although they are not new processes, the decision to maintain old processes is somewhat innovative. Also, heathergems sell their products online through a number of stockists - opening up a global market.   Natural assets - product (heather) is directly taken from mountainous areas. Cultural assets - processes for heathergem jewellery making goes back 50+ years so relies on traditional knowledge. Also an interest in the scottish landscape/ Scottish culture is needed to ensure there is a viable market for selling heather jewellery. Social assets - requires good relatinoship with the land/ estate managers where the heather is picked from.    Relies on production of heather in mountainous area for initial product so important to have strong working relationships with the landowneres (i.e., so they do not decide to use the land for another purpose). Sell online so potentially less restricted by Brexit/ COVID impacts, but cannot compete with larger producers if others start to sell similar products. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. innovative through the continues use of traditional processes for heather jewellery making and new means of selling (i.e., online stores, etsy etc.). The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Could not find other examples of heather jewellery making in other MRLs, but there are examples of pressed flower jewellery (i.e. flower enclosed in a necklace) throughout the UK by small producers on etsy."
