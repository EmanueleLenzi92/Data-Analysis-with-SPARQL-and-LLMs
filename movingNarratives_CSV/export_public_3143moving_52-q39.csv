Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 45 CH2. The VC is very short and includes farmers and potentially resellers in local markets as raw milk cannot be stored for a long time and is mainly sold directly.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corgémont; Cormoret; Cortébert; Courtelary; La Ferrière; Mont-Tramelan; Orvin; Renan (BE); Romont (BE); Saint-Imier; Sonceboz-Sombeval; Sonvilier; Tramelan; Villeret; Sauge; Péry-La Heutte; Belprahon; Champoz; Corcelles (BE); Court; Crémines; Eschert; Grandval; Loveresse; Moutier; Perrefitte; Reconvilier; Roches (BE); Saicourt; Saules (BE); Schelten; Seehof; Sorvilier; Tavannes; Rebévelier; Petit-Val; Valbirse; La Neuveville; Nods; Plateau de Diesse; Hauenstein-Ifenthal; Kienberg; Lostorf; Rohr (SO); Trimbach; Wisen (SO); Oberhof; Bullet; Concise; Fiez; Fontaines-sur-Grandson; Grandevent; Mauborget; Mutrux; Novalles; Provence; Sainte-Croix; Tévenon; L'Abergement; Ballaigues; Baulmes; Juriens; Lignerolle; La Praz; Premier; Vallorbe; Vaulion; L'Abbaye; Le Chenit; Le Lieu; Vugelles-La Mothe; Boudry; Cortaillod; Rochefort; La Grande Béroche; La Chaux-de-Fonds; Les Planchettes; La Sagne; Les Brenets; La Brévine; Brot-Plamboz; Le Cerneux-Péquignot; La Chaux-du-Milieu; Le Locle; Les Ponts-de-Martel; Cressier (NE); Enges; Lignières; Val-de-Ruz; La Côte-aux-Fées; Les Verrières; Val-de-Travers; Boécourt; Bourrignon; Châtillon (JU); Courchapoix; Courrendlin; Courroux; Courtételle; Delémont; Develier; Mervelier; Rossemaison; Saulcy; Soyhières; Haute-Sorne; Val Terbi; Le Bémont (JU); Les Bois; Les Breuleux; La Chaux-des-Breuleux; Les Enfers; Les Genevez (JU); Lajoux (JU); Montfaucon; Muriaux; Le Noirmont; Saignelégier; Saint-Brais; Soubey; Clos du Doubs. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 218.62. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 383. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1650. The total population (in thousand) is 245.48. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 112.29. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.82%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 27254.85. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 26722.71. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 3534. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 3.79%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2267. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 48. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.02%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 52.16%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Other valorisation of the milk through the raw milk and direct sales, possibility to have a better price per litre for the farmer, prevalence of landuse systems through pasture (cattle grazing) in the swiss mountains. Raw milk is not a new product because it has always been consumed in this way in rural areas, but it can represent a new strategy for selling milk, more natural and above all sold directly (the consumer's desire to consume locally and not processed).   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest.    Conservation is a challenge since raw milk must be sold quickly as it cannot be stored at room temperature for several days. The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Raw milk is a return to earlier and traditional forms of milk, which may represent innovation as it stands out from contemporary and industrial milk consumption. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   The sale of raw milk takes place throughout Switzerland, mainly in the mountain regions near the grazing areas."
