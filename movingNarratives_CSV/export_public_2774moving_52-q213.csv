Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 CZ. The wood processing VC represent a classic example of economic activity that has been traditionaly pursued in the Sumava region. The VC currently include different economic actors - regional, national, State-owned, global that compete over the very specific assets. The regional actors that used to play very important role for the regional economy are facing high economic pressure. At the same time the VC is changing due to environmental challenges that are reflected in the forestry activities. The VC plays a crucial role in the mountain region, because it is directly and firmyl linked with the visible and tangible natural assets - forests. Functioning of this VC significantly affect environmental and economic aspects of the region with numerous indirect implication for other sectors (such as tourism).

Wood processing is a typical VC associated with the Sumava region. The VC directly utilizes rich natural resources (forests). Forestry and wood processing has been a traditional sources of livelihood for local inhabitants. The forests perform multiple functions in the region - spannig over environmental and economic functions. The ownership of forest land is fragmented, there are many owners of small forest plots and at the same time there are large companies. In the context of Sumava region it is important to note that the area of the national park and nature proteced area are owned and managed by the State-owned company.   Key assets stem from natural capital of the region (forestry - spruce trees). The wood processing is important part of the regional economy. It can be also counted a part of the regional culture and tradition. Some of these businesses have operated in the region for a very long time (about one century). These traditional (small) business are experiencing a rising economic pressure related to their productivity. This is also a reason why some of these business were not able to cope with the existing price pressure.    The VC is currently facing many challenges. (1) Due to the global climate change, the forests that are typical of the Sumava region (spruce) are suffering from shortage of water. The trees are more vulnarable and threatened by bark beetle that is destroying large areas of spruce forests. (2) Forest areas located in the national park are subject of a long-term discussion about sustainable management of these areas. (3) Local wood processers are open for international trade with Germany and Austria. Many local wood processors went bancrupt due to the economic pressure that is increasing in the sector. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC obviously crosses over the borders to Germany and Austria just like the mountain region. However, the actors of the given VC operate in a different economic and social context."
