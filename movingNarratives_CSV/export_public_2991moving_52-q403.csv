Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 SER. There are several big byersand processors of medical herbs in the area of South-East Serbia. In the area of Sokobanja, there is one big buyer and processor (Adonis) who is also educating collectors how to collect herbs and respect steps for their renewal and habitat protection. Medicinal and aromatic wildly grown herbs picked on the Rtanj and the mountain Ozren (second mountain of the Sokobanja area), which is on the opposite, southern side of Sokobanja, account for the majority of the Serbian export of these commodities, which in 2018 reached €3.3 millio. Herbs are collected manually, dried and packed in differnt unifloral or multifloral artisans. Adonis made an innovation in packaging tisanes,a nd they have developed e-commerce for people to buy their products. Tisanes are sold in different healthy food stores, small shops, restaurants, as well as big retail stores. There is a growing trend to cultivate medical herbs in organised groups of farmers, especially in the areas that are known as 'clean and healthy' areas.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia, Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Rtanj Mountain. Sokobanja is one of the most popular tourist resorts in Serbia. It is situated in the southern part of Sokobanja valley, surrounded by mountains Ozren, Devica, Janior, Rtanj, and Bukovik. The Moravica River runs through Sokobanja. It creates a canyon just 2 km before entering the town. Remains of the Roman and later medieval Serbian fortress Sokograd stand today near the canyon of Moravica. Sokobanja is thermal and air spa, and still has Turkish bath building for inhalation for asthmatic people. Spa dates since Roman times. The Moravica river was known for the clear water and the abundance of the crayfish. The 1945 edition of the Politika newspaper reports about the export of the crayfish from Sokobanja, stating that 'they were transported from Moravica by airplanes to Paris, London and Monte Carlo'. There is an artificial Lake Bovan on the Moravica to the west of Sokobanja. In the East part of Sokobanja, there is the Soko Grad - a medieval city and fortress declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance by Republic of Serbia. The fortress originates from the Roman, early Christian period. It was founded in the 6th century during the reign of Emperor Justinian I, to prevent incursions of Pannonian Avars and Slavs into the Balkan peninsula. In 1172, it was occupied by Stefan Nemanja and became part of the medieval Serbian state. Rtanj mountain is part of Sokobanja's turistic offer, together with villages on its slopes that are revitalised in last couple of years - Vrmdza village has become one of the popular places for living / many people from Serbia and abroad are moving to this village, bringin different activities with them.

Rtanj tea (Satureja montana/Winter Savory) is one of the most known medical herbs that are collected in the mountain of Rtanj. Rtanj is a mountain located in Eastern Serbia, approximately 200 km southeast of Belgrade, between the towns of Boljevac on north and Sokobanja (spa) on the south. It belongs to the Serbian Carpathians. Its highest peak is Šiljak (1,565 m), a natural phenomenon of karst terrain. This mountain is rich in different medical species that are of high quality. Collected and dried, medical herbs are used as tisanes, and are very important domestic and exporting product. The other very important plant that can be found on this mountain is Nepeta rtanjensis that belongs to the endangered species, and is protected by the state (as well as S. Montana). Nepeta rtenjsis is in the Red Book of Flora in Serbia. This plant is medical herb that contains etheric oil that is more efficient in fighting bacteria Staphylococcus aureus than penicillin and tetracycline. The area of Rtanj Mountain contain high percentage of iron in the rocks/soil, and because of this, Rtanj is attracting lightening. Besides this, the peak of the mountain has pyramidal shape. For both these reasons people give mystical power to the mountain, and there are many fantast stories and folk believes that this is magical mountain.One of the biggest producers of articans is Adonis from Sokobanja, who has certificate of HACCP, as well as other international standards, like GLK (Gütenachweis für Lebensmittel-Kleinbetriebe). Medical herbs are very important resource of Serbia. These herbs are available in mature, and many of them are on the list of protected and/or endangered plants. In previous years (especially during 90's, and high economic crisis) many people freely started to collect them and sell to the buyers, in order to obtain some income. This caused losing some habitats of medical herbs. On the other hand, buyers are making strong efforts to educate collectors in order to make medical herbs collection sustainable. Therefore, there is a strong need for wider understanding of the situation and support to the different groups, and ensuring habitats are protected and enlarged.   Sokobanja municipality is a very popular and well known spa in Serbia, focusing on respiratory problems, asthma (especially children asthma), as well as problems with eyes. Rtanj Mountain brings additional value to this context, due to its high content of medical herbs. This value is also connected to hiking tours, festival of medical herbs, and beekeeping that is performed in the area of Sokobanja and Rtanj Mountain.    Medical herbs from Rtanja Mountain (as well as from other mountains), are mostly collected by individual collectors that are not always following procedures for sustainable herb collection. This is, very often, job for people who have low income, or do not have other source of income. Therefore, the herb byers are making big efforts to organise educational workshop for collectors in order to have them collect herbs, but also do not destroy their natural habitats. In addition to this, free range grazing of animals is in collision with herb preservation, since animals also like to eat these herbs due to their pleasant smell, and their good taste. Other anthropogenic influences on these herbs are illegal construction and environment pollution. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Medical herbs are important source of income for many people, and Serbia is well known for high quality herbs. In old Yugoslavia there were many collection points, while herbs were used for consumption as tisanes, as well as for medicine, as etheric oils, natural cosmetics, etc. This inheritance is still present, but now processing is done mostly in the area of collection, or in other parts of Serbia, while in previous times, this added value activities were performed outside the borders. Many different new products are created in last couple of decades - from high quality oils, cosmetics, aromatherapy products, food products (honey with different medical herbs), etc. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   All mountain regions have the same VC, and very often herbs are collected in one region, and then packed and/or processed in other."
