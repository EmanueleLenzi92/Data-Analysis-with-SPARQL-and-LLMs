Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 43 IT. The VC depends only on the local SES. The main actors are the breeders and farmers who collaborate in the cooperative company to produce milk and cheeses. Quality certifications are used limited to the traditional productions of Friuli. The number of VC participants and the type of economic activity linked to the territory has a positive impact on the SES and the adoption of environmentally friendly production and processing methods.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Alps - Julian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Malborghetto Valbruna. Malborghetto Valbruna is a municipality in the Italian Province of Udine in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. It is located in in the mountainous region of the Julian Alps, about 50 kilometres Northeast of the regional capital Udine, on the border with Austria.   The size of the area (km2) is 124.21. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 624. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2680. The total population (in thousand) is 0.908.

The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 31200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 14844.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.94%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 29.15%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 68.91%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 31600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 34501. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.90%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.67%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 69.43%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 806. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.51%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 42. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 82. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.31%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.54%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 70.15%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.82%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.91%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.27%.   The dairy, owned by a local cooperative of farmers, collects and processes the milk produced by 24 local farmers to produce Italian and local cheeses. For the production of the traditional Friulian cheese called 'Montasio', the dairy obtained in 2011 the certification 'denomination product of origin (DPO) and 'mountain product' (MP) label. In this case, the VC is strongly linked to the natural (pasture, mountain, cows, etc.) and cultural (cheese production, mountain culture, etc.) elements of the SES. The dairy's products are traditional, and innovations include adopting quality certificates and some 'new products' (but based on the food local tradition). This guarantees a competitive advantage in the market. In the dairy shop, local cheeses and milk are offered, and various other products from local and regional producers. Some of these products use cheeses from dairy (e.g. 'Frico').   The SES is involved in the VC for several reasons. The grasslands and cultivated land are used for foraging dairy cattle (exclusively Italian Red Fleckvieh cattle). The cultural dimension is involved in the production skills related to traditional cheese making in the Friuli region. From a social viewpoint, cooperative organisational forms to face economic problems are common.    The market of dairy products is very competitive due to the presence of a wide variety of cheese. Product and process innovation is relevant for competitiveness, but this VC innovation appears limited to the acquisition of quality certificates (e.g. DPO and MP). Moreover, the dairy's reference market is local (the cooperative has its point of sale in Malborghetto Valbruna), where other typical products of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region are also proposed. Recently, home delivery sales have been adopted for a limited area. These elements could compromise the VC in the long term. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovations are two: first, acquiring certification that guarantees their cheeses as typical and quality products; second, the home sales practice. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
