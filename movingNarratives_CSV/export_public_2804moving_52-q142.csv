Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 FR. The olive growing is structured around a GI Oliu di Corsica (Interprofessional Union of Oléiculteurs de Corse). Corsica oil is defined from a double sensory identity: a sweet oil, ripe fruits, harvested with old-fashioned nets, taking advantage of old orchards with erect habit and an oil harvested on the tree from recent orchard plantations : slight ardency and bitternes.200 small to very small farms adhere to the GI. The threat of Xilella fastidiosa strongly impacts the representations that olive growers have of their future. It expresses global warming and globalization. Olive growing (like the chestnut tree) is the agricultural activity with the most impact on areas near mid-mountain villages and therefore a lever for their preservation and revitalization.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is île-rousse-Balagne. The value chain concerns the Balagna region emblematic of olive oil production in Corsica. Located in the north west of the island, it is a tourist region without any significant town and consisting of a Balcony village. It is constitued of 24 municipalities covering an area of 397.92 km2 grouped in two communities of municipalities.   The size of the area (km2) is 390. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2390. The total population (in thousand) is 0.1. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 26.7. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.00%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 3894. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3894. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 160. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   The relaunch of olive culture was based on the construction of a geographical indication that promotes local varieties and upright driving tree. The two oils identified ( old-fashioned harvest and on the tree ) mobilize original sensory characteristics highlighted by the professional organization that manages the GI. Today, the current dynamism of the sector is threatened by the disease linked to the bacterium Xilella fastidiosa and by global warming, which is the cause of increasingly frequent drought. The challenge is to rethink the sensory characteristics of Corsican oils in this new production context. Olive orchards cover a large part of the areas around mid-mountain villages but most often in wild form (oleaster). The revival of olive growing involves both landscaping and development as well as economic issues. The oil is a market product but also a food for the local populations. The current and future crises can accelerate the revival of activity towards the regeneration of old trees or even new plantations in the upper parts of the villages. These transformations towards mountain and domestic production raise the question of coexistence with the current value chain. For which oils (ripe fruit or harvest from the tree), which governance and which space occupations?.   Two directions are considered : to increase the irrigation levels of orchards and / or to orient plantations in mid-mountain areas with the risk of modifying sensory properties wich is the base of the value chain. The question is whether orchard management methods and local varieties will be able to face to this new context of production? And downstream, how customers will receive likely changes in taste. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation consisted in enhancing new sensorial characteristics such as 'green fruity' while local habit are founded on 'riped fruit' . This openness, which is based on harvesting fruit from the tree, (while the traditional harvest is done with a net) is linked to taste standards that are both commercial and due to european norms. The tasting training within the framework of GIs has accompanied innovation. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are reappropriation and control of the space around the villages and fight against fires. The local assets include Social and cultural.   Similar VC was identified in other MRls, in Czech Republic, Hungary, North Macedonia."
