Wine growing is the 2nd largest agricultural activity of Savoyard agriculture, after milk production. In Jongieux are located 6 commercial wine producers, making wine under Vins de Savoie Jongieux cru and Rousette de Savoie Marestel cru denomination. 5% of wine is exported and this number is growing. From 1999 the Association Coteuax Jongieux et Marestel is helping wine growers to reconstruct historical vineyards on the higher altitudes. Jongieux is attractive for wine and gastronomic tourists, it is the part of official touristic itinerary Route des Vins de Savoie.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Rhône-Alpes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Jongieux. Jongieux is a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France. It is also a named cru of the Vin de Savoie appellation.The village of Jongieux lies 12km east of the town of Belley, on the western slopes of the Mont du Chat mountain ridge, overlooking the Rhône river. The vineyards of the appellation stretch up the mountainside, reaching altitudes as high as 500m above sea level.   The size of the area (km2) is 6.43.

The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 152. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 7.90%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 20508. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13489.48. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.07%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 27153. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 202065.11. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.00%.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.70%.   During the 20th century the surface area of Savoyard vineyards was drastically reducted. In the 2000-s new generations of vine growers started the reconquest, with the reconstruction of vineyards that have disappeared in the mountains and on the steepest slopes.   The village high quality produces wines from Altesse (unique local variety existing only on this territory) which are sold under the Roussette de Savoie appellation (specifically under the Marestel cru title). The highest slopes of coteaux Marestel above the village have excellent soil characteristics and mesoclimate for the late-ripening, low-yielding Altesse variety.    The main challenge was to reconstruct from zero the 25 ha of vineyard on the steep slope (50-60%) of the coteaux Marestel, historically known as a good spot for high quality wine production, which was abandoned due to the demographic dynamics of the 20Th century and due to the difficulties connected to the mountain wine production (manual work, steep slopes). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and vineyards. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
