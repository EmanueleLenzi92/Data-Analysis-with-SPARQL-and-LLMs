Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 UK. Dinorwig power station (or Electric Mountain) is a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme in Snowdonia National Park (Gwynedd LAU1). Water is stored in an upland lake/reservoir on the mountain and sent through the turbines to create hydro-electric power when needed. It can provide power for up to six hours from full and has an energy storage capacity of 9.1 (GWh). It is also designed to support the National Grid restart in instances of power outage. Electric mountain is also a tourist attraction with 132,000 visitors annually, to the visitor centre and opporturnity to tour the power station. The benefits of pumped hydro-electric power are not always clearly recognised given the high initial construction costs.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is West Wales (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Gwynedd. Gwynedd, in north west Wales, is most known for its spectacular mountain, lake and forest scenery, which features Snowdonia National Park and the highest mountain in Wales. The area is relatively isolated but is well-connected to north Wales and north west England by road and rail. The largest settlement, Bangor, is a small university city.   The size of the area (km2) is 2548.075142. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1085. The total population (in thousand) is 124.56. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 48.88. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.50%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 150.68. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.33%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18362.69. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2990.81. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.36%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.76%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.88%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 18518.64. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 40269.69. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.25%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.14%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 71.61%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 125126. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 32.01%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2171. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 110. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.08%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 13.56%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 81.36%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.13%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 20.10%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.76%.   There are still only four pumped storage hydropwer projects in the UK but they have potential in generating 2800MW. These are located in Scotland and Wales and are an important renewable energy source. Electric Mountain in located in Gwynedd LAU1 and is the largest scheme. It also is home to many rare bird spieces including perregrine falcons. Also its dual purpose as a tourist attraction and source of renewable energy production and the impacts on the surrounding scenery (although attempts have been made to minimse these impacts). Dinorwig/ Electric Mountain has been referred to as 'the UK's largest battery' and it is the largest scheme of its kind in Europe.   Key local assets are natural and social. Natural assets are the necessity of water/ rainfall for the energy to be produced. Also important is the power station having minimal impact on the surroudnign scenery and landscape given it is built within Snowdonia National Park. Social assets are the need for good working and community relationships between and across staff, community memebrs, national park officials, farmers and other land managers and local community members to ensure good cooperation. Electric Mountain have also set up and sponsored multiple local groups such as a slare Museum and a hiking trail. They also sponsor local events including the Snowdonia Marathon.    Electric mountain faced challenges in how to ensure protection of a local rare fish (Welsh Arctic Charr). These fish were subsequently moved. Impacts if climate change imapcts on the amount of water gathered in the reservoir to make hydro-electric power. The surrounding land is also open access leading to necessary good relations between hikers etc and Electric Mountain staff. It is also built within Snowdonia National Park and so there are potential challenges between conflicting interests of the land/ scenery. Finanacial justification of pumped hydro-electric schemes can be hard to justify, especially with moved to cleaber ebergy production. The visitor centre/ tour are currently closed due to renovation representing a reduced income from tourism. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. traditional as pumped hydro-electric is not a new activity. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land and upland mountainous lakes. The local assets include Natural and social.   Although Electric mountain is the largest pumped hydroelectric scheme in the UK, others do exist including Ffestiniog Station (also in Gwynedd LAU1), Cruachan (Argyll and Bute, LAU1), Foyers (Inverness and Nairn, LAU1). Others are currently proposed or being built including in Lochaber LAU1 and Badenoch and Strathspey."
