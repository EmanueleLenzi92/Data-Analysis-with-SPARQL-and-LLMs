There are over 130 distilleries producing whisky across Scotland. Scotch Whisky is a PDO, in which 'Scotch' has to be distilled and matured in Scotland. There are many distilleries within Badenoch and Strathspey LAU1. Whisky production is dependent on clean water, peat and barley. More recently the whisky industry has become intertwinned with tourism, for instance, within Badenoch and Strathspey there is the Malt Whisky Trail on which 14 distilleries can be reached. Official tours can also be undertaken within and between distilleries. There are also new tourism ventures such as Whisky Festcials (i.e., Speyside).

Scotch Whisky has PDO status and is highly regarded around the world. Exports are worth £4.9 billion and accounted for 75% of all Scottish food and drink exports for 2019. the industry provides £5.5billion GVA to the UK economy and directly employs more than 10,000 people and indirectly more than 40,000 people. Iconic for territorial identity and Scotland's high reputation for food and drink tourism. Scotch Whisky assocation have also committed to net-zero emmissions by 2040 through its new sustainability strategy. The tourism experience connected to whisky distilleries is innovatvie in terms of new products (a visit to a distillery/ whisky trail) and new marketing strategies (i.e. whisky experience holidays and food and drink tourism).   Natural assets are clean water, peat and barley. Also important is the land for scenery (important for promoting the whisky distilleries to wider tourist market). Social assets are good relationships across the value chain including distillery workers, farmers, land owners, local communities and tourists. Cultural assets are the cultural heritage intertwinned with the whisky industry (i.e. whisky is iconic for Scotland), and also traditional knowledge for distilling practices.    Relies on climate than produces clean water, and good quality peat and barley - so may be impacted by climate change. Also BREXIT and COVID can and may impact on the export market and the tourism revenue. Negative impacts of whisky industry (i.e. alcoholism). It may also be a challenge to achieve net-zero by 2040. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. whisky production itself is not innovative, but the tourism connection/ experience is new and innovative. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Natural land and clean water. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Whisky VCs can interact with many other tourism/ experience VCs e.g. highland cattle, hillwalking, agritousim, but also produce, water and peat VCs. Many whisky distilleries are also venturing into gin production in addition. Scotch Whisky is produced all across Scotland including Skye and Lochalsh, West Moray and Argyll and Bute Islands LAU1 areas. Whisky is produced in Northern Ireland too (Bushmills Whiskey) but this is not within a mountain area."
