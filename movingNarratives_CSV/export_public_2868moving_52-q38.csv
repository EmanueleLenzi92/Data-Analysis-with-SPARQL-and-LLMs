The farm took the opportunity offered by Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and Reg.(UE) n.665/2014 to use the label ' Mountain Product'. The innovation start to spread also in this very traditional value chain. The idea to close the supply chain was ,otiveted by the ruduction of quality agricoltural products.   An organic production of cereals and a Bakery done following the dictates of bio-architecture, and using photovoltaics combined with a heat pump to produce the energy necessary for the process.    From a classic bakery to a farm that have close the supply chain starting form the production of cereals to the processing of breads. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The production of bread is done mixing an innovative process with traditional products. To improve the innovative process the owner have visit different bakeries in France and Germany with the idea to produce bread with self made grains and sourdough. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Bioarchiteute, Sustainability, Organic farm, Quality."
