The farm produce organic eggs and took the opportunity offered by Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and Reg.(UE) n.665/2014 to use the label ' Mountain Product'. We have choose this producer for the hight specialisation in one specific sector and for the high innovation technologies use to collect the egges.   The tavernola farm is a specilisated farm in the eggs production. The farm have about 30 worker used in the differt phases of the process. This is the main aspect that have a deeper relashionship with the local asset. For a small mountain community a far with 30 employee is very important for the local economies.    The market of eggs is very competitive but this farm have decide to follow all the change in the market demand. The high innovation technologies use to collect the eggs and the high knowledge in the sector can help to increase the productivities and remain competitive. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. A close supply chain with the production of different qualities of egges following the market demand. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are There is not a specific land use link to the production of eggs, there are some indirect land use, as cropland, for the production of feed mill. The local assets include Cultural."
