Successful local integration of small traditional cabbage producers by a slightly larger local producer, who organises logistics, storage, processing and trading of the products. They have become part of the local territorial quality assurance system (European Territorial Quality Mark). Cabage is a very traditional product for mountain agriculture in the region, however traditional producers are on the verge of extintion due to marketing problems and large scale competition. The only way forward seems to be integration, of which this is an excellent example.   Very good conditions (weather, soil) and a long cultural tradition of cabbage production. The presence of human capacity to organise logistics and achieve economies of scale. Available technology for storage and logistics (based on a 'recicled processing and storage plant of a multi-national company) Good connections with the local LEADER LAG, organising marketing and community action.    Difficult communication between producers, finding markets, challenges in connection with climate change (draughts, extreme weather events, etc.), maintaining interest of producers in participating in the local producers' networks, etc. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. An indigenous local producer managed to integrate small producers in and around the municipality, create the necessary high technology infrastructure for logistics and storage and create a considerable volume from a traditional product, enough to approach larger markets. + participation in the ETQM - social innovation, etc. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
