Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 RO. The Lotru-Ciunget HydroElectric Power Station is a complex of three hydroelectric power plants constructed over a period of 17 years 1965 to 1982 . The first and most productive is an underground plant at Ciunget powered by water from Vidra Lake (one of the biggest artificial lakes in Romania with a 140 metre high clay core dam) via an 800 metre drop underground pipe. All the used water is recollected via an underground piping system and flows to the Malaia dam where is there is an aboveground power plant. Malaia dam is a smaller dam and the power plant produces less electricity. From the second dam, the used water collects into the Bradisor dam. This final dam is larger and supplies another larger capacity underground power plant. The total installed capacity of the three power plants is 510 MW and they supply around 1.15 billion kW·hours of electricity per year.to the Romanian national grid.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Malaia commune in Vâlcea County (RO415). The relief of Vâlcea County (RO415) is around one-third mountain area in the north of the county with a mixed land cover of forest and semi-natural grasslands. Two mountain groups dominate the region - the Făgăraș Mountains in the east with heights over 2,200 m and the Lotru Mountains in the west with heights over 2,000 m. These are separated by the Olt River valley (one of the most accessible routes through the Southern Carpathians), along which there are smaller groups of mountains - the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains. The central region of the county is sub-mountainous hilly area with a diverse mosaic landscape of fruit orchards, vineyards and semi-natural grasslands - and in the south there is high plain area cultivated with cereals and vegetables.   The size of the area (km2) is 392.4. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 1.799. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 4.58. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 66.9. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.17%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2652.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 38.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 8100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 14241.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 7.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.70%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 11526. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 63.10%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 119190. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 34.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 28.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 36.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 38.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 34.50%.   Hydroelectricity is the 2nd most important source of electicity in Romania after fossil fuels and contributes around one-third of the national energy mix. There are a total of 220 hydropower stations in Romania with a significant number (of varying capacity) in the mountain areas. The majority (209) are managed by the state-owned 'Hidroelectrica' company (https://www.hidroelectrica.ro/). The Vidra Lake and the Lotru-Ciunget Dam and Hydro Power Plant are located on the Lotru River near Malaia commune (171021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). It is the most important facility managed by 'Hidroelectirca' and is one of the biggest hydroelectric complexes in Europe.   The Lotru River fills the three dams in the hydroelectric complex. It's source is in the Parâng Mountain group in the central Southern Romanian Carpathians.    Romania has significant energy resources and hydro-electricity from the mountain areas has historically been of great importance both to the country's economy and to its security policy. This will obviously continue with the trend towards decarbonisation of the energy sector and increased focus on renewables. The immediate challenge for the state-owned Hidroelectrica is adjusting to the recently liberalised (from 1 January, 2021) market for electricity in Romania and the need to compete for customers now faced with a diverse offer of prices and contractual conditions from a broad range of different suppliers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural."
