Graviera is a PDO cheese of Crete, famous among Greek cheeses. In the Amari area, at the western slopes of Psiloritis Mountain, free-range sheep and goat breeding is the predominant activity. The native flora of the area contributes to the aromatic and rich in fat milk, mainly used for traditional dairy products in family level. Recently a new business endeavour by a famous local cheesemaker in the village of Kalogerou-Amari has been undertaken, aiming to revive the cheesemaking as a small industry and re-introduce the well established cheese in gastronomy. Graviera of Amari is a product of high quality, great reputation and territorial identity in the area of Kalogerou / Amari. The activity has offered a new perspective for the area. The new types of graviera can give a boost in the consumption of the specific label, making the products more attractive, gaining new target groups of consumers. All these innovative products require innovative making cheese processes due to co-existing different materials, mainly in the stage of riping. The innovative use of whey in the feed of animals needs extra knowledge of breeders giving the possibility to reduce the cost of the feeding, improving the quality of the raw materials (milk and meat) and reducing the environmental foot-printing in a environmentaly sensitive area. The breeding of sheep and goats in the mountainous areas and the utilization of the mountain pastures is a traditional activity that is closely connected with the locals, theri families and theris social activities. The cheesemaking has been a traditionan, family business, carried out on special stone constructions, the mitata (constructions dating from the Minoan Civilization in 1600 BC), making it a social model and a way of life. The picturesque and under developed valley of Amari, along with the traditional way of life, draws the attention of many visitors throughout the year. In the wider area of Amari many cultural events take place: concerts, theatrical performances, traditional dancing events, exhibitions, local gastronomy, ethics, excursions, workshops, education, art, culture and much more, a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the authentic traditions of Crete. The local authorities as well as the Region of Crete have been trying hard to support sustainable development in Amari with an emphasis on the preservation of the natural environment and cultural heritage. In the green fertile valley of Amari, surrounded by the mountains of Kedros, Samitos and Psiloritis the village of Kalogerou is the place where the cheesemaking endeavour of the area is located. The area is of special natural beauty, scattered with many small, picturesque villages that retain their traditional colour. Sheep / goat breeding keeps the traditional way in livestock in the mountainous pastures of Amari.The main product of the activity is milk, which faces problems in disposal and has become economically unprofitable for the producers, who are heavily dependent on European subsidies to survive. Animal infections and climate change increase the uncertainty and vulnerability of the pastoral activities. Their hard life and the economic uncertainty is deterrent for the young people of the area, which leads to a quick decline of the local population. Although graviera, an established, high priced cheese could become a solution for the disposal of the local milk, the strong competition form local, national and international products makes the endeavour challenging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. In recent years, at the request of the consumers and gastronomers, there is a trend for enriched types of graviera, mixed with aromatic plants and spices. The cheesemaking of Amari tries to gain an advantage in a demanding market by introducing such new types of graviera, along with the traditional one. The activity is trying to increase its presence and reputation through the social media. Another innovation is the use of whey in the feed of animals, which has been introduces lately as an initiative of the Region of Crete, with promising results. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. In Crete, Graviera cheese is produced all over the island by small family firms and big cooperatives. Graviera is produced in many other areas of Greece and is a typical dairy product. In addition in the EU katalog there three more types of Graviera like Agrafa/Epirus (30% goat and 70% sheep milk) or the island of Naxos (mainly cow's milk 80% and sheep and goat milk)."
