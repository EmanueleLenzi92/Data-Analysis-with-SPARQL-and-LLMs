Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SLOVENIA VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 SL. Several farmers of the valley produce organic and biodynamic grapes from autochthonous varieties and process them into several wine types (certified organic/biodynamic) but a specific wine type they produce is orange wine (white grape must macerated on skins). This wine type got high attention on international markets and became a driver of local viticulture on high quality wines markets. The production is based on a group of independent wine-makers, owning small scale farms.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Karst Plateau. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ajdovščina. the Karst plateau and the related valleys are located in proximity of highly populated areas but preserved a special level of wilderness. Forests are highly present, agriculture still plays a relevant role (also thanks to many part-time farmers or hobby farmers), high mountains (Triglav) are nearby. Besides, Slovenian population is very keen to sport ad outdoor activities (trekking, kayaking,biking) and as a consequence these are not only assets for tourism but also for residents quality of life.   The size of the area (km2) is 245. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 100. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1100. The total population (in thousand) is 19.2. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 79. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.60%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 50.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.40%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 1668.23. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 47402.11. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 41.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 12462. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 47402.11. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 41.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 55.80%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 69902. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 56.50%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 1.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 56.50%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 42.00%.   1. Karst is a peculiar mountain landscape; 2. the orange wines value chain developed spontaneously as a retro-innovation; 3. the international acknowledgment of orange wines pushed for a fast development of organic and biodynamic viticulture in the area (part of the innovation). 1) peculiarity of the Karst area; 2) grass-root development, largely unguided, development of the successful value chain; 3) climate change high risk.   1. environmental: organic viticulture can well fit with the high quality landscape and contribute to its maintenance. 2. Cultural: orange wines, autochthonous varieties and organic viticulture are partly retro-innovation, based on local culture and skills.    1) competition of other economic sectors; 2) economic sustainability in the long run; 3) climate change will probably affect the area and compel changes in the agricultural practices . Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Viticulture is traditional in the area but under the Socialist period I was not allowed to private farmers to process the grape into wine individually. Wine-making could develop in the 90s but since the start local small scale winegrowers looked for more natural methods. Organic and Biodynamics viticulture and the use of autochthonous grape varieties started to gain more and more space and interest among private cellars. At the same time a retroinnovation process started, with the technically reviewed practice of white grapes must maceration on skins, in order to obtain oxidized wines, named orange wines, due to their color. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland and grape for wine production. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   it is a quite specific situation: small country, special valley on the border with Italy and close to the sea, special type of wine, produced in small quantity in small farms but with an international market."
