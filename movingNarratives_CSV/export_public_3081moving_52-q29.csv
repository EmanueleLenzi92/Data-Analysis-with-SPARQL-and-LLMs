Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 ES. The place where the goats sleep and graze is the same as the cheese production, all happens in the same farm. The goats are milked every day and the milk is sent to a lab for analysis.

High quality goat cheese from the autochthonous goat breed florida andaluza. The goats have grazed along these natural pastures for centuries, being totally connected with this land use and enabling this way its natural maintenance. It is an innovation in the waste management mostly.   1) The scarce amount of herds of this goat breed compromises its continuity and its beneficial effects on the social-ecological-system 2) Competing with the industrially-produced cheese; 3) expanding the selling scope beyond the province. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation to point out is related to the energy use and waste management. The farm uses solar energy for its functioning. The wasted water is treated with bioremediation in an artificial pond nearby. Afterwards, the water is used in the family garden. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Animal skin / leather. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There are other goat cheese producers in Sierra Morena. Another case can be found in Guarromán (23039) where the familiar company 'Besos y Quesos' is following similar cheese making but with goats of the Malagueña breed."
