Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 RO. Farming in the Bran commune is traditionally a form of small-scale semi-subsistence pastoralism and many of these farming households have diversified into some form of 'agro-touristc farm' (ATF). The concept of ATFs was promoted first in the mid-1990s by Law 145 / 1994 defining a national strategy for development of a rural tourism industry in the mountains. At the same time a National Association for Rural Tourism, Ecology and Culture (ANTREC) was set-up in Bran to channel EU pre-accession funds into the rural tourism sector. ATFs were required to conform with the requirements of the 1994 Law, to register with their local council and to join ANTREC as a means of accessing training, information, advice and possible funding. ANTREC were responsible for developing a brand image for rural and mountain tourism and administering a centralised reservation system and quality rating scheme. Although the market has diversified considerably in recent years, ANTREC (https://www.antrec.ro/) still remains a key actor in the value chain for mountain tourism in the Bran area - as well as operating nationally with 16 regional branches and 2,500 members. ANTREC is now based in Bucharest.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Bran commune in Braşov county (RO122). Braşov county is a hilly mountainous region (500 - 2000 metres altitude) located in the south-eastern part of Transylvania. The relief is a diverse mix of mountainous (35%), hilly (50%) and lower altitude plain areas (15%) with an associated land use of forests (mainly in the mountain areas), permanent grasslands (mainly in the hilly areas), cultivated arable fields (in the hilly areas and lower altitude plains and hill areas) plus some urban, industrial and water surfaces (lakes and reservoirs).

Mountain tourism in the Carpathians is typically all-season with similar visitor numbers in both winter and summer. There is a wide variety of accomodation available (both catered and self-catering) and an increasingly diverse range of leisure pursuits available. Bran commune in Braşov county has been one of several 'hotspots' for mountain tourism in Romania for many years and it remains typical of the low- to mid-range tourism experience offered in many regions catering primarily for the Romanian market with some international visitors.   Bran Castle sits in a beautiful mountain landscape between the Bucegi Natural Park and Piatra Craiului National Park. It is internationally famous for its supposed links with Vlad the Impaler who is widely regarded as the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Count Dracula. Consequently Bran Castle is commonly known as 'Dracula's Castle' and is a huge tourist attraction! The mountain landscape is highly appreciated by visitors - as is the temperate climate in summer. As the importance of agriculture and forestry for rural employment have declined many local small-holdings have diversified into offering traditional local food, accomodation and some recreational activities - so-called 'agro-touristic farms' (ATFs) that serve both seasonal and weekend visitors .    The Bran area offers a significant number of attractions for tourists, but the pattern of development during the last 30 years has come to threaten its future viability and sustainability as an attractive and profitable tourist destination. Bran is very well located and easily accessible with relatively good infrastructure. It has developed as a multi-purpose recreational resource with some relatively good accomodation / restaurants combined with a proliferation of rustic-styled 'agro-touristic' farms and second homes (the majority of which are newly constructed). Consequently the traditional rural identity of the area has become lost to an 'urban-type' over-development which increasingly discourages foriegn visitors whilst still appealing to the domestic visitor. A major challenge is how to manage continued development without further negative impact upon its valuable assets. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
