Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 UK. South Lakeland includes much of the Lake District National Park (and UNESCO World Heritage Site), including all of the land higher than 3,000ft in England, the country's highest mountain (Scafell Pike, 928m/3209ft) and largest lake (Windermere). The area s landscape and geological features support a range of activities based on their remarkability (e.g. rock climbing, abseiling, canyoning, gorge walking, high-wire crossings) and employment of expert instructors and guides in their provision. Adventure experience days provide adrenaline-fuelled and place-based access for tourism and other markets in the country's 'outdoor capital' -- recent thematic campaigns are also strengthing the region's assocation with adventure activities. Economic value associated with the adventure tourism market is also strongly linked to leisure, accomodation, hospitality and other tourism facilities in the area. Tourism is worth £2.44 billion to the Cumbrian economy (2015); 16% of all trips to North-West England involve some form of outdoor activity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cumbria (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is South Lakeland. South Lakeland is in the north-west of England and is partly within the Lake District National Park, an internationally renowned area for recreation and tourism. The area has a mixed landscape of mountains, hills, lakes, lowlands and coast and is accessible for large numbers of people in the north of England, with good road and rail links. Upland areas have a tradition of hill farming and sheep grazing, although the tourism industry is very important particularly in 'honeypots'.   The size of the area (km2) is 1553.032017. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 902. The total population (in thousand) is 105.088. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 67.67. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.33%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 73.29. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.04%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 24595.08. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 7703.09. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.88%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.63%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 74.50%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 23071.73. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13507.25. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.34%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 30.69%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 66.96%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 53310. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 68.02%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1198. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 36.4. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.11%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.81%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 78.08%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.54%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 24.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 72.05%.   Prevalence of outdoor adventure companies and promotion of the area as England's 'outdoor capital'. Adrenaline-based experiences generate economic value from landscape features and local knowledge to negotiate safe access. Recreational access to mountain areas based on adrenaline-based activities is not necessarily new in itself, but it would traditionally be reliant on purchase of equipment and accumulation of experience. Commodification provides novices and recreationalists with opportunities in the context of tourism, as an important component of South Lakeland as a mountain destination, and experience days are also as an increasingly significant in the context of corporate team-building and outdoor education for local and domestic markets.   Landscape features that support outdoor activities (including peaks, valleys, cliffs, gorges, lakes, caves, scree) and attract tourism markets (scenery); cultural knowledge associated with place and practice of mountain-based pursuits to support and commodify access for novice and tourism markets.    Carrying capacity/environmental impacts associated with access. Impact on experience-value associated with volume of visitors. Access via private land/conflict with land owners/managers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Experience days enable tourism access to adventure activities that require high levels of experience and awareness of health and safety requirements. Companies supply the equiment (often highly technical) and commodify knowledge and experience (including local/cultural knowldge of place) through provision of instruction and guidance to visitor markets. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Other LAU1 areas strongly associated with adventure tourism and experience days in the UK include Lochaber (particularly the Nevis Range), Badenoch and Strathspey (based around Aviemore and Cairngorm), and Perth and Kinross (based around Dunkeld in the southern Highlands) in Scotland, and Gwynedd and Conwy (Snowdonia National Park) in Wales."
