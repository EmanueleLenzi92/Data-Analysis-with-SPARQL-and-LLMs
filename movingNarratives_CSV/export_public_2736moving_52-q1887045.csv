Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 BG. To ensure the sustainable use of medicinal plant resources in the Central Balkan National Park (i.e. to keep them available for extraction without endangering their locations or depleting their stocks) specific rules and restrictions are enforced . Medicinal plants can be widely gathered for personal use within the Park provided that basic regulations and standards are observed, but commercial extraction is only allowed within a clearly defined 'Multifunctional Zone'.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Central Stara Planina (Balkan Mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Gabrovo Municipality in Gabrovo Province (BG322). Gabrovo Province (BG322) is a small province lying on the northern slopes of the Central Stara Planina mountain range with altitudes up to around 1,500 metres. The mountain landscape is open, rugged and very scenic - approximately 50% semi-natural and alpine grasslands and 50% broadleaf and mixed forest, including ancient beech, spruce, fir, oak and hornbeam.   The size of the area (km2) is 555.6. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 57.625. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 103.72. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 53.10. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.13%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 6900. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 655. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 46.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 48.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3730. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 8.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 33.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 58.20%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2895. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 29.00%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 6880. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 46.10%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.40%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 25.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 29.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 44.70%.   Wild-growing medicinal plants are a major renewable resource of Bulgaria and they are an important traditional export product which is well placed on international markets. A special regime for the protection and use of wild medicinal plants has been in place for almost 30 years and the National Park Authorities play an important role in its implementation. This value chain is focused upon the Central Balkan National Park which is one of the most important collection areas in Bulgaria. The Park touches upon the territory of five provinces and is administered by the Park Directorate based in Gabrovo Municipality (GAB05) in Gabrovo Province (BG322).   Wild-growing medicinal plants are a major renewable resource of Bulgaria. A total of 166 medicinal plant species (12 are protected by law) have been identified in the Central Balkan National Park, representing three-fourths of all medicinal plants widely used in alternative medicine. Particularly common species include thyme, St. John s wort, raspberry, wild strawberry, eyebright, common speedwell, cowslip, and mouse-ear hawkweed. Hazelbush, ramsons, common geranium, and woodruff-asperule flourish in wooded areas. Mullein, broad- and narrow-leaf plantain, nettle, milfoil, common tansy, and common wormwood are found in high mountain pastures and along trails, chalets, lodges, shelters, and other areas of increased human presence. Siberian juniper, black and cranberry are common species in the subalpine zone.    The main challenges with wild collected foods (herbs, berries or mushrooms), especially when working with large networks of (often untrained) collectors, are: a) correctly identifying the relevant species / type; b) avoiding contamination (e.g. with soil or other species); c) maintaining a consistent standard of quality, and; d) sustainable harvesting to ensure the continued viability of the harvested populations. Unsustainable harvesting and overexploitation of the most accessible sites is a major problem in Bulgaria and there have been several initiatives and communication campaigns to address this. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
