Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 CH2. Alpine Gruyère is produced seasonally from April to October in 53 alpine chalets. Gruyère production is organised by the Gruyère Interprofession created in 1997 who brings together milk producers, cheese makers and ripeners and thus guarantees the quality and identity of Gruyère.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corgémont; Cormoret; Cortébert; Courtelary; La Ferrière; Mont-Tramelan; Orvin; Renan (BE); Romont (BE); Saint-Imier; Sonceboz-Sombeval; Sonvilier; Tramelan; Villeret; Sauge; Péry-La Heutte; Belprahon; Champoz; Corcelles (BE); Court; Crémines; Eschert; Grandval; Loveresse; Moutier; Perrefitte; Reconvilier; Roches (BE); Saicourt; Saules (BE); Schelten; Seehof; Sorvilier; Tavannes; Rebévelier; Petit-Val; Valbirse; La Neuveville; Nods; Plateau de Diesse; Bullet; Concise; Fiez; Fontaines-sur-Grandson; Grandevent; Mauborget; Mutrux; Novalles; Provence; Sainte-Croix; Tévenon; L'Abergement; Ballaigues; Baulmes; Juriens; Lignerolle; La Praz; Premier; Vallorbe; Vaulion; L'Abbaye; Le Chenit; Le Lieu; Vugelles-La Mothe; Boudry; Cortaillod; Rochefort; La Grande Béroche; La Chaux-de-Fonds; Les Planchettes; La Sagne; Les Brenets; La Brévine; Brot-Plamboz; Le Cerneux-Péquignot; La Chaux-du-Milieu; Le Locle; Les Ponts-de-Martel; Cressier (NE); Enges; Lignières; Val-de-Ruz; La Côte-aux-Fées; Les Verrières; Val-de-Travers; Boécourt; Bourrignon; Châtillon (JU); Courchapoix; Courrendlin; Courroux; Courtételle; Delémont; Develier; Mervelier; Rossemaison; Saulcy; Soyhières; Haute-Sorne; Val Terbi; Le Bémont (JU); Les Bois; Les Breuleux; La Chaux-des-Breuleux; Les Enfers; Les Genevez (JU); Lajoux (JU); Montfaucon; Muriaux; Le Noirmont; Saignelégier; Saint-Brais; Soubey; Clos du Doubs. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 213.62. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 383. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1650. The total population (in thousand) is 233.02. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 109.08. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.86%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 27208.44. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 26547.39. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 3478. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 3.73%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2159. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 48. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.91%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 43.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 51.97%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Emblematic swiss cheese, known and epxorted world wide, high quality product with a international high reputation, successful registration of a quality scheme with a PDO, connected to cattle farming which is the main farming system in Switzerland (representative of swiss agriculture).   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest. Cheese production allows to value milk (produced in large quantities on a national scale) and maintain this landscape and its biodiversity. Gruyère production is furthermore based on traditional and historical know-how.    The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Alpine Gruyère is also produced in the Swiss Alps, but the mountain reference landscape only takes into account the Jura Mountain."
