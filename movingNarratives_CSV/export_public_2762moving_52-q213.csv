Local product (with reigonal label) utilizes the producsts (herbs) of remote mountain area in Czechia. The employees of social entreprise harvest the herbs and the enterprise developed e-shop to deliver healing herbal teas. The origin of social enterprise was supported by EU funds and employs 3 peope from socially disadvantageous groups (ethnic minority of Romas who are typified by high unemployment and who are concentrated in remote areas like this one). The chain demonstrates how remote mountain areas which are considered as backward (underdeveloped) benefit from local assets. The founders of VC reflected growing market demands as for natural products which are provided by clean nature of the mountains. They utilize regional label guaranteeing also sustainabllity principles. VC uses 'the past' (herbs were used for centuries for healing) to change practices of 'today' toward natural producrs The chain is typified by multi-actor-perspective (e.g. municipality of the company is partner).   Local medows with herbs far from any source of pollution. (max 300 characters).    Social inclusion through harvesting elderberies, nettles, plantain used in pupular healing medicine (simple work skills are needed to utilise mountain researouces such as herbs). Utilising local resources (their uniqueness) to promomte remote mountain areas and utilise its resources. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The innovation turns disadvanages (remoteness, social exclusion - were taken as 'business as usuall) into advantages (providing the marked with demanded natural healing herbs through the involvement of disadvanatgeous social groups - it is the novelty appraoch). Products which were used in the past by local people for healing purposes are revitalized now to be utilized under 'new concept' of health (a sort of retro-innovation). The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Social and cultural.   The company also produces herbs syrups, apple vinegard and also baked tea (tea is not local) - it means the small company with 5 emplyees goes also beyond the locality of Jeseniky/Rychlebske mountains."
