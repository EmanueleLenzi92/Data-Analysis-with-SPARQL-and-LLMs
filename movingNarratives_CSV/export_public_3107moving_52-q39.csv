Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 1. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 CH1. There is one major beer brand ('Appenzellerbier') that uses barley from the mountain regions, as well as many smaller breweries producing many types of beer. However, the production of barley (and other beer grains) in the Swiss mountain regions is not sufficient to cover all beer production, and part is imported. There are efforts to increase the amount of beer grain produced in the Swiss mountains.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is unspecified. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is unspecified.   The size of the area (km2) is unspecified. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is unspecified. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   innovative use of mountain grain, using traditional grain varieties. craft beers have become popular only in the last max. 10 years in switzerland, innovative way of using locally adapted produce, marketed towards younger customers than more traditional alpine products.   potentially problematic when water becomes scarce. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. first there was a label for grains produced in the mountains and then this led to finding new ways of using the barley, hence different 'mountain beers' were born, however, not yet enough grain produciton in the swiss alps and part is imported. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
