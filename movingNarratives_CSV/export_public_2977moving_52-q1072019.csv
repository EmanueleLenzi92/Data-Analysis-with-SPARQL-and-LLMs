Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 UK. 51% of Wales' energy is met by renewables (2019) and two thirds of this is through wind (both on and offshore turbeins). Pen y Cymoedd windfarm is the highest altitude windfarm in the UK. It is an onshore winfarm of 76 turbines located within Neath and Port Talbot, and was opened in 2017. It is capable of producing enough electricity to power 15% of homes in Wales annually. Its construction (three years) created more than 1000 local jobs, and it now supports 100 jobs. It supports the local community through a £1.8 million annual fund and is responsible for launching the Lost Peatlands Project (one of Southern Britain's largest Peatland projects. There is open-access to the wind turbine land so it is also enjoyed and shared by walkers and cyclists. However, the development was objected and campaaigned against by several local community and conservation groups because of the potential impacts on the scenery and peatland (hence the community fund agreement).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is West Wales (NUTS 2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Neath Port Talbot. Neath and Port Talbot in situated in the South of Wales on the coast, close to Swansea. It stretches from the coast to the border with the Brecon Beacons National Park. There is urban development along the south of the MRL (e.g. Neath and Port Talbot) and a large amount of upland area towards the north, mainly covered by forestry. Although the population of the area declined throughout the 20th century, there has been population growth in the 21st century. Employment and economic activity rates for the area are lower than the Welsh average.   The size of the area (km2) is 442.335437. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 600. The total population (in thousand) is 143.315. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 324.00. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.46%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 150.68. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.33%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18777.43. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6715.19. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.13%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 36.04%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 63.83%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 18518.64. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 40269.69. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.25%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.14%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 71.61%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 22131. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 5.66%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 303. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 23.3. In this region protected areas are not present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 0.91%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 25.45%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 73.64%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.13%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 20.10%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.76%.   Relies on wind energy to produce electricity via 76 turbines. There have been issues/ concerns over the peatland located close to/within the turbine area - local conservation groups campaigned against the turbines because of their potential to ruin the peatland, however, the construction company have also developed the largest peatland restoration scheme in Southern Britain to counter these impacts. Impacts on the 'scenery' for local residents and it may change local territorial identity. The project has brought over 1000 jobs to the areas and is capable of producing sizeable amounts of renewable electritciy.   Natural assets are the land use and wind to ensure that the turbines can successfully generate electricity. They also impact on the scenery for some local communities who overlook the turbines. Social assest - especially given the controversy of this project maintaining good community relations is important. This has been implemented in the project through the community fund, local jobs and peatland restoration fund. May also impact/ change the cultural heritage of the land (i.e., now locals have a different connection to it through the turbines).    Reliance on wind energy which may be unpredictable. Poor relations with local communities/ conservation groups may have been developed (however the construction company have made attempts to improve these relations). Impacts of climate change may impact on the importance of peat protection/ restoration. Also turbines may be relied upon to generate greater amounrs of electricity in the future. Potential impacts on birds (i.e., who may get caught in the turbines arms). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. traditional as windturbines (onshore) are not a new venture. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Onshore and upland wind farms were the 'first generation' of wind farms in UK (i.e., before offshore wind farms). They are present through the UK including within Aberdeenshire LAU1, County Durham LAU1 and Eden LAU1."
