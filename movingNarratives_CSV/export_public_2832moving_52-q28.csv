It is part of an exceptionally well designed high value added local products' claster, run by a monastery, mixing thousand year tradition with modern design and marketing tools, selling history and culture (it is an UNESCO World Heritage site) as much as products. These particular products are innovative and special. Chocolate and biscuits are reasonably new products for the monastery, especially using traditionally produced herbs (levander, thyme, etc.) to make the products special. Packaging and the presentation of the products is also really high quality and innovative. The marketing of the whole products' cluster is based on 'selling the 1000 year history' of the place, all products are made to appear a mixture of tradition and innovation. The UNESCO World heritage status of the monastery is also used effectively in marketing.   The monastery has some 60 ha of land, including a herb garden. They have a well documented history of their own agricultural production (products, stories, etc.) for a 1000 years, this knowledge is used in production and marketing effectively. The managers of the different sections, products (the herb garden, winery, brewery, fruit and vegetable gardens, local shop, design, marketing, etc.) are normally having some strong ties to the monastery (e.g. monks, or graduated from the secondary school of the monastery, etc.) Staff is normally very committed, loyal and strongly identifies with the place and the community. Being a UNESCO World heritage site also helps.    Providing income for the religious and educative activities of the monastery, based on very limited land (the monastery used to have thousands of hectares of land compared to some 50-60 ha today). Harmonising tradition and innovation, finding new ways of marketing, products, design, etc. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted.
