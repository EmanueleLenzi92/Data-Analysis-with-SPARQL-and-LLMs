Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 RO. The processing unit is in the commune of Sura Mica close to the regional city of Sibiu. Wool is purchased from sheep farmers in the surrounding area, including those grazing communal flocks in the nearby mountain pastures of the South Romanian Carpathians. The processing equipment (converting wool to pellets) is purchased from Germany and when fully operational will have a capacity of up to 50 tonnes of pellets per month. The fertilizer is targeted at a range of potential end-users from gardeners to commercial vegetable growers. The pellets are therefore sold in packs of 450g, 1 kg, 5 kg, 15 kg, 25 kg or a Big Bag of 500 kg.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Sura Mica commune in Sibiu County (RO126). Sura Mica commune is located near the city of Sibiu, but wool is collected from the whole of Sibiu county (RO126). Sibiu County is covered by almost equal proportions of forest (35%) and open, semi-natural grasslands (34%) - plus some 20% of relatively low input arable The area supports a remarkable species richness (including many endemic species and medicinal plants), consequently most of the grasslands are considered as High Nature Value (HNV). For a fuller description of the landscape and associated farming systems see here: http://www.efncp.org/download/Sibiu HNVFreport Final.pdf.   The size of the area (km2) is 49.45.

The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 10000. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 21007.63. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.40%.

The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 51620. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 48.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 45.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 42.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 48.00%.   Very innovative use of a low value by-product (wool) from sheep production in the South Romanian Carpathians. This new product could help to maintain the productivity of traditional shepherding systems in the region, especially those in the more marginal mountain areas which are most prone to abandonment. Great example of entrepreneurship and innovation in a very traditional agricultural sector for Romania.   Sibiu is historically an important centre for transhumance in south-east Europe and the area developed a specific farming system based on mixed sheep and cattle grazing and mowing, plus mobile pastoralism on long or short distances. The political changes in late 19th century forced the shepherds to restrain long-distance movements within the boundaries of the Carpathians. This led to early deforestation of the region and the creation of mountain grasslands with their own biodiversity value - what is now commonly known as High Nature Value (HNV) grasslands. The conservation of the biodiversity value of these HNV grassalnds is dependant upon the maintenance of traditional patterns of sheep grazing and hay-making.    The main challenge is developing the brand ('Naked Sheep') and establishing a functional value chain for this new product, especially since it is so unusual and different. However the business has received a lot of attention in the local and national media which is very encouraging for them - see here: https://www.nakedsheep.ro/aparitii-in-mass-media/ The Covid crisis has inevitably slowed the initial growth of the business with a limit on current production capacity because the necessary installaton engineers were not able to travel to Romania. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. 'Naked Sheep' is a start-up company (opened in February 2020) that is buying wool from local sheep farmers and making the wool into pellets that are sold as an organic fertilizer. This is sold online mainly for vegetable growers - the website is here: https://www.nakedsheep.ro/. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural."
