Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 AT. About 94 sheep farmers are associated within the cooperative ARGE Glocknerlamm which was founded in 2003. This cooperative processes and sells the lamb products to private constumers retailers and the regional gastronomy. The Glocknerlamm-Fest tightly connected with tourism is a central event for the marketing of the lamb products. The extensive grazing of the sheep contributes to the stability of the vegetation cover as well as to the improvement of the water storage capacity.

The Mölltal is an inner alpine dry area with a hygric continental climate due to its location in the lee of the Northern and Southern Limestone Alps.

Sheep farming in this region has been a tradition for centuries. Due to the topography and high altimetry cattle farming was not an option. Since 2006 this VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). Glöckner Lamm is protected as word mark designation since 2005. The sheep plays a crucial role for the mountain farming in this region. Additionally, the maintainance of pasture farming is also important for the maintainance of the cultural landscapes which is important for hiking tourism. To secure the income the Genussregion and the marketing as a local speciality plays an important role for this VC.   Sheep farming has a tradition for centuries in this region. The cultural landscapes is important for the marketing strategy also the cultivated traditional sheep races. The lamb is the key product of the region.    The region is situated within the highest mountains of Austria and the topography of the mountains doesn t allow for various farming practices. Sheep farming therefore is one of the few income possibilities for the mountain farmers. Climate change affects this region in regard to biodiversity loss and neophytes as well as a changing water balance. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The knowledge regarding the husbandry is considered to be traditional - also the cultivated races. The marketing as local speciality can be characterized as innovative. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Mountain sheep farming has also been traditional in 13 other regions in Austria (see VC AT 14 and 15) that are considered to have traditional sheep farming not all of them are mountainous regions."
