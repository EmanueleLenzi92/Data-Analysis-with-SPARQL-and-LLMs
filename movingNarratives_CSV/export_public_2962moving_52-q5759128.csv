Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 UK. Highland Spring and Tesco perthsire mineral waters (still and sparkling) depend on extracting spring/ground water from the protected catchment sources in the Ochil Hills and bottling them at their plants for distribution to supermarkets and restaurants and vending machines. These catchment sources do not allow farming (but are grazed by wild deer, rabbits; habitat for bees and birds). There Ochils site (at Blackford, Perthsire) employs around 280 staff. Highland Spring is a listed company (Highland Spring Group) that has sales revenues of £110m (2018 figures) from all brands/sites. The products are transported from their sites by lorry but they are planning a new rail siding to their main bottling plant. We suspect HSG also produce the other brands (Tesco Perthshire, Aldi Strathrowan) but this is unverified. As noted above, HSG are accredited by Soil Association; Good Shopping Guide and Brand Reputation Through Compliance Global Standards; meet ISO14001 standard and approved supplier to Sustainable Restaurant Association. Mineral water will be involved in the wider food and drink tourism or overall Visit Scotland brand that focusses on the healthy and green landscapes for visitors.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Eastern Scotland (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Perth and Kinross. Most of Perth and Kinross is an sparsely populated upland landscape of mountains, lochs and forests, including major rivers (Tay, Earn). The south contains high quality agricultural land and major road and rail links, and the largest settlement of Perth. Like many other parts of the Highlands, this region is popular for tourism and outdoor recreation: it is a relatively accessible area for residents of Scotland's central belt.   The size of the area (km2) is 5383.724292. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1084. The total population (in thousand) is 151.95. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 28.22. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.25%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 149.76. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 6.86%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 24365.68. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 7894.11. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 3.06%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.77%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.17%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 23107.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 65311.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.23%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 18.06%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 80.72%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 21499. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 26.29%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3635. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 35.2. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.46%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.96%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 78.57%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 1.65%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.49%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 83.86%.   The 2nd most used brand in UK (2019) Highland Spring has bottled water at their plant since 1979, bottles 400 million litres p.a, from a Spring found in 1509. They export to 30 countries. They ban farming on the source ground which is grass/heather; the land is organic accredited; and they have EMAS award for sustainability in production/logistics. There are mineral water brands that are produced in other mountain areas across the UK (for example Highland Spring also bottle Hydr8 from Blaen Twyni Breacon Beacon National Park), and most focus on the purity associated with being located in mountains. As stated above, the Highland Group has evolved its production by moving plastic and glass bottling production onsite to reduce travel miles; and contributes to wider UK/industry initiatives on recycling bottles/plastics. Water ratio 1:3 described as industry leading. There has been an increase in the production/marketing of Scottish mineral water over the past decade but these cover wider than the Perthshire LAU1 areas so not sure where to put this wider point. For example, there is now a company that sells Scottish Spring Water for Whisky connecting two value chains (but the sources are not in Perthshire).   This suggests that the VC is based on local assets - so Perthshire Mineral Water is dependent on the groundwater filtered through upland land cover (heather and grass); value is added by the processing done in the glens (valleys) of the EMA (just outside the Highland and Island region) using expertise built over time (plant there since 1979) and Highland Spring describe themselves as major local employers (but not sure if this is really 'traditional' knowledge). HS also contributes to the local assets e.g. supporting local healthy hydration and anti-littering schemes e.g. helping with social assets, reducing negative impacts on natural assets. HS also support national Corporate Social Responsibility activities (charitable and industry associations).    Water Stewardship is increasingly important -reducing pressure on fossil water use and carbon neutrality in processing; and also plastic packaging/transport emissions. Climate change projections suggest less rainfall in the East of Scotland, which (over time) may reduce the amount of groundwater it is safe to abstract. HS Group recently closed its Speyside Glenlivet bottling plant to retrench to their Perthsire plant 'due to the increasingly competitive market' for glassed natural source water products. There have been pay cuts and redundancies due to the drop in demand due to Covid 19 in 2020. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Bottles are now 100% recycled and recyclable for Highland Spring, work with WRAP (UK government Plastic Pact) and SEDEX (NGO for ethical supply chains); and produce bottles onsite to reduce travel miles; and using Air Recovery system to reduce energy use. Won 'most ethical' natural source water brand for 11 years in the row. They market their brand on the basis of local/family connection to the hills whilst being connected to wider global industry debates. There is less information for Tesco brand per se, although Tesco also has general 'Little Helps' Sustainability Plan that includes a focus on water stewardship. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and Cultural.   There are other brands e.g. https://www.purely-scottish.co.uk/ based in Lammermuir Hills in Scottish Borders; https://deesidewater.co.uk/ (Aberdeenshire); https://www.agbarr.co.uk/our-brands/strathmore/ (Angus/Perthshire); Asda Glenburn Scottish Water (from Campsie Fells, Helensburgh and Lomond); Sainsbury Caledonian Scottish water (Campsie Fells); Morrison s still Scottish Water has been discontinued (unclear where it was produced); Aldi Strathrowan is also not specified Strathrowan water travels down through layers of volcanic rock. It is then gently drawn to the surface and bottled in the spectacular Scottish hills . There is also a range of specific spring waters for whisky- https://uisgesource.com/ ; https://uisgesource.com/?page id=5008 (from Ben Nevis/Lochaber, Ross and comarty, Cairngorms Strathspey and Islay - argyll and Bute and islands). Also mineral water from Neath Port Talbot (Wales); and England Buxton spring* (derbshire Dales) and Harrogate Springs* (harrogate) (*not sure if these are EMAs or not)."
