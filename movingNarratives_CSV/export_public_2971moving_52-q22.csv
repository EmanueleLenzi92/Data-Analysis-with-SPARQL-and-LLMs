Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 UK. Welsh Lamb is designated with a PGI mark (since 2003), and it is often considered as the best lamb in the worls. It is reared uing traditional non-intensive processes on (upland) land which is not viable to be used for crop growing or similar activities. Within the Powys area lamb farmers, butchers, abbatoir workers and local shops are involved in the VC. Also local auction houses are involved. The lamb is sold in butchers, supermarkets and in meat boxes online. Welsh lamb, beef and pork industry combined has a value of over £1 billion a year to the Welsh economy and it consumes only 5% of the red meat it produces so exports are very important. Lamb and beef exports account for one third of all sales and are worth more than £224 million (2013). The industry supports over 50,000 jobs. International sales of PGI marked Welsh lamb grew to £154.7 million in 2013.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is East Wales (NUTS 2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Powys. Powys is a large and mostly rural region of Wales, which contains parts of the River Severn, Wye and Usk valleys and the Brecon Beacons in the south, a very popular hiking area. The area contains no large urban areas, although the area is relatively accessible to major population centres in other parts of Wales and England.   The size of the area (km2) is 5195.320923.

Welsh Lamb has PGI status and is world-renowned for being of high quality. The PGI status assures purchasers where the lamb has come from and the specific processes which have been used to rear it. Abbatoirs processing welsh lamb must too use specific processes. Lambs are tagged at birth and so can be associated with a specific farm. Uses marginal mountainous land for production of high-quality food. 80% of Welsh land mass is suited to livestock farming. In Powys as with the rest of Wales they use traditional non-intensive processes to rear their lamb.   Natural assets - Relies on the land to be maintained in same way (i.e., not used for another non-farming purpose) to ensure quality welsh lamb can be reared here. Social assets - good relatoinships within and across the VC. Cultural - relies of traditional knowledge to maintain same lamb rearing processes.    Threats of costs of lamb production/ price obtained at market through Brexit/ COVID lockdown. Welsh lamb very dependent on land so challenges are predicted if land use/ rainfall etc change because of climate change. Local abbatoir has closed in early 2021, impacting on the VC as now some lamb farmers have to travel further. There has been a 99% decrease in local abbatoirs between 1930 and 2017 according to the Sustainable Food Trust. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Traditional value chain as have been using these processes and farming lamb in this area for many years. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Welsh lamb is produced across Wales. Lamb and mutton is also reared in lowland areas of Scotland (i.e. Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders) but also some in the Highlands and Islands regions and in Northern England (e.g. Eden and County Durham)."
