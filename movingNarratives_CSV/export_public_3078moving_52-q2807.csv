Succesfull place-based cooperative of women connected to the territory and engaged with local producers' networks; Use of organic and proximity ingredients and quality certification through 'Participatory Guarantee System'. The brewery is a cooperative with equal participation, involvement and salary for each of the five women that own it. Appart from the hops project, they participate in Madrid Km 0, a coworking space to rethink and manage the stock, transport and delivery of agroecological products coming from the rural areas of the region to the city of Madrid. Around this project, different initiatives generate sinergies to access to markets and consumers from the city.   1) Access to the markets to reach also consumers from other municipalities and from the capital city; 2) Knitting networks of producers in times where rural areas have suffered a great depopulation and land abandonment. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Bailandera beer uses ingredients of proximity and organic and has a quality certification through a participatory guarantee system. Their compromise with the sustainability also reaches the machinery of the brewery, using recycled materials coming from other agroindustries and adapted to the brewery. In addition, their activity goes beyond the beer making as they are engaged in a project to retrieve and enhance the production of autochtonous varieties of hops. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Social.   Although their brewery is located in Bustarviejo, they participate in a project called 'Organic Hops from Madrid Region' that aims to enhance the production of local varieties of hops, and this way they create impact in other municipalities of the region. The hops grow naturally and wild in the riber basin of mamy rivers of the region (indeed it is known with 13 different names across the region). Therefore, its production close to the brewery helps to reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of beer making while allowing the livelihood improvment and diversification."
