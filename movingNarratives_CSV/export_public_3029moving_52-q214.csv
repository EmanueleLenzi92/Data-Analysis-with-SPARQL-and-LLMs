Slovakia produces lamb meat mainly for export to other countries, especially to Italy. The up-to-date offer and Slovak consumer demand for sheepmeat were relatively low. The economic crisis in 2008 and the recent restrictions of exports and imports due to the Covid-19 crisis caused the Slovak producers of lamb meat to be successful in the domestic markets. New marketing strategy intends to sell sheep meat in domestic market. It also requires an increase in consumers demand.   Grassland or feed for sheep, sheep, and domestic (Slovak) consumers demanding lamb meat.    1) low demand for lamb meat by domestic consumers 2) production issue - Shepherds need to protect sheep against the wolves. Wolves are currently protected by law, but the shepherds cannot always protect the herds against them. Ideally, the shepherds would like to increase production to let sheep on the pasture land also overnights and during winter. However, they don't do it because of danger. This situation creates some tensions between the shepherds and nature protection authorities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Sheep breeding in Slovakia is traditional. Innovation is in the marketing and product distribution to the 'new' domestic market. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and social.   Sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia. It is practically present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
