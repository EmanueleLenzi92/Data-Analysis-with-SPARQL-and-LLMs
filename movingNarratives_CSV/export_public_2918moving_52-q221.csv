Because of the geographical location and the relief of Macedonia, the climate in the country is partly Mediterranean and Continental, and on the mountains with peaks over 2000 meters the climate is Mountainous and it offers a very good condition for the honey and the fruits. Production of bee genetic material from Macedonian bee (Apis mellifera macedonica). High quality products, which are produced in a very cleaned environment, such as Maleshevija. Fruits dried and roasted, , especially with added honey, nuts and dried fruits spiced with vanilla and cinnamon are delicious. This way is substituting the desert. When honey is used with the fruits . Beyond the traditional usage of honey, nowadays it is used in different final products, in the catering industry.   Global climate change, environmental pollution, the decrease in natural lands under human pressure weaken the bees and make them more vulnerable to diseases.
