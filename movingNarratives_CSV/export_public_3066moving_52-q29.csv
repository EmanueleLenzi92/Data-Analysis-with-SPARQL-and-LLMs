Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 37 ES. In the pre-Hispanic period, gofio was made manually. With the modernization of technology, the process moved from hydraulic mills to diesel-powered mills to finally produce gofio with electric mills. The production process includes four phases: Cultivation and harvesting of the cereal; Threshing, cleaning, and selection of the grain; Toasting; Milling. Mills are kept in operation in almost all the islands, being more frequent in Gran Canaria and Tenerife, with different types of gofio on the market (oats, wheat, millet, spelt..). It is sold directly in the mills, in local commerce, large-scale distribution, and online.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Gran Canaria Island. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Telde. As mentioned above, the raw material comes mainly from outside the islands. The economic weight and sociocultural value associated with gofio's production and consumption are the two essential elements that define its importance in the Canary Islands as a whole.   The size of the area (km2) is 102.43. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1546. The total population (in thousand) is 102.791.

The gofio of the Canary Islands is a product elaborated mainly from millet or wheat. Its origin is Berber, and the aborigines of the Canary Islands mostly consumed it. In ancient times, different types of gofio were made using ingredients such as wheat, lentils, barley, and even fern rhizomes. After the Canary Islands' conquest, the variety of cereals grew, since until then, only wheat and barley were used. After the discovery of America, it also began to be made with corn or millet. Some mills have outstanding heritage resources related to the history of gofio production. Others, such as the Molino del Fuego in Telde, are more than one hundred years old. There is a whole cultural and social tradition around gofio in the gastronomy and food of the Canary Islands that has spread to other South American and African countries.   Paradoxically, almost all the raw material are grown abroad. Thus, many mills use mixtures of cereals grown outside the islands or send the local millet seed to distant countries such as Argentina, from where they then receive the grain. The small area of millet grown in the municipality of Telde is often used as cattle feed. In some cases, such as in the Biosphere Reserve on the island of La Palma, a social initiative carries out the entire process. The Canary Islands Government has declared 'El Molino del Conde,' located in Telde, Gran Canaria, an Asset of Cultural Interest.    Consumption seems to remain stable, and even the catering industry and other processed foods are beginning to introduce gofio flour in their offer, while production by the mills remains stable. However, there have been critical moments coinciding with the rise in cereal prices or the competition derived from cereals for other purposes, such as biofuels. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. New types of gofio have been introduced from cereals such as spelt or multigrain and organic production or particular range for children. An official competition at the archipelago level promotes every year the quality and innovation of the Canary Islands gofio sector. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Social and cultural.   It is among the best known natural products of the Canary Islands, and its centennial influence has crossed the borders of several countries in the world such as Venezuela, Uruguay, Sahara, Cape Verde, Cuba, United States, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic, among others."
