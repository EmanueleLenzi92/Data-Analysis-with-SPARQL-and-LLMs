Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 43 CH2. The VC is made up of 11 manufacturers and ripeners as well as milk producers from the Jura mountain areas. The milk is processed and sold locally, in large Swiss supermarkets and is exported. Its production is seasonal and runs from 15 August to 31 March. The sales period is from September to April. To make this cheese, the specifications of Vacherin Mont- d'Or; protected designation of origin (PDO) must be respected.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura.

The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 108.63. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 371. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1679. The total population (in thousand) is 13.99. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 128.76. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 14.16%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 199.83. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 36180.16. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.99%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 29.59%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.42%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 39207.62. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 120370.80. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.02%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 71.17%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2046. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 1.24%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1134. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 20. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.93%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.86%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.92%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 15.85%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 81.36%.   Successfull registration of a quality scheme and territorial identitiy with a PDO, high quality product; maintenance of a high milk price for the dairy producers in the VC (in the face of competition and the opening up of markets with EU), thus maintaining the pasture and the landscape, maintenance of extensive grazing in wooden pastures. Being products with rare values.   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest.    The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and social.   Vacherin cheese is also produced in France but it does not labelles with the same PDO and does not follow the same recipe."
