A group of winemakers organize events together and cooperate with each other, taking into account the common interests of the mini wine region. They also have a wine route that helps sellig their products. Their common marketing slogan is Nivegy Valley as a familiar wine region that they all use. They organise wine tastings/dinners, which they harmonise with each other.   Not only their production, but also wine tours/wine tastings/dinners during the scenery. Cooperation and collaboration, local open winemakers contribute to the success of wineries. The wineries adapt to both the natural and cultural conditions of the area with viticulture and winemaking.    Climate change (warming, new pests, extreme weather conditions). Civilisation/urbanisation pressure on the Mountain landscape. Social distancing for COVID cancelled events. Difficulties in cooperation, collaboration and communication between the wineries. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Nivegy Valley has a centuries-old tradition of viticulture and winemaking. Most of the winemakers here carry on the family traditions, but there are also some urban people bringing their knowledge from outside. Sales take place in short supply chains, or via the Internet, the design is in most cases special and demanding, most wines are made with modern technology (innovative). Co-opeation is also an innovative feature for wine-makers. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland.
