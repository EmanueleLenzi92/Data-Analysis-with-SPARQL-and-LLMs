Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 BG. National policies, especially the implementation of the EU-funded rural development policy, has great potential to reverse the loss of public goods due to the abandonment of the HNV grasslands in the region. For example, HNV grasslands have been eligible for agri-environmental payments under the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 Bulgarian Rural Development Programmes. However, they continue to decline in area and greater attention needs to be given to a more integrated approach that addresses the profitability and overall socio-economic viability of the traditional pastoral systems in the region.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Chiprovtsi Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes. Chiprovtsi is a small municipality close to the Bulgarian border with Serbia. The altitude is around 500 metres and the region is dominated by small-scale mixed farming (subsistence and semi-subsistence). The main land use is extensively grazed pastures and meadows (many of which are public) with some plots of cultivated arable land and many traditional orchards.   The size of the area (km2) is 286.9. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 3.139. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 10.94. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 39.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.19%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 4600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 524. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 13.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5200. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 3402. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1497. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 18.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 19010. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 27.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 45.50%.   Provision of public goods through the traditional management (low inputs and extensive grazing) of semi-natural grasslands (pastures and meadows) and mixed cropping systems with high biodiversity and landscape value.   There are around 30,700 ha of Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA) in the Western Stara Planina of which the majority (65%) is pastures and meadows (72% are common grasslands) plus 20% mixed land use associated with the small farms and 15% arable land at lower altitude. Agriculture is traditionally low input and extensive. Together with the low population density and mountain relief this means that the majority of farmland is considered as High Nature Value. This ranges from mosaics of low intensive arable plots and orchards at lower altitude to the alpine grasslands at high altitude with semi-natural meadows and pastures at medium altitude. The low intensity grazing and mowing of these grasslands creates habitats for valuable plant and animal species. The biodiversity richness of these agricultural landscapes is recognised with a total of seven Natura 2000 sites (5 SPAs and 2 pSCI) including significant areas of farmland.    Depopulation has been on-going since the 1960s and has impacted greatly upon traditional livestock breeding with fewer people interested in shepherding. This has been a major driving force for the long-term abandonment of grasslands with scrub encroachment leading to a loss of valuable habitats, especially in more inaccessible areas. At the same time this puts increasing pressure upon those grasslands which are most accessible. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural."
