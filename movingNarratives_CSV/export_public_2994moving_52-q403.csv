Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 SER. Livestock husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the area of Pester plateau. Lamb meat (Sjenica lamb) production is at the basis of the VC, having sheep farms solely for meat, where farmers sell them as live animals to the middle man (usually at very low prices). There were about 28.433 sheep at Sjenica municipality in 2018, but this number is declining. Animals are grazed on natural pastures, with lot of specific wild herbs and plants, which leads to high quality of sheep meat. As a part of the production systems, farmers produce Sjenica sheep cheese, which is also protected as a PDO product. Traditional sheep meat products like Sjenica stelja (dried sheep meat / specific as drying the whole animal) is also protected as PDO product. Farms are mostly owned by farmers and registered as agriculture households, and there are a couple of meat processing units (companies) and small dairies. Farm processing is traditional, and there is an increasing trend in small house processing units registration (Serbia adopted regulative for small processing unit registration). They have to fulfil HACCP requirements. Products are sold at national market, with rising interest for their export. Processing companies usually additionally have Halal certification, aiming Muslim markets and customers. Sheep are sold to the middle man, and only a smaller percentage is sold through the meat processors and local slaughterhouses, directly to the butcher shops and retailers (Metro CashandCarry for example) Regional rural development centre exists in the area, providing advisory support and services to farmers This VC is closely interconnected with VC of cattle breeding, beef meat production and processing, together with producing sheep and mixed cheese (sheep and cow milk cheese).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Pester Highlands (plateau). Pester plateau which is spread on the territory of Sjenica municipality, and parts of Tutin and Novi Pazar. It spreads over 2 NUTS3 regions - Zlatibor and Raska districts. This area is highland landscape of meadows and pastures, with karst structure. This area has very harsh climate very cold winters (with temperatures to -42 C) and hot and dry summers. Very small percentage of the land is cultivated, because farmers usually graze animals on natural pastures, using very little or no fertilisation. Population is multicultural with strong connections to neighbouring countries (farmers have land in cross border regions. Percentage of young people is higher than in some other mountainous areas. This area is special protected area, with Ramstar site since 2006. The area is close to major road to Montenegro, but with very bad infrastructure (roads, infrastructure waste-management, etc.). Due to its beauty and uniqueness, and good quality food, this area is interesting for tourism, mostly rural tourism and adventure tourism. Proximity of Uvac lake (nature reservat) is of a great importance for tourstic offer of the area.   The size of the area (km2) is 1059. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 900. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1300. The total population (in thousand) is 25.69. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 24.26. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -2.73%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 72. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.53%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1056.99. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 10.09%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 41.48%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 48.43%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 23107.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 6880.31. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 10.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 36.86%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 52.94%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 78618. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 5225. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 175.91. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 54.60%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 7.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 37.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 55.10%.   Pester plateau is a Special nature reserve area. Family farming is prevailing, sheep are grazed at natural pastures. Sjenica lamb meat, dry meat products and sheep Sjenica cheese have reputation of high quality. Sjenica sheep cheese is also PDO. The area is well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products. Sheep meat has very strong reputation in the country, as well as abroad (region and traditional markets / Muslim countries). There are potentials to protect PDO product at the EU level and have direct export with the label. Adding value to the products by certifying organic production, and/or other certificates that are in line with nature protection are of a great potential. Additionally, connecting the products with sustainable tourism (rural tourism) and other channels for selling these products (e-commerce) creates potential for avoiding low prices and selling animals. Reopening of export to countries asking for halal meat (Middle East, Turkey, etc.) is slowly increasing. Rising interest of young people to be involved in the livestock production creates possibilities for new approaches to traditional farming and product marketing. Sjenica and Tutin areas have higher percentage of young people than other mountainous regions.   Key local assets are multi-cultural area, with strong connections to the neighbouring countries Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Traditional knowledge on livestock farming and production of traditional products (cheese, dry meat) is kept in large multi-generational families. Strong connection to the cultural and national heritage. High level of entrepreneurial spirit reputation of healthy area, food and hospitality. Specific grazing systems (Highland mountains grazing systems - nomadic). Emerging small and middle size farms are registering processing due to new regulation that are set for small farms and processing units.    Farm gate prices of sheep were very low in 2020, due to the lock down in the season of sheep selling. Many farmers sold parts of their herds, and had problems with feeding of animals due to dry season and heavy rains in the summer. Ecosystems are endangered by pollution and climate change. Family farming is endangered, and their sustainability is fragile. Few farmers sell to the known buyers, there are many 'middle men' that come and buy animals at very low prices. Special nature reserve area is endagered too, together with the grazing system for cattle and sheep. Farmers are not well organised, lack of farmers organisations and problems in the summer time with shepherds. Multi-cultural region, with many connections with Montenegro, Bosnia and Albania, farmers have their pastures in the cross-border region. There are attempts to have more organised marketing of animals, and/or to sell products, not live animals.Not many slaughter houses in the area with limited capacities, not so good infrastructure for animal transport. Registration of farms and usage of IPARD funds for development is rather limited, due to capacities and economic viability. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Grazing of livestock on natural pastures is already major production system; therefore the transition to organic production is not requiring large investments, nor change in animal breeding. There are initiatives for organised organic production / entrepreneurial individuals are organising interested farmers to start collective transition to organic farming. Existing natural conditions offer possibilities for developing other high-quality production systems, including agroecological production, etc. Existing GI protection is combined with other standards like Halal in order to reach foreign markets. There are initiatives for starting e-commerce of the products from this area. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and Wetlands. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   VC is present in Montenegro, since there are farmers in both bordering regions that have pastures in both countries. Additionally, the tradition and cultural heritage is strongly connected to the cross-border region (Serbia and Montenegro, as well as Serbia and Albania). The same type of product / Dry sheep meat (Sjenica stelja) is protected in Montenegro as Montenegrin stelja."
