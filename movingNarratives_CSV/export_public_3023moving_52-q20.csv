A VC is based on the cultural heritage of the only indigenous community of Europe. Albeit it has not yet been developed as much as expected, this VC could have a significant role in the livelihoods of Sami people. For the Sami people, the new product is the touristic offer itself. Besides, e-commerce strategies are being developed to reach more public.   Sami culture cannot be separated from the natural environment where they live. Arctic landscapes, fauna and flora are vital aspects of their worldview. Living in contact with nature has leaded to a deep rooted traditional ecological knowledge in the area. The main touristic attraction is thus the Sami cultural heritage and its relation to the land they inhabit. For the development of the VC it is also important to consider the values of the Sami community and the influence of traditional practices such as reindeer herding on this VC. Finally, scholars highlight the importance of cooperation among different Sami companies and non-Sami touristic industries for the VC's development.    1) To develop the industry and increase the revenues without compromising the indigenous theme of the product; 2) To enhance the cooperataion, collaboration, and synergies among Sami promoters and other companies and industries; 3) To preserve the Sapmi territory and their practices in front of growing industries of Northern regions such as mining, energy, and logging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The VC is innovative as it represents a novel bussiness model for the Sami people. However, the assets and means remain traditional. In addition they are embracing online platforms to promote the VC. An example is the Jokkmokk Market that normally takes place in the locality of Jokkmokk but this year due to COVID-19 Pandemic, it may be carried out online. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The VC is present all along Sapmi territory in Norway, Sweden (Jokkmokk SE2510) and Finland."
