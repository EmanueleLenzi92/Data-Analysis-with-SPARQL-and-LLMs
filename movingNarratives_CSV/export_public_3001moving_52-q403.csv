Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 SER. Pirot white cheese in brine produced in Pirot/Old Mountain area can be made of sheep, cow and mixed milk. Sheep and mixed cheeses are with higher reputation amongst customers. Sheep and mixed cheese is made during the milking sheep season (April-October), when sheep are usually living in the mountains (bacija - summer place for sheep, usually also joint herds form several farmers). Sheep and cow milk is of high quality, due to very good quality animal grazing on natural pastures of high quality (big variety of plant species). Cheese is produced out of pasteurised milk, and after curdling milk, and producing fresh cheese, the cheese is pressed and put in brine to mature for 20-30 days. This cheese can be kept in original package in brine for several months. The cheese is sold directly to the customers, to restaurants and to the delicatessen stores, if the farm is registered for cheese production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia - Stara planina (Old mountain) / Rodophy mountains,. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Old Mountain (Stara planina). Stara Planina is located in eastern Serbia, on the border with Bulgaria, and is part of the vast Balkans. As a morphological unit, it is bordered by the valleys of Beli and Trgoviški Timok, and Visočica, and in the east by the state border.This nature park is a treasury of sediments of different ages, from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic, documented faunistically and floristically, which is why the profiles or entire zones that represent the geoheritage of universal value have been singled out. The relief of the area is extremely morpho-hydrologically intersected, and numerous mountain streams enrich the landscape features. The presence of about 1,190 plant species has been determined on Stara Planina, which makes up 34% of the total flora of Serbia. In addition, it is one of the most important centers of tertiary and glacial endemic relict species. Numerous groups of animals that enrich and beautify this mountain are also represented. The research identified 116 species of diurnal butterflies, 18 species of amphibians and reptiles, 203 species of birds and more than 30 species of mammals. Stara Planina is, for example, the main habitat of red buzzard (Buteo rufinus) and field woodpecker (Alauda arvensis) in Serbia, the main habitat of forest snipe (Scolopax rusticola) in eastern Serbia and the habitat of the endemic Balkan subspecies of woodpecker (Eremophila alpestris balcanica). The peculiarity of the area is reflected in the exceptional richness of cultural and historical monuments dating from the pre-Christian period to the 19th century, among which numerous Serbian Orthodox churches stand out for their beauty.

Pirot white cheese in brine is a high quality product usually made of mixed cow and sheep milk. Also, it can be only cow, or only sheep cheese. The production process is the same. The sheep and mixed cheese can be made only in the sheep milking season, while the cow cheese is made during the whole year. These cheeses have high reputation and are sold usually in restaurants, or delicatessen stores. Sheep and cows, during the season, usually are in the mountains, outside, grazing on natural pastures, with variety of plants. The quality of pastures is influencing high quality of the cheeses. The cheese is kept in brine, and can be sold throughout the year. Family agricultural households are often producing this cheese, selling it on the green market to the customers, or to their regular customers (at the farm). Some of them have registered on-farm processing, and are able to sell the product to the restaurants. Some also use it for their own rural tourism capacities. Pirot white cheese in brine is product that is usually produced on-farm, and therefore, it can involve both very small farmer households, with few animals, as well as bigger ones. Sheep milk is becoming less represented in this cheese, due to the reduction of sheep herds in the Old mountain area. Importance of protecting the ecosystems in the Old Mountain and autochthonous breeds of sheep (Pirot and Karakachan sheep) is of a great importance. Tourism is in expansion in this area, especially rural and sustainable tourism, therefore, it is of a great importance to protect and preserve traditional products form the area, as well as to incorporate them into the new strategies for development of the area. Since this is the bordering area with Bulgaria, there is a big interest from both countries in this matter. The area of Old Mountain close to Bulgaria is also multi-national, with majority of Bulgarian and Serbian nationalities.   The Old Mountain has been placed under protection, in order to preserve: exceptional value of flora and fauna, places that express exceptional geological diversity of the area, such as certain landforms, special occurrences of surface and groundwater and rock formations, beauty and diversity of landscapes, cultural values represented by medieval monasteries and other immovable cultural goods, objects of folk architecture, traditional tools, objects, occupations and customs of local population. Local food and food products play very significant role and represent valuable asset of cultural and gastronomy heritage of the area.    Old Mountain and Pirot district are bordering region with Bulgaria, with very high level of depopulation. Many villages in the most beautiful parts of the mountains are becoming abandoned, or with few old inhabitants. Infrastructure to the villages is not good, creating even bigger problems for the remaining population. Sheep and cattle herds are reducing, especially sheep, due to the limited capacities of the farmers to have sheep outside. There is a big problem with finding professional shepherds; even the conditions offered are very favourable. For this reason, there is a lack of sheep milk, which is why more of cow cheese is produced. Reduction of sheep herds, which are autochthonous Pirot and Karakachan sheep, is negative for the area (grazing is reduced), as well as for loosing important genetic material of very good sheep breed (used both for meat and milk, with very high reputation). Demographics of the area is also very negative, many villages are with only few old people still living there, while young people move to Pirot and/or bigger Serbian cities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Pirot white cheese is mostly produced in small processing on-farm units. There is a Dairy school in the city of Pirot, which is one of the few bigger producers of the white cheese in brine and Pirot hard cheese. This school is good tradition keeper, but in the same time, trying to introduce new ways of cheese marketing and promotion. Online marketing and selling in delicatessen stores are new ways of farmers access to customers, and they need improvement in this sense - packaging, labelling, creating promotional campaigns, etc. Different organisations and CSOs from the area are trying to raise the awareness of the market, in the same time supporting farmers to start using some new marketing tools. Restaurants and rural tourism direct connection, and creation of offers 'from the region' are also new ideas how to improve this product's positioning. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Similar VCs are present in different mountain areas in Serbia (produdction of white cheese in brine / sheep, goat, cow or mixed cheeses)."
