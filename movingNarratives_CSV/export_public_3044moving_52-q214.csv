Slovakia has several mineral water springs in the mountains, which are commercialized for drinking water. Currently, there are 14 brands of mineral waters and numerous spring waters in Slovakia. These waters have been existing on the market for several decades. They are considered to have a high reputation for domestic consumers or even in the Czech Republic. Some waters are recently flavored with local herbs with bio quality. New processes include a combination of mountain water and local wild herbs. The makteting strategies focus not so much on new brands, but on the modification of the products - packaging varieties, flavor and CO2 content.   Local water spring, wild herbs - Raspberry, Blackthorn, Red currant, Gooseberry, Rosehip, Elderberry flower, Dandelion, Chamomile.    1) Competitive market - there are numerous different mineral water brands and their numerous modifications on the Slovak food market. The brands of spring and mineral waters in Slovakia have been established over the last decades. Producers currently focus on keeping the consumers by modifying sold waters regarding varieties of packaging, flavor, and CO2 content. 2) weak promotion of Slovak spring and mineral waters 3) The environmental challenge is the material of packaging. Most of the waters are sold in plastic non-recyclable bottles and rarely in larger volumes than 1,5l. This causes a relatively massive amount of plastic waste. 4) Climate change, especially drought and reduced water quality, can cause a reduction of the amount and quality of infiltrated precipitation waters in a hydrogeological structure which are necessary for mineral waters' formation. Moreover, weather extremes as windstorms can destroy the forest cover across large areas. Consequently, it causes changing the groundwater circulation pattern on a local scale. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovative is the mixture of local resources - water and local wild herbs. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Forestry, Natural land and Meadows with wild herbs. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Slovakia is in number and quality of mineral springs among the richest countries in the world. VC is present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
