The Di Nucci dairy is a very old family company (dated 1662) that produce typical local cheese (e.g., Caciocavallo cheese). The production cycle is performed using only local raw materials establishing fair economic collaboration with local breeders (who supply the milk according to high quality and environmental sustainability standards). The marketing strategy also stresses the link between the Di Nucci dairy with Alto Molise's cultural and rural tradition (like the practice of transhumance) and supporting sustainable development initiatives. The company as a clear vocation for internationalization, oriented towards the haute cuisine sector and experiential tourism (e.g., dairy crafts museum). A new marketing strategy emphasises the family and territorial tradition that makes the product 'unique'. At the same time, the Di Nucci promoted collaboration with local actors, both farmers and institutions, playing a relevant (or even pivotal) role in local development strategy.   The territorial context (in its natural and cultural-historical settings) is engaged in the value chain through both dairy craft skills and cow breeding. Here a social value exchange where a form of cooperation prevails between the different actors involved in the Vcs.    The vocation to internationalization can compromise the 'artisanal' dairy tradition, and the increased request for milk may stress the local environment. The development of the tourism dimension also depends on local institutions and collaboration among local actors. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. An artisanal product (Caciocavallo cheese) is transformed into a high quality good, and it is firmly cultural defined. The relations between the milk producers and the cheese factory are not only economical but based on a common value and perspective to favour the economic development and environmental quality of the territory. The Di Nucci family itself promotes this innovation, and it continues with the young owner generation. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The company has a quality certification about its milk supply chain, and it has won several awards for its products and its innovation strategy."
