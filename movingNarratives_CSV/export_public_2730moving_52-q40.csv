Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 AT. The farms use their own or wild fruits and market their products (mainly) individually either through own on farm shops, via internet, the local gastronomy and regional shops.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Weiz (No: 617). The region Almenland (transl.: Styrian alpine pasture region) is one of the biggest connected pasture-regions in Europe (total 125 pastures, 36,6 km2). The pasture are between 1.200 and 1.500 m above sea level. The climate is characterized as humid, having a lot of thunderstorms. The rock formation is diverse, primarily limestone, further: phyllite, slate and greywacke.   The size of the area (km2) is 1098. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 464. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1720. The total population (in thousand) is 90.654. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 82.56. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.68%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21444. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8141. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.77%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.50%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.73%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 4310. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.77%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4555. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 30. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 58.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   Traditional fine brandies and liqueurs are made from wild fruits and old fruit varieties. Typical for the Almenland is the rowanberry brandy, which is made from the mountain ash berries that grow there in the wild. Some distilleries also offer guided tours through the distillery including a tasting. Schnaps is a traditional product in Austria, but this initiative is of particular interest as the farmers develop a variety of unusual types of drinks .   The high quality products fit well with the 'Genussregion Almenland ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria), and enriches the tourist programme by means of offering guided tours and degustations.    Changing weather conditions due to climate change may impact the vegetation - wild plants as well as the cultivation of fruits to be processed for schnaps. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovative products: broad variety of different types of high quality brandies and liquories. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land and orchards. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Many farms in Austria distil their fruits and those from wild nature (particularly in mountainous areas) - many of them produce in line with high quality standards."
