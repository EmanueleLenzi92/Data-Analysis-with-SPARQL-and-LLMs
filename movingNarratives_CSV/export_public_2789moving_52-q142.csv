Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 FR. In Corsica, on-farm cheese making is defended by an association of farmers (of dairy goats and dairy ewes), Casgiu Casanu, which has existed since 1998 and has been locally and nationally active. It defends farmers' interests regarding the evolution of european and national regulations. It provides specific training (hygiene, different processes for transformation of milk) and it has developped an efficient structure for cheeses' transport, in Corsica and in the French Continent. As on-farm cheese making often plays a key role in preserving traditional know-how, it is recognized in a geographical indication (PDO Brocciu) and plays a central role in the on-going labelling project (5 different projets regarding different types of local cheeses: venachese, sartinese, calinzanincu, niolincu, bastelicacciu). Of-farm cheese making is particularly present in mountainous areas where it is one of the remaining (agricultural) activities. It contributes to the villages' vividness. In its traditional form, this type of husbandry contributes to land management near those villages. New forms of husbandry have developed more recently, which are more intensive (use of foreign breeds, indoors husbandry) and less interconnected to the local ecosystem.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. Corsica is an island in the sea. It presents a great diversity of landscapes: plains, hillsides, deap and steep valleys Small ruminant farming has long been a transhumant activity, occupying all the region. For the past decades, farmers have settled, in the plains and hillsides. Some of them keep on using mountain pastures during Summer. They are scattered within the region, with no remarkable specialised sub-region.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   high reputation products, competing access to land use, vulnerability of ecosystems (fire, lost of biodiversity, erosion of heritage), resources linked to pastoral breeding (breeds, feeding species) and their associated know-how are diminushing. On-farm production is an activity that has been growing. It matches with new expectations about food : local, organic, etc. This contributes to re-define pastoral systems. This lead consumers, farmers and others (among which public policies) to reconsider how livestock impacts territories. The requalification of husbandry embarks both products and ecosystems.We consider husbandry as a lever to regulate socioecological systems, rather than a predatory activity.   to (re)assemble resources that have been built and transmitted in the territory (breeds, feeding species.. ) and to be able to address the issues raisen by the agroecological transition. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Which cheese to produce ? How to process milk ? How to produce milk ? Those are questions that can be answered individually or collectively (common-pool resources such as summer pastures and pastoral surfaces, local breeds, etc.). Those choices can be in continuity with local tradition and know-how, or not. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Dairy husbandry and production of Cheese is observable in every other MRLs. On-farm cheese making is not a specificity of Corsica, but its anteriority is remarkable. Its current expressions gives us insight about how tradition and novelty can interact and produce resilience for territories in recession."
