Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 32 IT. The increase interest in the hazel nuts are changing the traditional location of these plants, once a time cultived in mountain and in marginal area, the new implatation are made in flat irrigated land where it is possible have a mechanisation process.

The production of hazel nuts in Campania has its origins in the mists of time. Nowaday these excellent productions are still less know compareted to the hazel nuts of other italian regions. The Campania hazel nut supply chain is very fragment but In the recent years are born some Organiser Producer group(OP) as 'Il Guscio OP of Visciano', in support of the hazelnut supply chain in Campania and for the benefit of the associated.   The key local asset are mainly cultural. The cuisine of Irpinia makes great use of hazelnuts in some typical local first courses, made with fresh handmade pasta and durum wheat flour .    The increase interest in the hazel nuts are changing the traditional location of these plants, once a time cultivated in mountain and in marginal area, the new implantation are made in flat irrigated land where it is possible have a mechanisation process. The mountain productions need to close the supply chain to be more competitive and to give added value to an excellent product. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Usually, in Irpinia the hazel nut are sold without a preliminary process, but in some case some farm ( Noccioro) have close the supply chain and the products obtained are: Toasted Hazelnuts, Hazelnut Grains, Hazelnut Flour, Hazelnut Paste and Spreadable Creams. They are marketed as raw material in the confectionery sector (pastry shops, ice cream shops, biscuit factories, etc.). The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Cultural."
