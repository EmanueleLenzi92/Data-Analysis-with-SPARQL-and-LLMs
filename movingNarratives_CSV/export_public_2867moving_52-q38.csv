Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 24 IT. In the Piacenza province has an average yearly production of 24 million bottles of wine, with an average selling price slightly above 4 €/bottle. The foothill production of Colli Piacentini PDO is able to obtain higher prices, but often barely enough to compensate the greater production costs and the lower yield that are chracteristic of high slope viticulture. There is a strong need in creating added value on wine of the region. The most dynamic situation can be found in Val Nure and Val Trebbia, where all the production is coming from family owned estates, most under organic certified production and used to joint promotional activities. Many wineries in these valleys have already reached high technical quality and outstanding reputation on the national and international markets. In this environment, the elevation toward mountains of the vineyard is a trend that started about 10 years ago with some pioneers, and that is presently taken in consideration by several wineries.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is 0. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is TRAVO. Colli Piacentini is a portion of the Appenninian mountain chain in Northen Italy. The Colli Piacentini ('Hills of Piacenza') is an Italian wine region located at the western end of Emilia-Romagna. In 1967, it was given the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) quality designation. Within its boundaries are several smaller DOCs including Colli Piacentini Gutturnio, Monterosso Val D'Arda DOC, Trebbianino Val Trebbia DOC and Val Nure del Colli Piacentini DOC. The region has a long history of winemaking with fossilized vine roots and grape seeds excavated from the region showing viticulture taking place as early as 2000 BC. In Roman times, Julius Caesar's father-in-law Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, grew grapes in the Piacenza hills. The Colli Piacentini was once considered part of the Piedmont wine region. To the northwest is the Lombardy wine region of Oltrepò Pavese and, like Oltrepò Pavese, the wine industry of the Colli Piacentini has had strong historical ties to the wine markets of Milan. The region produces over 17 different wines ranging from Vin Santo dessert wines to slightly sparkling frizzante wines. While the practice of labeling wines by varietal is more often associated with New World wines, winemakers in the Colli Piacentini are permitted by DOC regulations to label some of their wines by varietal.   The size of the area (km2) is 81.01. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 122. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 835. The total population (in thousand) is 2.149. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 26.53. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.30%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 198.82. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.60%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18429. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8572. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 3.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 24.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 68.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 17010. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 146732. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 31.50%.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 62.38%.   The landscape is representative of many other foothill area of Appenninian chain all along the Italian peninsula. Global warming and depreciation of mountain land are at the basis of an increased interest of viticulturists for higher altitude parcels with respect to the usual vineyard foothill range. In Colli piacentini area the phenomenon is at the very beginning, and not (yet) triggered by famous brands. The process is at its beginning in the region, and it can take profit from the experience of other more advanced mountin regions, as well as be a model for other areas that want to follow the same track.   The area is at about 1 hour driving from the Milan area, one of the most populated and whealty regions in Europe. It is also very well reputed for its gastronomy, especially bases on cured meat and home made pasta. Wine producers are already associated in joined promotional initiatives.    Depopulation, increase in farmer ages, climate change, and higher pruduction costs compared to lowland agriculture are among the causes of a deep crisis of farming activity in the Italian foothill areas. While grape production is already an underpaid activity, wine production creates enough added value to allow reasonable income and sustainable agriculture activity. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Tradiotional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. In order to characterize its wine production, the region is working on different axis: - put in value the local grape varieties like Malvasia, Ortrugo, and discover other traditional ancient varieties that return to be interesting for climate change resilience - introduce controlled cover crop in vineyard, finding a balance between the practical advantages of the grass between rows, and the water carency in certain areas and periods - embrace the organic standard of production. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
