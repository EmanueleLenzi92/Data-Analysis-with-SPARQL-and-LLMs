Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 CZ. The vision to produce spirits comparable with the best fruits spirits/brandies from France, Spain, Scotlad or Ireland pushes the founders of this VC ahead. To achive their vission they ustilise the elements of the past (e.g. 400 old mill to mature the spirit in its cellars) and local fruits (incl, typyical fruit form the Jeseniky mountain tree - rowanberry). They refer to the past of this mountanin region (e.g. to its former German population) to generate novelty (that is we call it retro-innovation).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jeseniky mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Šumperk. Mountain Reference Landscape (LAU 1 - Vsetín) is the area with high share of highlands and forests.

Regional label, attempt to re-introduce the fruit sipirt production typical for the past in the foothills of Jeseniky mountains. The company is presented as visionaires-producers who want to promote their production of highly qualitative refined products (to produce legendary spirits comaprable with French, Spain, Scotish counterparts). Fruit (plumbs, apples or rowanberry) spirits were traditional spirits made in the area of Jeseniky mountain (rowanberry is the tree typical in the mountains). Destillery Ullersdorf (uses old German name - the Germans lived in the are till the end of WW II) re-started the tradition of formerly exsiting small distelleries in the region of the Desna river valley (foothills of Jeseniky mountains). The VC brings new products (spirit of rowanberry) to contest other extra quality fruit spirits (made of plubms or appricots). Since appricots are not produced in the locality, the company does not produce appricot spirit (some other high quality mountain distilleries do such apricot spirits production). As for the marketing, they refer to the past also in the name (German name /Ullesdorf/ which tnow the village is called inn Czech Velké Losiny). That is also the reason we call it retro-innovation.   Rowanberries as the tree typical for lower levels of Jeseniky mountains (a mountain of similar type). The fruits from the foothills of Jeseniky mountiain (plumbs, apples, pears) and unique space for maturing the spirits (balanced temperature in the cellars of 400 years old grain mill - the work of the mill ceased in the 1980s) are the main assets adding value to VC.    Re-start of type for VC existing in the past. The VC uses also typical fruit from Jeseniky mountain - rowanberry. In the past (the 1990s) the distillery operared only for local people (valley of the river Desna in Jeseniky mountains) who brought their fruits to be destilled for themselves and paid for the distilling process. Now they developed own business distilling their own spirits for sale. They want to utilise local wild fruits form mountains (rowanberry) and fruits from orchards in the local valley of the Desna river. They chllanege contemporary high quality distilleries using regional names but utilising the best fruits form various localities everywhere. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation reflects the problem of large fruit distilleries. They produce high quality spirit using best fruits comming from everywhere (the quality of the fruits is the most important for these distilleries to produce high quality spirits, brandies). This VC utilisies local fruits (and very specific Jeseniky mountain fruit - rowanberry) to built the extra quality of spirit not on the best quality of fruits but on the locality and tis fruits quality and its traditions of siprits production (a sort of retro-innovation). The want to promote new quality of apple spirits. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are orchards and fruit trees. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The company offres also the cattering for festive events using the producst of local farms."
