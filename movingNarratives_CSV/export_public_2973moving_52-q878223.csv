Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 UK. Highland cattle are very symbolic of Scotland and a great cultural asset to Scotland. They are kept as both a cultural asset and due to their good genetics (i.e., they produce leaner meat and birth more calves than other breeds of cows). Their milk also has a high butterfat content so they are frequently kept as house cows.Highland cow are also used to help crop the grass to the right conditions to encourage wildflowers and butterflies. They are well suited to the cold Scottish climate as they are hardy and can survive also in mountainous terrain. In multiple Locahber villages highland cattle roam freely highlighting both their importance to those areas, but also the potential for conflicts.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Lochaber. Lochaber is a region in the west of Scotland which features spectacular scenery, including the highest mountain in the UK, Ben Nevis, coastal areas and valleys. The area is a major destination for tourism and outdoor recreation. The largest town, Fort William, has a population of 10,340, which is slightly over half of the population of the LAU1 mountain reference landscape: the population density is very low in rural parts of the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 4654.827692. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -1. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1346. The total population (in thousand) is 19.805. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 4.25. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.50%.

The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 161. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.25%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.67%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 77.08%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Highland cows are synonymous with Scotland (and mountainous and rural land) due to their long hair and friendly nature. They are hardy and able to survive (and even improve the quality of the) mountainous terrain of the Highlands and Islands region. In Lochaber they are often able to roam free in the common grazings of the villages. They are helpful at encouraging wildflowers and butterflies to areas. They are kept partly for meat, but also more and more commonly as a tourist attraction and a symbol of territorial (i.e. Highland) identity. Highland Cattle as a cultural icon is an innovative new 'product' to be produced from Highland Cattle. They offer an additional attraction to Scottish Highland and Island areas and often are located next to Whisky distilleries or forest parks etc, to offer an additional local attraction. They are also now widely used in marketing processes (i.e. through Visit Scotland, Highland Cow Safaris etc.) as a way to attract new visitors to Scotland.   They can happily live on the poor mountainous terrain throughout Lochaber LAU1, and they are also able to assist with conservation of the area (butterflies and wildfloers). They also add to the scenery of the area due to their attractvie and iconic status. They are an important cultural asset as they help create a cultural link between Scotland and its land. They have also been breed and kept in Scotland for centuries, relying on local and traditional knowledge. In terms of social assets, having highland cows in an area necessitates good relations with the land/ highland cattle owner and the local community and tourism ventures to ensure that the draw of tourists to an area to see the highland cattle is a positive experience for all involved.    Challenges in terms of tourists getting too close to the cattle to get a 'good selfie'. Challenges if their meat/ genetics become less favourable because of restricted market. They may become more difficult/ less important to keep if Scotland becomes less attractive to tourists, or more impacted by climate changes (i.e., then the climate may no longer suit the cattle). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The keeping of highland cows for meat/ genetics is traditional, but their role as a territorial/ cultural identity symbol is new and innovative. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Highland cattle are found across the RR9 and also in lowland areas, with the main stockists close to cities (Aberdeenshire, Central belt near Edinburgh). Breeders are found all over the world including in South America, USA, Australia and the rest of Europe."
