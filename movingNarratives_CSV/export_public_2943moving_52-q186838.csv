Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 RO. In 2019 there were a total of 126,122 bee families / hives registered in Vâlcea County - around three times the amount registered in 1990 (INSSE data, 2021). The owners of these hives range from private households to commercial honey producers selling via many different value chains.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Oraş Brezoi in Vâlcea County (RO415). The relief of Vâlcea County (RO415) is around one-third mountain area in the north of the county with a mixed land cover of forest and semi-natural grasslands. Two mountain groups dominate the region - the Făgăraș Mountains in the east with heights over 2,200 m and the Lotru Mountains in the west with heights over 2,000 m. These are separated by the Olt River valley (one of the most accessible routes through the Southern Carpathians), along which there are smaller groups of mountains - the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains. The central region of the county is sub-mountainous hilly area with a diverse mosaic landscape of fruit orchards, vineyards and semi-natural grasslands - and in the south there is high plain area cultivated with cereals and vegetables.   The size of the area (km2) is 226.8. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 7.118. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 31.38. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 66.9. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.17%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2652.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 38.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 8100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 14241.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 7.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.70%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 11526. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 63.10%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 119190. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 34.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 28.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 36.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 38.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 34.50%.   It is common for bee-keepers in mountain areas to also produce and market Propolis and Pollen products. These are especially appreciated on the Romanian market for their natural therapeutic qualities. There are over 30 such products registered to use the Optional Quality Term (OQT) and label their products with the 'Mountain product' logo. This beekeeper in Brezoi (167794) in the mountain area of Vâlcea County (RO415) produces a very specific product that combines a Poliflora Honey with Propolis and is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/miere-poliflora-cu-propolis-2/).   There are many different types of honey produced in Vâlcea County depending upon the season and the vegetation that is flowering. Polyflora is the most common type derived from multiple sources of flowering plant and is consequently the most common basis for therapeutic bee products.    There is growing concern about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources due to the abandonment of grasslands in the mountain areas and the intensification of arable cropping (including the misuse of pesticides) at lower altitudes. The long-term effects of climate change and climate variability remain unknown but are likely to have negative impacts upon productivity of honeybees. Additional interventions are therefore needed to strengthen the capacity of beekeepers to adapt through integrating climate services with available indigenous knowledge and local practices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
