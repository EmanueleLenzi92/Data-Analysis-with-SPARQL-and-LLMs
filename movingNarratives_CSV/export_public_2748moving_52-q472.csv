The Iskar Gorge in Svoge Municipality (SFO43) in Sofia Province (BG412) is the main pass through the Western Stara Planina mountains and connects Sofia with other major cities in the north-west of Bulgaria. It is renowned for its spectacular landscape and is a popular tourist / day visitor destination.   A deep limestone and sandstone gorge created over thousands of years by the Iskar River. It is 70 km long and renowned for its spectacular scenery consisting of rugged crags and towers / pillars of rock along its entire length. In places the walls of the gorge are up to 300 metres high.    The challenges associated with this value chain are the typical issues with visitor management experienced by popular touristic hotspots in mountain areas. Because of the landscape there are relatively few good viewing points along the gorge and these quickly become congested by parked vehicles. Consequently on a busy summer day (for example), the actual visitor experience can be disappointing. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land.
