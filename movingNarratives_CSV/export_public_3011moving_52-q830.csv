Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 SCA. The cattle grazes in open pastures during the summer time, as the rest of the year they are covered by snow. For this reason, another important element is the cutivation and harvest of winter fodder. It is known that free range also delivers ecosystem services such as seed dissemination or fertilization and fire risk reduction besides the ecological benefits of making use of local and sustainable resources and maintenance of pastures (great carbon sequestration rates in soils). Most of the farms of this kind have small-medium size and many of them combine various animals (cows, goats, sheeps) for meat and dairy production. In addition, in-farm touristic accomodation is getting more and more popular, opening new market opportunities.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Vang. The region is covered by water streams and forests in the low lands, where also pastures and crops are grown, while the higher areas are dominated by heather and alpine medaws for summer pastures. Its geography is very diverese as it changes with the altitude, which leads to multiple land uses and recreational assets during the four seasons.   The size of the area (km2) is 1505.45.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 22.73%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.03%.   Besides having a big cultural component, this VC has an important role in the conservation of mountain pastures. The new product is related to the touristic asset of the VC while the marketing strategies are linked to the cooperation and development of regional brands and e-commerce platforms.   The mountain pastures and climatic conditions of Norwegian mountain areas demand certain type of management techniques and also a great commitment. Practices and konwledge, farm architecture, pasture landscapes and products are part of the cultural heritage of the region. Finally, there is a social component in the cooperation among regional stakeholders fostering the development of the region.    1) Competing meat industry, and access to markets; 2) The need to add value to this VC because of its lower production capacity; 3) Climate change will also affect these ecosystems with increasing temperatures and precipitations as well as shorter winter seasons. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation is about adding value to the VC with touristic packages. In addition, many of the farmers are now involved in regional projects of rural development, thus gaining attention and support through the website of those projects. In addition, e-commerce is an increasing business also for this traditional VC. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.
