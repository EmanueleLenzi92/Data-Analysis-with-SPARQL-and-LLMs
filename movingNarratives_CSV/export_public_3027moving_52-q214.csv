Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SLOVAKIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 SK. Key activities: sheep breeding, cow milk production, cheese production, marketing. Key actors: shepherds, cheese producers, actors in marketing. Labelling: PGI. VC is dependent on mountain sheep breeding which has positive impact on regional SES - maintain traditional land use.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Slovak Carpathians. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zázrivá. The PGI area associated with 'Slovenská bryndza' ocupy more than 80% of the total territory of Slovakia. The above descibed Mountain Reference Landscape Zázrivá (LAU2) is a traditional rural agricultural landscape with scattered settlements throughout the territory resulting from a long-term cultivation by humans. The local landscape is rich in biodiversity and is formed by a mosaic of meadows, pastures, wetlands, and forests.   The size of the area (km2) is 67.25. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 550. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1392. The total population (in thousand) is 2.678. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 39.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.04%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 102.4. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 14100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8724.67. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 49.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 48.97%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 13100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 15737.27. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 2.82%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 48.75%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 48.43%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1168. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.64%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4122. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 103. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 37.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 59.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 37.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 59.00%.   Each type of described cheeses (Slovenská bryndza, Slovenská parenica smoked or not smoked and Slovenský oštiepok - smoked or not smoked) is registered as the protected product of the EU at the national level - Slovakia, having the label 'Protected Geographical Indication' (PGI). They are produced in the same way throughout the whole defined area. The exact breeds of sheep are grazed in the entire designated area, with the same flora and climatic conditions, which results in the same quality of the basic raw material - sheep's milk. All cheese types must contain at least 50% of milk from grazed sheep. These products have a high identity value related to Slovak mountains.   Sheep and cows pasture in mountain areas maintain specific land use and landscape scenery. Sheep pasture in Slovak mountains is traditional and thus has also a cultural value.    1) The pasture presence in mountains has been declining mainly due to socio-demographic and economic changes. The pasture decline also impacts land-use changes towards pasture lands' afforestation and, consequently, causes ecological changes in vegetation composition. 2) In recent years, globalization has affected even the traditional cheese production in Slovakia. Several producers started to import, especially during the winter, the sheep's milk from other European countries located more in the South of Europe. The cheaper imported sheep milk is not originating from grazed sheep but sheep fed in the barn for better milk yield. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Sheep farming is the oldest branch of animal production in Slovakia. It is practically present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
