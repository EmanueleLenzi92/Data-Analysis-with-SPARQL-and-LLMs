Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 BG. Extensive network of collectors working in the mountain ranges closest to Sofia. Commercial collection of wild berries is allowed in National Parks with a special permit issued by the Park Directorate. Wild collection provides an important source of income for local mountain communities, especially in more marginal areas with few other employment opportunities. Storage and processing facilities 50km from Sofia airport for quick and easy distribution by air to international customers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan Mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Stolichna Municipality in Sofia City Province (BG411). Sofia City Province (BG411) is predominantly urban and sits at the base of Vitosha Mountain and to the south of the Western Stara Planina. It contains one municipality (Stolichna) with it's administrative centre being the city of Sofia. Altitude is 500-700 metres. The province is a very important commercial centre and provides a hub for many value chains linked to the surrounding mountains.   The size of the area (km2) is 1348.9.

The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 17100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 19669. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 88.60%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 12900. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 23579. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 16.10%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 82.60%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 12548. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 34.00%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4690. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.80%.

Bulgarian-UK company established since 2003 collecting, processing and exporting 6 types of frozen wild forest berries for chefs and gourmets in Europe and further afield under the 'Mushrooms Bulgaria' brand.   Wild populations of forest berries - notably: blackberries, blueberries, eldeberries, lingonberries, rose hips and strawberries. Wild berries are thought to be qualitatively superior to equivalent cultivated stock and therefore remain in very high demand.    The main challenges with wild collected foods (herbs, berries or mushrooms), especially when working with large networks of (often untrained) collectors, are: a) correctly identifying the relevant species / type; b) avoiding contamination (e.g. with soil or other species); c) maintaining a consistent standard of quality, and; d) sustainable harvesting to ensure the continued viability of the harvested populations. Unsustainable harvesting and overexploitation of the most accessible sites is a major problem in Bulgaria and there have been several initiatives and communication campaigns to address this. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
