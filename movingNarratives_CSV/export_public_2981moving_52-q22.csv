Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 22 UK. As the most southerly 'Munro', Ben Lomond presents an accesible entry point to cultural challenge of 'Munro Bagging' (named after the mountaineer who first surveyed and catalogued Scottish Mountians above 3,000ft/914.4m in 1891). Managed by the National Trust for Scotland, in association with the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority and Forestry Commission, balancing environmental objectives with responsible access is at the core of this value chain, including provision and maintenance of facilities (paths, parking, etc.), and interpretation of the landscape and culture (inc rangers and guides). Engaging local people and groups in activites (e.g. through charities such as the John Muir Trust and the Outdoor Access Trust for Scotland) extends the societal value of Ben Lomond as a destination beyond the tourism economy.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); West Central Scotland (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Helensburgh and Lomond. Helensburgh and Lomond is situated just to the north west of Glasgow and includes the renowned beauty spot of Loch Lomond, as well as surrounding mountains and parts of the northern shore of the Firth of Clyde and Loch Long. Parts of the area are within the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, and it is a highly accessible area for recreation for residents of Glasgow and its northern commuter towns.   The size of the area (km2) is 381.116187. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 9. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 942. The total population (in thousand) is 25.821. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 67.75. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.89%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 0.00. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.00%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 23565.58. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 4014.87. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.17%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 21.34%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 78.49%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 20747.16. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 42723.6. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.10%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2660. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 5.10%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1944. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 43.4. In this region protected areas are not present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.45%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 15.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 82.61%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.27%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.91%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 84.82%.   Scotland is renouned for walking opportunities and 'Munro Bagging' (climbing peaks over 914.4m) ascribes value Scottish mountains as cultural and economic assets. Overlooking iconic Loch Lomond and located close the country's cities, Ben Lomond (974m) is one the most climbed mountains in the country (30,000 climbers in 2010). Mountain climbing is pursued by locals and visitors from a range of societal groups, including serious climbers and recreationalists. It is associated with positive (mental and physical) health benefits. Peaks close to cities and tourism hotspots (such as Ben Lomond) face the greatest opportunities (inc well-being) and challenges (e.g. erosion, wildlife disturbance) associated with access. While mounmtain climbing/hillwalking is a traditional activity, it is increasingly supported by new technologies (equipment, clothing, IT) and underpinning online communities of interest (websites, blogs, social media).   Overlooking iconic Scottish Loch (lake) Lomond, Ben (mountain) Lomond is a natural asset that is valued in ecolocgical (SSSI habitat for black grouse, ptarmigan, upland waders, eagle, pine marten, etc.), societal (accesible from key population centres), cultural (iconic landscape and scenery, most popular 'Munro'), and economic (tourism and hospitality) terms. The average daily spend of the 'long walk' market in Scotland is £19 per day (2015), increasing by approx 4x when accomodation is included (based on 2003 figures). The hill and long distance walking sector in the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park was valued at £3.5m in 2011, after costs.    Balance of environmental protection (including SSSI species) and visitor access objectives, including erosion from footfall and wildlife disturbance (e.g from drones). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Projects based on enhanced mental health and wellbeing and/or re-skilling based on activities such as green exercise and repairing damage associated with visitor access. Online communities (inclduing Munro society, and other hill walking and mountaineering groups) providing information and exhange relating to routes, tips, sharing photography, etc. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Other accessible Munros include Ben Chonzie, Ben Lawers and Schiehallion in Perth and Kinross (LAU1), Mount Keen in Aberdeenshire (LAU1), and Driesh and Mayar in Angus (LAU1). The value chains surrounding each mountain as a walking destination is different, depending on aspects such as land use and ownership along access routes, and distance to towns and cities and other tourism hotspots. Stakeholders include mountaineering clubs, local communities, and online guides and enthusiasts. Mount Snowdon in Gwynedd (LAU1) is the third most visted attraction in Wales, and located in the Snowdonia National Park and faces similar challenges to Ben Lomond in terms of safeguarding the natural environment in the context of access pressures."
