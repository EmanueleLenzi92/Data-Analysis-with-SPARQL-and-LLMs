The vineyards are owned by member producers of the cooperative and their families. The processing (vinification) capacity of the facilities is 700 tons in 12 hours and for the production and preservation of superior quality wines, the company has a 3 storey wine cellar of 1350 sq.m. per floor with stainless steel wine tanks bearing a capacity of 2,400 tons and a bottling plant with a capacity of 5000 bottles per hour. It is the most important economic activity for the regional SES, also affecting the lanscape and ecosystem through a sustainable traditional approach.

The PDO Peza zone was established in 1971 for red wine and in 1982 for white wine, situated in the central-eastern mountain areas of Crete. The vineyards of Peza stretch sinuously on hilly terrain of varying inclines and exposures around the plain of Peza, in Heraklion district, at altitudes of up to 700m. Here, the red varieties of Kotsifali and Mandilaria are cultivated in deep calcareous soil, although the vineyards of Peza are best known for the production of whites from the local Vilana variety. It is mainly cultivated in the plain around the village of Peza but the vvineyards at higher altitudes, where ripening is more slow and gentle, yield more aromatic wines. The area, with its modern, linear plantings, has the fastest pace of growth among Crete s vine growing areas. The vineyards are planted at altitudes higher than 300m and they area a great example of mountain products that have established a high reputation, providing territorial idendity and supporting the community in the long-run. As in much of Crete, wine has likely been made here for thousands of years. Various ancient wine presses and amphorae found across the whole island point to a long tradition of wine industry in the regio from ancient years. Soil quality, agricultural practices and participation of the community are contributing to a brand name that is gaining loyal customers in a widespread area outside the community and also the island of Crete. There are more than 35,000 stremmas of vineyards in the area of the Peza Union, 14,000 of which are producing VQPRD vines, 9,000 for table wines and 12,000 for raisins and table grapes. VQPRD stands for the E.U. characterisation of 'Vin de Qualite Produit de Region Determine' signifying special regions of distinguished quality products. The product of this VC presents great perspectives of growth and market share expansion, while also preserving traditional practices and the use of locally specific resources. This VC is very much engaged with local producers and their families,working as a farmers' co-operative of 10 local villages and continuing a wine-production tradition of centuries. The growing expansion of this industry raises challenges for the sustainability of practices, as well as the potential of the cooperative to cover future demand. Another challenge is the sensitivity of wine production level and quality against climate change. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Peza Union and all their components are strongly interested in the development of new commercial presentations. In fact, the Sector has put in the market diverse kinds of wines and is also aware about the demand of consumer for natural products. Following this line of innovation, the Union has developed products including high proportion or total presence of natural products. The development of this kind of products requires research that is beyond the possibilities of one single company or association. Moreover, the investment of PEZA UNION in the technology of aseptic package Tetra Pak offered the opportunity of producing another innovative product in continuation to the rationale of the standardization of wine in bag-in-box (The Party's Wine). The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Similar VCs based on wine production can be identified in other regions of Crete (MRL - NUTS3 : EL432, EL433, EL434)."
