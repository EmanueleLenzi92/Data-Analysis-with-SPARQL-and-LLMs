Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 CZ. Owners of the forest land, companies harvesting wood, households and companies that purchase wood. The VC is embedded in regional ecosystem. The current crisis (bark beetle) creats new disbalances that are present in forest ecosystem (rapid renewal of large forest land) and regional economy (low price of wood that hardly exceeds the costs of harvesting the wood).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Prachatice. Prevailing area of the region (LAU 1 - Prachatice) consist of submontane highlands (with altitude 600-800 meters). Some settlements are located in the altitude around 800 meters. Climate conditions are affected by relatively high altitude of the region. The region is rich of forestsw, which cover 52 % of the region. Share of agricultural land (due to the high altitude) is above regional average (wthin NUTS 3 level). The region is highly attractive for tourist during WInter and Summer season due to the unique nature. The region includes two nature protected areas.   The size of the area (km2) is 1377. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 410. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1378. The total population (in thousand) is 50.978. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 37. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 69.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9511.27. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9783.27. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.00%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9836.73. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 19458.96. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 43.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 52.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 62533. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.67%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4971. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 150. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.50%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 53.90%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Wood processing is a typical VC that is associated with Sumava mountains. This value impacts significantly on the look of the landscape and ecology of the region. The VC directly stems from the natural resources that are embedded in region.   Sumava Mountains is rich source of wood. The forests located in the national park and the nature protected areas are not the part of this VC. The wood for energy production is harvested outside these areas. Most of the wood that is harvested in this way is indeed used for industry (see the VCI CZ 19). The wood that is not suitable for the industry is used as a fuel. The wood is available for household consumption (for heating houses) and also for companies producing heat and electricity on centralized basis. Wood is considered in the Czech Republic a sustainable source of energy and therefore it plays an important function in the national energy mix.    The wood processing sector is changing rapidly. The forestry in the Sumava mountains faces major environmental challenge represented by the bark beetle that destroys vast areas of forest land (spruce trees). Since 2019 there is a surplass of wood that is being harvested due to the parasite. This situation creates price pressure on local harvesting companies and owners of the forest land, who are required to cut down the spruce trees and renew the forests after the harvest. Main challenge for the future is renew the forest land so that the new forests will be resilient to the parasite and will be able to fulfull multiple functions. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   The VC as such exists in neigboring countries. However, the VC in the Czech Republic is nowadays undergoing a major transition process."
