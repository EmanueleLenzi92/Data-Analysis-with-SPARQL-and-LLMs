Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 UK. Scotch beef is a PGI marked product i.e. it will be awarded PGI status if it is produced in Scotland from cattle reared, slaughtered and dressed in Scotland. Scotch beef industry is worth £675 million and Scotland has more than 30% of the UK beef herd. Although beef is often processed in lowland areas, the cattle are reared in upland areas, including within Skye and Lochalsh (LAU1). Scotch beef is world renowed for its quality and high welfare standards. For example, Isle of Skye Free Range rear Shetland beef on the hills of Skye. Waternish farm rear a herd of Aberdeen Angus and they graze the rough grazing and improve the land through grazing and their dung for improving the pasture's nutrient cycle. Many of these farmers also act as conservators of the land, improving it for wildlife and biodiversity. There is an ongoing project attempting to develop a local micro-abbatoir on Skye to reduce food miles and environmental impact and create local jobs.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Skye and Lochalsh. Skye and Lochalsh features the large island of Skye (joined to the mainland via bridge) and a remote part of the western coast of Scotland. The area is relatively isolated with long journeys required to reach larger cities in Scotland, but includes spectacular mountains and coastal scenery and is therefore popular with tourists and visitors. As with many areas of western Scotland, the area is sparsely populated with some larger settlements near the coast. The region has road, rail and ferry links, but these are prone to weather disruption and the networks pass through upland areas.   The size of the area (km2) is 2742.463983. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -4. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1184. The total population (in thousand) is 13.25. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 4.83. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.84%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21200.32. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2790.74. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.43%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.07%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 72.50%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 29913. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 49.78%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 346. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.25%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.67%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 77.08%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Successful registration of the PGI scheme of scotch beef. Important for territorial identity of the Highlands and Islands region because of the PGI status. Important means of conservation of the area (i.e. through environmental schemes and grazing of the common grazing). The creation of a local abbatoir is also of interest to shorten the supply chains and the imapcts on the environment.   Natural assets: The importance of maintaining the landscape and land use so it suitable for scotch beef, and simultaneously these cattle and improve the natural asset. Social assets - strong relationships throughout the value chain to ensure that the PGI status is maintained and to create the local abbatoir. Also good relations amongst the cattle farmers who often rear cattle on upland common grazing (shared land for farming). Social assets have also been strengthened through the recent scotch beef monitor farm project within Skye and Lochalsh. Cultural assets are the reliance and cotinuation of traditional knowledge and practices for ensuring good quality scotch beef production.    Scotch beef requires full rearing and production in Scotland, which may become more difficult if costs become too high or more competitive elsewhere. Scotch beef is highly reputatble across the world however this may change in the future, especially if there is an outbreak of disease i.e. Bovine TB/ foot and mouth etc. Impacts from climate change may change the land characteristics of the area, meaning that the scotch beef are unable to be reared in areas such as Skye and Lochalsh. Also there is potential for over grazing of areas to meet or increase demand/ profits of scotch beef. Impacts of/ on scotch beef may change with new government policies. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Scotch beef production is a very traditional activity within Scotland's upland regions. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The scotch beef value chain is present across the Highlands and Islands including in Lochaber (LAU1), Aberdeenshire (LAU1), and Perth and Kinross (LAU1). Scotch beef can only be produced in Scotland, however other livestock farming is present across the UK (however this will not have the Scotch beef PGI mark)."
