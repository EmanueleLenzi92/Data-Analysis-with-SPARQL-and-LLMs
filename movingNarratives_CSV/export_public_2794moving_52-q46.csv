Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 FR. Autumn honey is made almost exclusively from arbutus unedo honey. Its strongly bitter taste characteristic distinguishes it very easily from other honeys in the range. Its market value is ambivalent and varies according to the regions of Europe and according to consumption habits. It is very popular in Italy, especially in Sardinia, while it is the least sold of the PDO range in Corsica and France. It is sought after by 'connoisseurs' and rejected by irregular consumers. Its consumption with a spoon is also different. Maintaining and stabilizing value is dependent on both arbutus stands and contrasting consumption habits in Europe.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the mobility of apiaries from littoral to medium and high mountain in the same way.the production of chestnut honey is widespread and requires a stay of 1 to 2 months in mid-mountain areas, often near villages.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   The fame of Corsican honey is old but its contemporary reputation results from the professionalization of the activity since 1980 and subsequently from a recognition consecrated by obtaining a PDO in 1998. The PDO brings together six honeys. Among the 6 honeys, the autumn maquis honey in the range is dependent on arbutus unedo stands. The value of this honey differs from others in the PDO range because it is dependent on both the preservation of arbutus unedo stands and the maintenance (or development) of consumption habits for bitter honey.   the challenge is to continue producing this honey and to promote it in order to preserve both the enhancement and balance of the PDO range and the preservation of arbutus unedo stands subject to fires and particularly vulnerable to increasing drought linked to global warming. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The innovation consists of designing a marketing strategy aimed at associating the promotion of honey with a public of European connoisseurs and the preservation of unedo arbutus stands for which there has been a decrease in the Mediterranean areas due to fires and increasing drought. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   It is present in every MRLs : Austria, Czech republic, Crete, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia."
