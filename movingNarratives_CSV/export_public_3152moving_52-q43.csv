Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 TR. Approximately 4517 tons of grapes were produced in Elmalı in 2020. 45% of the grape production in Elmalı is fresh table grape, 40% wine grape and 15% dried grape. There are two main marketing channels used by grape growers. The grape growers have problems in marketing fresh table grapes. The growers prefer to sell directly to consumers in order to get a high price for fresh table grapes. The growers sell wine grapes to wine companies. The problem in the grape value chain can be seen in the marketing of fresh grapes. One of the negative aspects of the value chain is that the grapes produced are supplied to the market without being processed. Also, it is observed that the grape growers in Elmalı do not have a farmer organization. On the other hand, the fact that the grape grown in the region is a quality and special variety is an important opportunity to improve the value chain.
