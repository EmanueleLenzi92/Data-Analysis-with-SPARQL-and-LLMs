Pin Lariccio grows in high altitudes, mostly in lands that are property of the state and managed by the National Office of Forest (ONF in France). This makes this public organization the main producer of PIn Lariccio, along with other missions such as forst management, preservation of the environment and public reception (summer tourism). A interprofessionnal organization was created in 2010 in order to organize and promote the sector, which is less developed than elsewhere in France; it federates the activities involved in wood extraction and the ones involved in construction.In 2020, the regional office for agricultural and rural development had a brand recognized for Corsican lumber : Lignum Corsica. There is a political will to promote this sector and to push local stakeholders to use local lumber for construction (public buildings and private ones).   To organize and to find conditions for existing durably.To provide for local construction (in a context of political will for reducing dependencies). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Wood products coming from Pin Lariccio are expensive: they are sold 42€/m3 which is 70% higher than comparable tree essences (fir). This activity suffers from exogeneous competition, based on exotic essences. The main stakeholders adapt and propose both local essences and foreign ones. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry, Natural land, Schrubs and summer pastures. The local assets include Natural.   Similar VC was identified in other MRls, in Czech Republic, Hungary, North Macedonia."
