In this VC, farmers adopt the label 'Prodotto di Montagna (mountain product) to emphasise their products' quality (white garlic and herbs). They also stress the quality of the (unpolluted) mountain air and soil, which adds more aromaticity to their products. Specific attention is paid to packaging, following the food market trend, which appreciates packaging that recalls both rural culture and modern style. E-commerce is also implemented. Comparing with the tradition farming in the context, in this case promoters adopt marketing and commercialization strategies in line with market trends (e-commerce and attractive packaging).   In the VC, the natural context is engaged as characterizing by production and products. Mountain unpolluted air and lands are considered ad an add-value to the VC.    The VC is relatively small, and it does not involve local institutions or other farmers. The socio-environmental elements of the SES engaged in the VC are the farmer skills and the natural territorial aspects of the area (mountain characteristics and no polluted context). The VC is not culturally connoted, and there is no clear focus on sustainability or health issues related to the products. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. VC promoters use their skills acquired outside their home context (e.g. during university studies and previous work experiences). These competencies are applied to the cultivation of typical local products using marketing and commercialization strategies in line with market trends (e-commerce and attractive packaging). The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and social."
