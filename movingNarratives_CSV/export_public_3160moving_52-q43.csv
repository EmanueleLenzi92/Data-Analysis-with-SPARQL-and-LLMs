It is produced from different types of flowers on the Anzer Plateau. It is obtained from a 13 km long valley at an altitude of 1750- 3150 meters. The rich flora and fauna of the region also attracts many tourists to the Anzer plateau. Anzer honey has a strong reputation in the region and is famous around the world. It is a high-quality honey.   The vegetation of the Anzer Plateau has a rich plant diversity which includes endemic plants. The production locations are surrounded by high mountain ranges exceeding 3000 meters to the east, west and south. This creates a natural ecosystem which is differentiated from surrounding places in terms of climate, flora and other natural features. These differences are reflected in the nectar and the honey. Anzer honey has Geographical Indication from the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office. An annual İkizdere Anzer Honey and Plateau festival is organized in the first week of August.    The quantity of honey produced is limited and therefore the price is expensive. The amount of Anzer honey production varies according to climatic conditions. Grazing by small ruminants also reduces the yield of anzer honey. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.
