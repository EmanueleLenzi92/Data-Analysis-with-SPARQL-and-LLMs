Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 AT. The hay milk is produced by organic farmers, who supply to the regional diary. The dairy processes it to a very big range of dairy products, which are then exclusively sold under the Label 'Zurück zum Ursprung' throughout Austria in supermarkets. The supermarket chain owns the brand, quality control is done according the EU and Austrian regulations for organic products by public authorities. The brand-specific quality criteria have been set up in cooperation with a consultancy, which also controls the compliance with these criteria, which embrace the following issues: regionality, animal welfare, transparency, environmental protection, food quality, GM free, fairness for farmers, fairness for consumers. Furthermore, the added value for the region is calculated by the independent research institute for organic farming. The calculation model analyzes the possible added value for a region that can result from the production and marketing of food in Austria.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Murau (No: 614). The district of Murau is a peripheral region in the center of Austria north to Carinthia and east to the Lungau (a NUTS3 region in Salzburg, see VC of Lungauer Eachtlinge therefore next to the cold pole of Austria). The region can be considered as (very) peripheral (main roads are far away; the high-level rail link on the edge of the district will be lost in the next few years due to a new route). The river Mur (after which the region is named) flows through the main valley. The district of Murau is enclosed by the Niedere Tauern mountains in the north, the Seetaler Alps in the east and the Gurktaler Alps in the south and west. The lowest place is at an altitude of 650 m above sea level and the highest place 1,763 m above sea level. The highest elevation is at 2,740 m. The district of Murau is one of the most densely wooded areas in Styria, thus wood in general play a major role economically and thematically. The district has the largest closed stand of Swiss stone pines in Central Europe. The district also has an relatively small-scale industrial structure and has been scoring increasingly in the field of tourism for years.   The size of the area (km2) is 1385.4. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 650. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2740. The total population (in thousand) is 27.543. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 19.88. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.15%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21614.5. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2877. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.48%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.86%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 12940. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 8.32%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1613. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 82. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 7.87%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   150 certified organic mountain farms participate in hay milk production. The initiative started in 206 based on conventional farming, and turned then in 2008 to an organic scheme. The products are marketed under the trade mark Zurück zum Ursprung ( back to the origin ) and sold throughout Austria via a supermarket discounter. The production of organic hay milk is based on extensive agricultural practices. The economic viability is dependent on public support and price premia payments. Under the trade mark quality standards are set, extension services, quality assurance and the traceability is managed. That leads to a product differentiation, which creates an added value, and the marketing is exclusively via selling through the large supermarket discounter. The initiative responds to various shortcomings and development in the milk sector, such as the EU milk market with price volatility and an intensification of production, but also to an increasing consumer preference for regional and sustainable products.   The maintenance of mosaic like areas of grassland, meadows, alpine pastures and High Nature Value farmland through cattle grazing, hay mowing and aftermath reduces scrub and tree encroachment as well as the risk of mudflows and landslides, and thereby guarantees high levels of biodiversity. Moreover, the economic viability of organic milk producing farms is increased, which is a big farming sector in the region of Murau (there are more than 440 organic farms in the region - approx. 35% participate in the 'back to the origin' initiative). The added value for the region is calculated by a research institute, for dairy products there is 51-80% added value for the region. The contribution to regional resilience is calculated as well.    Challenges refer to climate change related issues, such as effects on the feedbase for this pasture based milk production as the vegetation might change, and the production of hay for the winter time. Moreover, the specific actor constellation grants much power to the trade mark, resp. the supermarket. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Establishment of a joint quality certification scheme and joint marketing and sales strategy. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland and pasture farming. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   There are other hay milk related VCs in Austria, but this is unique due to its specific labelling scheme."
