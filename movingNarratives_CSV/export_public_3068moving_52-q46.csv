Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 39 ES. The textile craftsmanship had in Grazalema a complete articulation in the different phases of the production process. Successive crises, started in the mid-nineteenth century by the competitiveness of synthetic materials, textile industries located in other Spanish regions, or the absence of competitive transport networks, caused a steady decline in the activity until today with the presence of a small company, Mantas de Grazalema, which keeps alive that legacy. The type of product has expanded, along with the traditional blankets and scarves. The production is sold directly in two stores located in the municipality as well as throughout Europe and countries like the USA or Japan, increasingly thanks to online sales, difficult to sell through retail due to the current pandemic.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic Systems. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Grazalema. Craft textile production in Grazalema has always had a close connection with its environment. This has provided abundant water, necessary to move the machines, generate good pastures for sheep that influenced the quality of the wool, as well as a social and cultural structure appropriate to organize a production chain that articulated the local economy. Today the natural conditions are still optimal, but the productive and social practices have changed a lot, so the handicraft faces a challenge of survival and reinvention.

The company, Mantas de Grazalema, uses selected Merino sheep wool to produce blankets, scarves, and other textile garments, combining traditional and handcrafted manufacturing techniques with mechanized processes.   The primary resource continues to be virgin merino sheep's wool from both within and outside the region. Some phases of the process (washing and spinning) have been outsourced, specializing in the weaving and finishing phase activity.    After a flourishing textile industry for more than three centuries, a single company keeps this legacy alive, having to face the difficulties linked to the higher price of handmade products and the negative impact of the economic crisis of 2008 and the current crisis. The main challenge is to survive in this complex socioeconomic environment, which is not very favourable to craftsmanship. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. There is innovation associated with new products (hats, ties, bags..), customization (yoga and pilates blankets, dogs and cats..), new designs, connection with the cultural and tourist offer of the municipality, and a very successful online sales platform that partly compensates for the drop in sales due to the current crisis. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Sheep wool. The local assets include Social and cultural.   Several European regions keep sheep wool textile production alive, including the Serra da Estrela in Portugal and Ötztal, the most 'sheep-intensive' valley in Austria."
