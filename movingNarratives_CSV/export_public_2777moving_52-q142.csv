Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 FR1. Extensive sheep farming and pastoralism are characteristic of Drôme valley mountain and mid-mountain areas. Local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to the consumer or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron' allows to produce value on the territory. However, this value chain is very dependent on financial support from the EU. The VC suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, changes in consumer demand, impact on biodiversity. There are many local and regional stakeholder organizations (ADEM/PNR/FDO..) requesting support to address these issues through ecological, economic and social impact assessment of VC and support to change practices.

Local valorization, creation of added value, local economic organization on the territory: Local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to the consumer or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron' allows to produce value on the territory. Development of adaptation practices in the face of climate change Sharing of mountain space and production of ecosystem services provided in the mountains (silvopastoralism). New marketing strategies: creation of a local filiere of organic sheep meet through direct sale and labels New governance systems: different actors using the mountain space gathers to define a common strategy of use such as 'Plan Pastoral Territorial'. Depends a lot of public policies, regional and local.   Natural asset: Providing ecosystem services in the mountain: sylvopastoralism, ecopasturing. economic asset: Creation of local added value, local employment, answer to territorial food demand cultural asset: contribution of local food heritage, conservation of traditional jobs and know how.    Extensive sheep farming and pastoralism are characteristic of Drôme valley mountain and mid-mountain areas.However, this value chain is very dependent on financial support from the EU. The VC suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, changes in consumer demand, impact on biodiversity. There are many local and regional stakeholder organizations (ADEM/PNR/FDO..) requesting support to address these issues through ecological, economic and social impact assessment of VC and support to change practices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. - local valorization, creation of added value, local economic organization on the territory: Local slaughtering and direct sales either directly to the consumer or with the label 'Agneau de sisteron' allows to produce value on the territory. - production of innovative ecosystem services provided in the mountains (silvopastoralism). The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and water. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
