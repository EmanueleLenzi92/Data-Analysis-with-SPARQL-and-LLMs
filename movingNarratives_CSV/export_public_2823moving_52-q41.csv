Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 GR. The actors in Ammotopos include: Small animal husbandry farmers where milk production is the main source of income. The company EPIRUS SA that operates in the region is one of the largest cheese-producing companies in Greece. The activities include: quality assurance, collection-transport of milk, quality control, milk processing, the maturing process and packaging. Milk processed and produced in state-of-the-art facilities and packaged in the Epirus region. Epirus Feta is marketed throughout the world. Yet, a decline in milk production has been reported in recent years. This is possibly linked to an ageing population. Moreiover this type of farming has become a subsistence activity and the lack of policies regarding pricing schemes add to the economic sustainability conerns,. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Xerovouni/ PINDOS MOUNBTAIN RANGE. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ammotopos. Epirus is a rugged and mountainous in northwestern Greece. The largest proportion of it's land is considered mountainous, with three main mountains: Tzoumerka (Athmanika), Xerovouni and Ori Valtou, all belonging to the Pindos Mountain Range. The Vikos-Aoos and Pindus National Parks are situated in the Ioannina Prefecture of the region. Both areas have a wide range of fauna and flora. The warm, alpine and dry climate of Xerovouni is important for the production of feta, since it permits the breeding of sheeps and goats. The vegetation in the area is composed mainly of coniferous species. The size of the area (km2) is 920.3. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0.

It is the best-known Greek cheese. It has a territorial identity and traditional cheese production methods are applied. Sheep and goat farming is considered to be one of the most dynamic sectors of the rural economy of Ammotopos, both in terms of employment and overall income. Ammotopos is a mountainous disadvantaged area of Greece. The goat and sheep faming sector has a strong link with the land and the environment, with a recognised role in biodiversity and landscape conservation and in measures to combat forest fires. Epirus Feta is a PDO product. Ammotopos region as a whole is rugged and mountainous. Sheep and goat pastoralism have always been an important activity in the region (Epirus provides more than 45% of milkt to the Greek market) but there seems to be a decline in recent years. Hence, cheese production is a traditional and culturally relevant product. It is exported to many countries and has been granted several awards for taste and quality. The PDO status of the product, the fact that production takes place in the same area, maintains the animal husbandry customes of the culture and sustains the population of the region. Traditional cheese production methods are applied along with innovative changes in production.   Greece ranks seventh in global goat milk production (5, 2%).The Epirus region has the highest milk production and it is known for its animal husbandry, milk and milk products These two sectors of animal production (sheep and goat) are of paramount importance for economic and social reasons, because they help sustain the social fabric of local society in Ammotopos. This is the case since Epirus is the region in Greece with the third lowest GDP per capita and one of the poorest regions in the EU. The Epirus Feta production system is semi-extensive one and is based on the exploitation of local natural resources in Ammotopos. This is a challenge since this mountainous region is characterised by small size farms with an excessive fragmentation and degradation of communal pastures and a high proportion of leased arable and pasture lands. The sustainability of this animal husbandry sector requires the implementation of policies that can improve the infrastructures in the mountain areas and to take support measures for low input farming systems. Ageing population of farmers, unfair competition and the misleading of consumers by imitation products are also challenges. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation relates to production and distributing. Innovation includes the production of low sodium and low fat feta a change to meet today's consumer's needs. New market and packaging strategies and exporting pathways are also being devleloped. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Social and cultural. This PDO cheese is produced only in Epirus. Nevertheless, feta in general is produced all over Greece and in other European countries."
