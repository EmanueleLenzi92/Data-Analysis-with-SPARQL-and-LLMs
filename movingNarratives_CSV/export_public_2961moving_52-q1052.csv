Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 RO. The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' began selling fresh (eviscerated) Rainbow Trout in 2018 and has since diversified into the processing and sale of a broad range of additional products, including smoked Trout, Trout cavier, several different types of Trout pate, marinated Trout and Trout in various forms of sauce. In total the business has registered 15 different products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/?filters=product cat%5b51%5d judet%5b72%5d) as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see below. All sales are direct to consumers via two farm shops in Bușteni, plus an online shop.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Oraş Busteni in Prahova County (RO316). The relief of Prahova County (RO316) is split equally between mountains / hills in the north and and plain in the south. The mountainous zone is characterised by a deep forested valley (the Prahova River Valley) that transects the so-called Carpathian Bend and divides the southern end of the Eastern Carpathians eastern end of the Southern Carpathians. The landscape of the Prahova River Valley is dominated by the steep rocky slopes of the Bucegi mountains which rise to 2,505 metres. The Prahova valley is 1.5 hours north of the capital city of Bucharest and is an important tourist destination with popular ski resorts at Sinaiai and Busteni. There are also important cultural locations such as Peles and Cantacuzino Castles.   The size of the area (km2) is 75.5. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified.

Aquaculture in Romania is dominated by semi-extensive production of common carp in the lowland regions. Farming and processing of trout in the mountains is a more recent development but enjoys a growing market for fresh trout and processed products, as well as integration with various forms of mountain tourism (e.g. 'catch-and-cook'). The 'Păstrăvăria Bușteni' is a good example of a trout farm (https://www.pastravariabusteni.ro/) located in a mountain area (the Prahova River Valley) that is popular with tourists and therefore has a thriving business in direct sales of fresh trout and trout products - all registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT).   The key natural asset for a trout farm such as this is a clean (unpolluted) source of water - in this case, a local mountain stream draining a forested catchment area.    Value chains for mountains products such as the trout and trout products produced in the Busteni commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), bt this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
