Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 37 IT.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is 0. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is OFENA. In the Ofena basin and the sorrounding areas (350-550 m altitude), some hundred hectars of vineyards were recently planted by prestigious wineries of the coastal region (i.e. Masciarelli, Pasetti, Marramiero, Chiusagrande), joining their production to the historical properties like Cataldi Madonna and Gentili (now InAlto owned by the De Cecco pasta manufacturer). The area is raising increasing attention by the local and specialized press.   The size of the area (km2) is 36.9. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 349. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1756. The total population (in thousand) is 0.438. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 11.87. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -24.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 58.41. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -5.00%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8142. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6767. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 16.60%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 16.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 76.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 11955. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 29687.6. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 25.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 71.10%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 12097. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.22%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 43098. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 48. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.67%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 22.90%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.30%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 69.30%.   Viticulture was the principal culture of the mountain area in the past, then almost abandoned and presently we assist to a revival of the VC Climate change is giving this area some advantages, improving conditions for production of high quality grapes. Warmer average temperatures allow perfect maturation of the late harvest red varieties, but mountain environment keeps large temperature day-night excursion, for optimal aroma and color development. Together with one single producer who did not abandon the area, new vineyard settlements are observed, from investments of well established wine brands of the same region or from other sectors. Meanwhile, tourism in the region is increasing. The area is representative of many that had important viticulture lately almost abandoned but now rediscovered with retro-innovative solution.   the wine area is at the margin of Gran Sasso National Park and on the trekking path of Transumanza (tratturi), with a phenomenon of increasing turism. Together with wine, the region offers typical products like safron (di Navelli), the cheese Canestrato di Castel del Monte;.    The only technical challenge is same water shortage in the summer, when daily temperatures can overcome 40 C. Some social issues linked to the scarcity of local workforce due to depopulation of the mountain region, brought the main wineries to make use of worker cooperatives, thus reducing the positive impact of the value chain on the local economy. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Alternate row spontaneous cover crop in the vineyard, and reductive winemaking are the main innovative techniques introduced upon the traditional processes. Important investments in visitor reception (wine shop at the winery open every day) and in initiative to increase interest and liability of clients (special events, dinners restricted to best clients ecc.) were able to increase sales at cellar gate to almost 30% for the winery Cataldi Madonna. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland Natural land. The local assets include Natural."
