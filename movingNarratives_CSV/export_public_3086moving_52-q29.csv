Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 24 ES. The VC includes the farmers and the associated slaughter houses and selling points. It is mandatory te breed limusin, charoles or avileña (and autochthonous breed from the region) cows to be part of the certification. They must graze in natural pastures and the calves must drink milk from their mothers during the first 6/7 months. The slaughter occurs between the 12th and 18th months. The use of any kind of growing or fattening hormone is forbidden. The potential negative impact is the overgrazing in some plots. However, as most of the extension of the PGI belongs to protected areas, this aspect is controlled. Another important element of this VC is the mechanism of control and labelling conducted by the certification organism (Indicación Geográfica Protegida Carne de la Sierra de Guadarrama).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra del Guadarrama. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Colemar Viejo. Colmenar Viejo is located in the transition from the periurban area of Madrid city into the Guadarrama Mountain region. It is dominated by open forests of oaks (dehesas) and a hilly landscape. The main urban settlement has grown recently due to its proximity and good communication with Madrid city via road or train.   The size of the area (km2) is 182,98. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 600. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1423. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 283.85. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 16.88%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18300.26. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1.118032. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.06%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 25.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 73.24%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified.

The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 32.9. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.56%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 21.53%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 76.91%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   Tne PGI Guadarrama is a quality certification linked to the Guadarrama Mountain Region. It consists of an extensive cow feeding in natural mountain pastures until they reach the fattening stage. The certification links the mountain range with a high quality meat with propper traceability.   Access to the markets and compete with meats that come from intensive farming and global markets. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The breed can take place only in the territories described by the PGI but the slughtering and product elaboration can take place all along Madrid region. The territories for the PGI include around 80 municipalities within Madrid Region, being most of them, but not all, located in mountain areas."
