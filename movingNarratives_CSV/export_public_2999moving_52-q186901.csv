Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 SER. Mountain trount value chain is nationally fragmented and dominated by small actors, with capacity of up to 1000m2. Out of this number many are not even registered. Their production ranges from very extnensive to semi intensive, and intensive, from lack of any mechanisation and treatment to fully organised fishpond productions. Fresh fish is sold usually localy and through HORECA sector, while bigger facilities are starting processing and packaging for more remote markets, as demain is increasing. The organic production is underdeveloped though an interesting niche market. Linkages with tourism are strong not only outlets for the final product, but also in promotion of sport fishery in the mountain regions which are in case of Bajina Basta protected as Natural Park and cross border regions of Drina river watershead. Some companies are even having their operations in both countries (Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia) using the best locations for the production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Dinarid mountains, mountain Tara. Heavily relying on the natural capacity of the mountain springs and waterflwos the trout production is very conditioned and interlinked with the fresh mountain water ecosystesm. There are several considerations to note, starting from the almost full conversion to production of invasive species such as RAinbow or California trout, to intensification of production in trout fish farms and in cages. Due to a water shortage in the summer period, as well as lack of aeration and oxygenation systems, production on a number of farms is 10 to 20 kg/m3, which means that farms only operate at partial capacity. Still this is considered to be a very high quality protein food and due to the strong potential for income diversification in mountain areas, as well as the market demand from HORECA, it is often a small scale bussines placed close to touristic areas nature protected regions all over Western Balkans. The production practices can be improved to reduce environemntal impacts to minimum. Apart from fresh fish there is processing by smoking, making fillets or pate which adds further value to the product. There is strong reputation and image of the product linked to the mountain regions and landscapes that can further power the growth of fish consumption per capita.

Fresh water trout is a high valued mountain product for premium local and national markets (mostly HORECA). The mountain streams and river flows are diverted as natural habitats of freshwater trout and often promoted as a bussines idea for income diversification in the ares with favourable natural conditions and waterflows. As fish consumption per capita increases, there is an increased interest for mountain trout both from local markets, and HORECA but also retail. There are more investments in facilitite, still the overall production is small both by volume and nubmer of operators. Often percieved as a solid bussines idea in the moutnain areas rich with fresh springs and water, this expansion trend is limited by natural capacities, that are stil significant and not valorised enough. As the production will grow, also will the pressures to mountain water flows and ecosystems. Trout production VC is fragmented and localized, with short channels linked to retail or restaurants. There is good potential for furhter improvement of processng (by ready for cooking, smoking, or other processing) or exploring organic or mountain labelling. Linkages to tourism are strong both to HORECA and to promotion of sport trout fishery on some locations.   The key asset are the mountain water systems and watersheads. There is a strong competition in their use with the small hydro power plants that have been constructed or approved for construction all over Serbia. The demonstration of another concept of use is very valuable aslo as a diversification of the rural economy in small scale establishments in mountain areas. Though very dispersed, the similar fish ponds are organised all over the mountain areas not only in Serbia but in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Being a border area, there is strong influence on cross border water management of such water flows.    Water management of mountain streams and waterflows becomes an issue of increased interest and value. There are diferent sectors competing , from energy through small hydro power plants, which present huge threat to mountain ecosystems and right to water. Use of mountain streams for fish production is linked to clear and not poluted waters and springs. The environmental impacts need to be monitored and considered due to challenges in water supply over summer months, possible pressures in releasing organic waste or intensive fish breeding. The production is situated within and in vicinity of protected areas, there are many small operators, often non regisered, with trend of expansion and production increase. The environmental and lanscape pressures are to be considered within future expansion to respond to the increased market demands. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Trout production is upscaling in vicinity of mountain streams, with introduciton of the invasive trout species that are more productive and resilient. There is growign focus to processing, smoking, finalisation through better packaging and cleaining (fish fillet). Organic production though interesting is still in rudimentary phases. Linkages to tourism are strong, and apart from intensive breeding, there are free water fishing opportunities of mountan trout that are increasingly popular. Water management and monitoring of water quality ting natural conditions offer possibilities for developing other high-quality production systems, including agroecological production, etc. Existing GI protection is combined with other standards like Halal in order to reach foreign markets. There are initiatives for starting e-commerce of the products from this area. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   VC is present in Montenegro, Bosnia and Hercegovina, but also other mountain regions in Western Balkans, rich with clear waters."
