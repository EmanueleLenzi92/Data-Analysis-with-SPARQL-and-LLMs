Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 IT. The VC is not dependent on other SES for its production process, but marketing strategies involve other VCs and even other neighbour SESs. The relevant actor is the farmer who produces high quality and organic honey and mean. Quality certifications are related to the organic production.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Central Apennines - Marche. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Fabriano. Fabriano is a municipality in the Province of Ancona, Marche region, in the Center of Italy. It is located in the middle of several mountains, about 75 Km Southwest of main regional city, Ancona.

A young farmer's son decides to produce high quality, organic honey by partly innovating his production with barrel-aged honey and distilling mead. Most of the honey production is done in the mountain area. The beekeeper establishes commercial collaborations with local activities or located in neighbouring regions, like dairy and catering activities. Barrel-aged honey is an innovative product, just as mead production is not usual. The marketing strategy adopted is based on commercial cooperation that brings together several players from different production chains (dairies, restaurants, etc.).   The farmlands are used to produce peculiar honey (e.g., sunflower honey), while forest areas are used for traditional honey (Acacia honey). The beekeeper's knowledge is applied to improve quality production, invent new products and marketing initiatives.    Climate change is a significant challenge for honey production because of its adverse effects on plants' biological cycles and drought. Climate change also including the need to move hives in higher areas to find certain plant varieties. This practice and put a strain on the bees' ability to resist in colder mountain zones. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The beekeeper wanted to improve his honey with the production of unique honey. He devised the process of ageing the honey in barrels to obtain a product with a special, intense aroma. He also adopted a marketing strategy involving other local agricultural producers (such as dairy farmers) or those in the tourism sector (restaurants) to combine his product with other excellent products and services. The products are also sold online, and the beekeeper has engaged in innovative promotion campaigns on Youtube. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and Knowledge acquired in educational and professional training together with a personal and amateur passion for beekeeping."
