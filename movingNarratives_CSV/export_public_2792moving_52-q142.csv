Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 FR. A not very active union gathers the firms. Due to a demanding market and the absence of production and trade rules, the activity is governed by the summer and export markets. The 'SES' are not mobilized as productive resources but they receive the nuisances of an activity with high emissions and carbon footprint (effluents, transport, etc.) for a variable impact on employment (training, job security, remuneration). The question is how to developp other value chains based on the mountain CV reputation ? Wich conditions and environementals rules ?.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the homogeneity of resources, driving skills, local breed and PDO products.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   Pork meat products made by big firms with imported raw material from lean pigs, destinated to European market. One part of them benefits of PGI since 2019. This value chain is part of a greater value: the reputation of 'Corsican charcuterie'. Can the reputation of a traditional mountain product be the object of a value chain shared with other actors of the larg sector (external or internal to the mountain)? What are the conditions of this sharing? The interest of this value chain is to analyze the coexistence of activities mobilizing a reputation value considered unique but having very different possible and negative impacts on 'SES'. The case expresses the relationships between value chains associated with mountain production and the local economy (non-mountain). Is it possible to design connections and under what conditions ? How do you think about sharing a reputation that originates from the mountains areas with other neighboring areas?.   The challenge for the sector is to link up with local breeders who supply meat adapted to the needs of mid-range deli meats and to link this production to local resources (acorns, cereals, other agricultural and agri-food resources). It responds to another issue of controlling costs and prices in an eco-conditionality situation (food inputs, effluents, etc.). Benchmarking issue towards production systems of the Italian 'suino pesante' type. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. This is a socio-technical innovation absent from Corsica: - new ways of raising animals (' suino pesante type') to provide meat suitable for dry sausages. - search for a form of organization and management to extend the sharing of the value resulting from the reputation of mountain productions to other players in the region.learning experiences and knowledge capital stocks existing in the area/region. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are mountain product reputatio. The local assets include Cultural.   Possible source of inspiration for farming methods and organization of the coordination of 'sectors' between breeders and firms in the sector: - of the 'Suino pesante' type (12-month-old pigs and cereals) - type 'Cerdo de la dehessa estremadura' ('bellota and pienso') To be considered at the scale of a small island economy."
