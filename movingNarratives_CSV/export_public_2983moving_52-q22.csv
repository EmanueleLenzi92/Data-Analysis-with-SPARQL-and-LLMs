Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 25 UK. Scotland is the UK's largest venison producer, of 3500 tonnes of wild venison and 70 tonnes of farmed venison. As of 2020 there were 97 deer farms in Scotland. As there are no natural predators for deers they are managed (through culling to maintain a healthy herd). Venison is a highy reputable product and the SQWV (Scottish Quality Wild Venison) scheme workd to ensure humane and proper standards are followed. Farmed and wild deer thrive in the mountainous landscapes of Scotland and several producers are based in Lochaber including Great Glen Charcuterie. They turn venison into charcuterie meats and they are great taste award winners (2020). Whilst Jahama Highland Estate sell wild venison butchery products (mince, burgers, steaks). The farmed and wild vension VC is very reliant on wider SES in terms of good relations with landowners, gamekeepers and tourist ventures and ensuring deer management practices are upheld sustainably. The UK venison market is estimated at £100million and deer management supports 25200 FTE jobs.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Lochaber. Lochaber is a region in the west of Scotland which features spectacular scenery, including the highest mountain in the UK, Ben Nevis, coastal areas and valleys. The area is a major destination for tourism and outdoor recreation. The largest town, Fort William, has a population of 10,340, which is slightly over half of the population of the LAU1 mountain reference landscape: the population density is very low in rural parts of the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 4654.827692. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -1. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1346. The total population (in thousand) is 19.805.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 29913. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 49.78%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 161. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.25%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.67%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 77.08%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Venison (both farmed and wild deer meat) is a highly reputable product. The vension industry has the Scottish Quality Wild Venison safeguard for ensuring humane and sustaianble practices from 'hill to plate' (for wild venison). Deer are synonymous with Scotland's mountainous areas and due to a lack of larger predators are thus managed for better land management. 50 Deer Management groups exist in Scotland made up of multiple landowners, gamekeepers etc. The venison VC interacts with the sporting game VC. New products (charcuterie meats) are created through new processes (i.e. drying and curring the venison) adopted from outside of Scotland. Furthermore, Great Glen Charcuterie use 100% venison meat (and nothing else) in their products. They also now sell their produce at delis, restaurants and farm shops across Scotland.   Natural: venison requires mountainous and 'wild' terrain for venison production as well as attractive landscape and scenery to add to the 'venison brand' (i.e. iconic views of Scotland). Vension production/ deer management requires a lot of cooperation across land owners, gamekeepers, tourist ventures, local communities, conservation groups etc. There are around 50 Deer Management groups in Scotland established for this cooperation. Cultural assets are the reliance on traditional knowledge for culling and processing practices. Also to maintain a link with Scotland's heritage -i.e. the deer are 'the monarch of the glen'.    Relies on good communication and strong relations across the value chain and any associated Deer Management group - negative imapcts may occur if such relationships break down. Relies on strong export market which could be imapcted by BREXIT/ COVID. Farmed venison takes two years to make a return on investment meaning is a difficult business to start. Overgrazing or overculling may be other challenges. Challenges related to climate change may mean the deer framing/ production could become too costly or the terrain/ climate may no longer be suitable. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. venison production is traditional, but production as charcuterie is innovative. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and other (for farmed deer). The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Wild and farmed venison is common across Scotland (i.e. Badenoch and Strathspey) and also links to the VC for game hunting. Farmed venison is also found within Newy and Mourne (LAU1 in Northern Ireland)."
