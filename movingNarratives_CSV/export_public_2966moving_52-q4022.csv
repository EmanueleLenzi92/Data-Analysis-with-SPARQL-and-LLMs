Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 UK. Fly fishing of wild salmon is an important value chain in the Scottish Highlands. Generally, the fish are caught and then returned to the river (relatively) unharmed to preserve fish stocks. Scottish Wild Salmon has Protected designation of origin (PDO). Much of Scotland's salmon fishing is conducted on the River Spey which is Scotland's second longest river. Salmon fly fishing season runs from February to September. Fly fishing in the area is through permits which can cost between £30- £500 each. Positives for area include economic value to area and involves range of actors.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Badenoch and Strathspey. Badenoch and Strathspey is a highly scenic area which is valued for outdoor recreation and wildlife, and contains large forests, the upper River Spey and parts of the Cairngorm mountains. The population is concentrated in Aviemore and other small settlements: most of the region is remote and is regularly affected by snow in the winter. The A9 road and railway line form key transport links to central Scotland and Inverness.   The size of the area (km2) is 2369.81324. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 148. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1281. The total population (in thousand) is 13.985. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 5.90. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 6.53%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 22078.39. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6416.79. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.37%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 35.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 63.63%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 15574. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 25.92%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 141. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.82%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.45%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.73%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Scottish wild salmon has a PDO. This is specifically for Atlantic salmon caught up to 1.5km from the coast of Scotland using specific methods.Fly fishing for salmon is popular on the Rivers Spey and Findhorn and relies on good condition of the river right from its upland starting point. Salmon fishing in Badenoch and Strathspey is important as a product derived from the natural asset (river/ water) and for territorial identity (i.e., PDO and tourist venture). It relies on good relationships across the chain i.e., local communitiy, estate owners, angler clubs, hospitality. Salmon that are caught are returned to the river (i.e., not kept and eaten to mainatin fish stocks).   Natural - importance of maintaining scenery for nice surroundings for fly fishing, maintaining quality of river catchment so fish stocks remain high. Social - good relations with communities and lacndowners for welcoming (and allowing access) tourists and sharing rivers with locals (and vice versa). Cultural - relies of traditional fly fishing methods and good local knowledge of good areas for salmon catches.    Activities on the upper levels of the rivers/ lochs can impact on the populations of salmon lower down (and then have a knock on economic impact). This could include chnages to the river course becuase of flooing/ potential flooding. If numbers of permits were to increase this may reduce the likelihoods of successful catches and again have a knock on economic impact. Less tourist numbers visiting due to COVID-19/ Brexit. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Traditional because fy fishing has occurred in these areas for many years. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Rivers. The local assets include Natural, Social and Cultural.   Fly fishing for salmon also occurs in other areas across the Highlands and Islands region including Aberdeenshire (River Dee), Caithness and Sutherland, Inverness and Nairn. Trout fishing is another Value Chain prominent in mountainous lochs including Badenoch and Strarthespey, Lochaber, Inverness and Nairn. Fly fishing for wild trout is also popular in multiple LAU1's across Wales."
