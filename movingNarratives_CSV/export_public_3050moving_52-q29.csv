Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 ES. The Virgin Olive Oil certified by the DO Sierra de Segura is obtained from the fruit of the Picual, Verdala, Royal, and Manzanillo de Jaén olive varieties. The fruit is harvested with little mechanisation in a staggered period between mid-October and mid-February. Average production in the area exceeds 20 million kilograms of olive oil. A total of 8000 producers are linked to the Designation of Origin, as well as 52 registered entities and authorised brands.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic Systems. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Beas de Segura. The Sierra de Segura is part of the Cordillera Prebetica mountain range, with a very rugged topography with high average altitudes (899 metres) and steep slopes, ranging from 520 metres to altitudes of 1809 metres. The area of olive groves protected by the Sierra de segura Designation of Origin (created in 1979), covers some 40,000 hectares, belonging to more than 8,000 registered farmers, spread over 14 municipalities in the province of Jaén. The average production in the area exceeds 20 million kg of oil. Mountain olive groves have lower yields and higher production costs. However, on the other hand, they have a higher rainfall and milder summers, and harvesting techniques are used to avoid contact between the olives and the ground. All of this contributes to obtaining A PICUAL WITH CHARACTER, oils with their own identity. In addition to the generic certification, they certify early production virgin olive oils and other specific certifications such as KOSHER for the Jewish market.   The size of the area (km2) is 159.25. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1274. The total population (in thousand) is 5.1. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 33.02. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9194.23. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 10686.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 14.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.48%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 244. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,04%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1183. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 119.5. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.11%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 21.62%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.27%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   Successful registration of a pioneer quality scheme; traditional olive grove cultivation in combination with a protected area; climate change may favour high-altitude cultivation, maintenance of biodiversity and complementarity. Early harvesting has been a major step to bring forward the cycle and obtain extra virgin olive oils. The certification of this process is a milestone in terms of guarantee and marketing, as well as the availability of its own panel of tasters and a collective sales platform at the service of certified companies.   The olive groves are located on slopes (50% of the surface area is on slopes greater than 40%). Almost 50% of the area protected by the Designation of Origin (38,819 ha) is included within the Segura, Cazorla y las Villas Natural Park (16,000 ha). The mountain character facilitates the conservation of the natural, urban and cultural environment.    The main challenge is the generational changeover, which leads to the increasing abandonment of land; in addition, pest treatment without using aerial means and reducing chemical products; mechanisation is almost impossible and irrigation is deficient. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. It certifies early harvest olive oils; it acts as an online sales platform for certified companies; it has an accredited tasting panel; it is the oldest Designation of Origin in Andalusia (1979). The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The Sierra de Segura Designation of Origin comprises the municipalities of Arroyo del Ojanco, Beas de Segura, Segura de la Sierra, Benatae, Chiclana de Segura, Génave, Hornos de Segura, La Puerta de Segura, Orcera, Puente de Génave, Santiago-Pontones, Siles, Torres de Albanchez and Villarrodrigo, all of which belong to the province of Jaén. Other Mountain Reference Regions in Spain have Designations of Origin totally or partially certifying olive oils produced in mountain areas (PDOs Sierra Mágina, Sierra Cádiz, Priego de Córdoba..)."
