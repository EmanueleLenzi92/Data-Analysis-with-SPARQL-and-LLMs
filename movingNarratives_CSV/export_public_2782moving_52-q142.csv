Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 FR1. Picodon AOP is a goat-milk cheese from the Drome, very representative of middle mountain agriculture.The quality label AOP provides strict requirements in terms of production practices (type of goat, refinements, cultural practices, pasture, animal feeding..) and promotion and marketing in and out of the territory. The VC is well established and structured by farmers unions (Syndicat Caprin, Syndicat AOP Picodon.) and dairy cooperatives. It can be either marketed in long distribution channel or local market. In fact, one can find a great diversity of producing practices: organic and farmer Picodon or convention dairy picodon production. In 2017 the marketed production was 532 tons, or nearly 9,000,000 picodons, of which nearly 1,600,000 were produced by the appellation's farm producers and sold at the region's markets. Pastoralism practices are very well developped in the territority, namely by farme Picodon producers, but suffers from strong pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, pasture's impact on biodiversity. However, the opportunities is to show that pastoralism can provide ecosystemic services (sylvopastoralims, goat pasture prevent from fire starts).

Picodon AOP is a goat-milk cheese produced in Drome Prealps and protected by an AOP (appellation d'origine protégée) which provide strict requirement in terms of production practices and marketing. Picodon is a very famous cheese, contributing to Drome territorial identity. Picodon AOP VC is well organized by producers associations and trade unions and can be either marketed in long distribution channel or local market. Within this VC, one can find organic and farmer Picodon or convention dairy picodon production. Products: Some Picodon producers are working of goat meat valorisation (cabri, chevreau) Processes: Farmer Picodon producers are developping practices that provide ecosystemic services ecopasture, sylvopastoralism.   Cultural: Picodon is one of the most famous speciality in Drome departement which provide cultural asset: turistic attractivness, ancestral know-how, territorial identity, dedicated events. Natural: The AOP requirements guarantees production practices protecting middle mountain agriculture. Organic picodon producers also provide ecosystemic services: hampering fires thank to pasture practices, preservation of middle mountain agriculture.    Picodon AOP is a well-structured VC as goat-milk production is one of the top production in Drome which provide local economic value and territorial identity. However, this VC is very large and gather diverse producers: Farmers' Picodon producers often practice pastoralisme and Dairy Picodon producers working in dairy companies. Actors of this VC suffers from pressures: predation (wolf), droughts, impact on biodiversity,disease and parasite. Another challenge is the valorisation of goat meat in order to respond to consumer questions as well as the need to diversify for small producers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified.
