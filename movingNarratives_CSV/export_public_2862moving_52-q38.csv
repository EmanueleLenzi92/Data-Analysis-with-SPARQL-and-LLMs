The company has large relevance for the Sicilian economy. It produces both traditional and PDO-certified cheeses as well as standard products in the cheese sector, like mozzarella cheese. It uses local milk (sheep and cow milk) for high quality products and, if necessary, it is also uses extra-regional milk for standard productions. Milk comes from selected farms. The company is certified with various production quality labels (like BRC and IFS certificates) and it is active in the large-scale retail trade and the Ho.re.ca. sector for the local market. The innovation refers to both Sicilian PDO products and special cheeses like low-fat or lactose-free cheeses. In particular, products like the Provola cheese of Nebrodi is used in the marketing strategy to characterized the company as a producer of traditional Sicilian cheeses.   The company has a commercial relevance for the whole Sicilian dairy sector due to its large production. The cultural elements linked to the dairy tradition are incorporated into the industrial process to offer PDO cheeses and other local products.    Zappalà offers a wide selection of cheese to satisfy different types of consumers, both looking for high quality and certified products and those less interested in these aspects. The milk is collected in the entire regional territory and, if necessary, comes from the extra-regional areas. In this sense, several SES are concerned by the VC. The milk and cheese market is quite competitive, and it requires both a continuous proposal of new products and to enlarge the selling market. For these reasons, some doubt were arisen on the non-transparency on milk's origin, specifically for traditional cheese production, like the Provola cheese of Nabrodi. It shows a difficult connection between the large-scale retail trade, dairy industrial production and traditional local high quality food request by the market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation process concerns enlarging the commercial offer considering both PDO products and the demand of diet-conscious costumers (e.g., low-fat or lactose-free cheeses, etc.). Communication on the web/social is limited. Innovation is based both on existing knowledge in the Sicilian tradition and on educational and professional training of owners. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Cultural and Commercial relation power of Zappalà company in the SES."
