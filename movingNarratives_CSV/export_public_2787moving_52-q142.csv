Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 FR1. The poultry farming VC is developping in the Drome Valley. This production was favoured for farmers who do not have access to water. This production (hen egg and meat) is mainly organic and respond to local and national demand. It is either produced by diversified or specialized exploitations. The positive impact of this VC is the adaption to climate condition and poor access to water in the region. It also answer a local and national demand. In terms of environnement, poultry farming in diversified exploitation is a great complement of green manure. At the Biovallee scale, the VC is structured by the cooperative Val Soleil with 185 adherents in the poultry VC. The cooperative model allows farmers to have a security: guaranted incomes; shared material; adapted marketing strategies. The cooperative is managed by farmers with a democratic principle 'one person, one vote'. Eggs filiere counts 120 000 free range hens, 40 000 green label hens and 125 000 organic hens. Eggs are saled under two brands 'oeuf de nos villages' and 'cocorette'. Regarding chicken meat, chicken are raised and slaughtered locally and feed with local food production (139 farms, 2 slaughtered houses). 7 quality labels exist such as red label, organic, 100% vegetal..

The poultry farming in small structures was developped by farmers with no acces to water who adapted to water access condition and to answer strong consumer demand for local aviculture products (egg and meat). New processes: shared cultural technics and tools; adaptation of the production; valorization of meat of laying hens New marketing strategies: developpement of poultry farming to answer a local and national demande New governance systems: cooperative model gather farmers to market their production at local scale, guarantee steady incomes and shared means of production.   Natural asset: Organic poultry farming a small scale is complementary with diversified vegetable production: green manure, poor water demand Social asset: local production to answer national and local meat and egg demand, creation of local value in the territory.    The poultry farming VC is a good example of a production adapted to climate change condition (water scarcity). Farmers are currently converting to this production with a local marketing strategy in order to answer local and national demand for poultry products. This developpement strategy is carried out by farmers and cooperative actors. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Poultry farming integrated in cooperative model is innovative as it allows farmers to produce with a granted incomes, with shared cultural technics and tools and shared vision of the marketing strategies corresponding to local demand. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and social."
