Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 AT. Only registered animals can take part in the beef quality program approved by the Agrarmarkt Austria (AMA). The oxen come from suckler cow husbandry and are hired by the fatteners in spring and autumn (in sum there are approx. 350 small scale farms engaged). The approximately 1.000 animals slaughtered each year spend half of their life with their mother before they are fattened. It is fed with grass and maize silage and a bit grain. The oxen are slaughtered at an age of 22-24 months . The current population of Murbodner cattle in Austria is around 4,500, of which around 3,400 are dams. The oxen meat from Murbodner beef is available under the brand Landbeef Österreichisches Rindfleisch für Genießer (transl.: Landbeef Austrian beef for connoisseurs ). The meat from the Murbodner oxen is only available three to four times a year and is marketed on-farm, through regional food retailers (only in Styria and southern Burgenland) and through regional gastronomy. Young oxen from Murbodner or crossbred animals are also popular for special branded meat programs (e.g. ALMO see VC 01 AT), thus there are linkages to other high quality meat production initiatives.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Murtal (No: 620). Murtal is a very young district that was created by merging two former districts. The district is named after the river Mur The Mur valley is bordered in the north by the Niedere Tauern, by the Gurktaler Alps as well as the Styrian Randgebirge (Seetlaler Alpe, Stubalpe, Gleinalpe). The alpine to high alpine region is located in the western part of Upper Styria at an altitude between 800 and 2700 m above sea level. The region is characterised by a southern alpine climate. The valley areas show cold, continental weather with temperature inversions in winter and moderate temperatures in summer. Compared to the other landscapes of Styria, the Murtal is one of the landscapes with the lowest precipitation in Styria. The mountain flora is conditioned by the soil and climatic conditions and is characterised by a variety of alpine plants.   The size of the area (km2) is 1675.7. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 318. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2552. The total population (in thousand) is 71.698. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.79. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.01%.

The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.48%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.86%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 34467. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 22.16%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1840. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 90. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 7.87%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   Murbodner is a cattle race and label at the same time conducted by an association of breeders. The cattle are marked with an official mark (ear tag) in accordance with the Austrian Animal Identification and Registration Ordinance 2007 and are recorded in a database. Murbodner cattle is the result of traditional knowledge about cattle breeding and husbandry in Austria.The Murbodner cattle is an autochthonous breed of cattle from Austria. The close connection with the geographical area and traditional knowledge is of particular interest: Special soil and climatic conditions result in a rich local flora, which enables the extensive keeping of Murbodner cattle on pastures and alpine pastures. the cattle are fed with feed such as hay, silage and grummet, which come from the region. Due to this way of husbandry, beef with characteristic features in terms of composition can be produced. The meat of Murbodner beef is of culinary high quality. The rearing of Murbodner cattle is the result of traditional knowledge that was passed on to those who work in this area: Traditional knowledge and experience of animal husbandry (adaptation of the herds to the conditions of the environment, know-how of the farmers, type of beef production, improvement genetic material), the butcher's know-how (animal transport, experience in slaughtering, cutting, meat maturing) and the experience of the Murbodner cattle breeders' association.   The Murbodener adds value to the meat, which is of particular relevance as it is all small scale farms, which are engaged in this initiative. Moreover, it contributes to landscape preservation through pasture farming, and it hold up the cultural heritage by preserving an autochtone cattle breed.    Predicted changes in climate (extrem weather conditions: drough, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Protection of an endangered autochtone domestic livestock breed: The innovation lies mainly in the protection and preservation of the genetic make-up, and the related marketing structure. Is the uptake of breeding of this ancient Austrian cattle breed, which dates back to 4th century BC. It became widespread in the Eastern Alps and Alpine foothills, and was recognized as a Styrian local breed in 1869. After the WW2 the Murbodner was quickly displaced by Fleckvieh. The last breeding organisation dissolved in 1970. In 1982 the Austrian National Association for Gene Reserves started a preservation program for Murbodner breed. Since 2003 the Murbodners managed by Murbodner Breeders Association. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Some of the beef farmers are located in the neighbouring provincies of Carinthia and Lower Austria."
