Berries grow naturally in this environment so its market-oriented production is a possibility for local economies to thrive. The pick up yourself format can be seen as a marketing strategy as they are selling the whole experience of harvesting your own fresh raspberries. The new products relate to the frozen raspberries and the variety of juices they offer. Although these products already have extisted out there, it is interesting how they have integrated all those options in a family business.   The main asset of this VC is the cooperation between producers of the valley under the association AUK - SMAKER FRA STJØRDALSFØRET. They share values of sustainability and care for the valley and for the tastes that come from it. Berries are the natural asset for this VC.    The big challenge is to compete with greenhouse berry production, big Norwegian companies and the import market. Besides, global warming may bring new patogens and diseases to Nordic latitudes, and thus, production without spraying may become even more challenging. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Firstly, the farm offers the possibility of picking up the fruits yourself.
