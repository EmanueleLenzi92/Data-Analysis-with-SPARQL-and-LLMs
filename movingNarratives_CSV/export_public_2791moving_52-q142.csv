Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 FR. The activity is organized around actors constituted in several forms of organization which are in relation or not. First, the organization of the PDO which brings together breeders who make charcuterie according to breeding rules (nustrale breed, slaughter age, chestnut / acorn) and manufacturing (dry salt, ripening etc.) . Then, the breeders who make charcuterie inspired by tradition and finally the processors who import carcasses of pigs for a generic charcuterie. The reputation that guides the value chain is not under shared management. Animal feed resources are the captives of increasingly reduced PDO producers (club). How can reputation be a lever for sharing the value and sustainability of local resources?.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the homogeneity of resources, driving skills, local breed and PDO products.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   Corsica is one of the very rare regions of France to have chosen and obtained a dry charcuterie PDO. These are 3 distinct PDOs corresponding to 3 traditional pieces (coppa, lonzu and prisuttu). Others certification projects are underway for the protection of other products (sausage, ficatelu, etc.). This dynamism is due in particular to the strong originality of the farming system based on slow-growing animals and users of spontaneous resources in an open environment (chestnuts, acorns, beechnuts, etc.) and local breed (nustrale). This dynamism is also due to the existence of a great variety of farming methods and processing practices more or less derived from old productions (animals of local breeds, chestnuts, dry salt processing - use of imported raw materials wich imitated traditional products and intermediate forms, exogenous breeds slaughtered younger (8-10 months) etc.). These product are made by small-scale on-farm processors from local pigs (nustrale breed), reared in extensive conditions with chestnuts and acorns. The 3 PDOs are exemplary of the association of domestic animal and plant biodiversity (spontaneous and cultivated resources) and traditional knowledge (processing and tasting). The interest is linked to the coupling between the different human and non-human components on which the market and environmental value is based.   The value chain is linked to an organized association of different components. The challenge is to maintain the coupling of farming, processing and reputation of the products and managing the resources of the environment, in particular the chestnut grove and oak trees. And to succeed in the use of collective resources such as the chestnut or oak grove. Chestnut is struck by the cynips disease and threatened with degeneration (old orchards). How to constitute a common chestnut groves between harvest and breeding?. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovation consisted in defining a breed standard (nustrale), in qualifying strategic breeding periods (slaughter age, finishing feed, slow growth) in adopting new processing techniques (gentle salting of the prisuttu) in defining the products in terms of physicochemistry and taste, to build a distinct market identity for each of the 3 PDOs. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry (the chestnut grove must be conceived here as a domestic forest). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Italy (Cinta Senese, Piemonte), Spain (Sierra Morena) and Switzerland (Jura)."
