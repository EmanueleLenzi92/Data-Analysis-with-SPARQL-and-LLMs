Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 AT. The fact that Styrian viticulture has now achieved international renown is largely thanks to the STK (Styrian Terroir and Classic Wine Estates) association. The 12 STK wineries, including the Wohlmuth winery in Kitzeck, pursue the goal of vinifying wines of unmistakable character and bringing out the typical features of the terroir. Founded in 1986, STK initially stood for fresh, fruity and typical white wines. With the classification of the single-vineyard wines, based on the Burgundian system, the premium segment of Styrian growths is now also defined and recognisable by a quality mark: The 'STK', which is printed on the capsule or on the label.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Kor Alps. Kitzeck-Sausal is the coolest local appellation in southern Styria and is strongly influenced by the alpine air streams. Most of the vineyards are located at altitudes between 400 and 650 metres above sea level, which creates a unique microclimate. The heat-storing slate soil and steep southern exposure, combined with the coolness of the Alps, create large temperature differences between day and night. This is expressed sensorially in a diverse and intense aroma as well as mineral tension. The vineyards are characterised by rare, phyllitic slate - reddish and black in colour, thin-leaved, partly more compact, with inclusions of quartz, sericites and potash feldspar.

The municipality of Kitzeck im Sausal is located in southern Styria and is the highest wine-growing district in Austria. Well-known wineries have helped the wines from this village to achieve international reputation. The quality system is based on that of Burgundy and is defined by the vineyard location, i.e. the close appellation of origin. The main innovation is to produce more sustainably in order to protect the climate and, for example, to use less fertiliser in the crops. The winegrowers also advertise it, which casts an overall positive image on the region.   Due to its special agricultural charm and the impressive panoramic view, the community became known in the 19th century. Through the development of the area in terms of transport, the improvement of the infrastructure of the village and through determined advertising, it was possible to create a further, economically significant mainstay with tourism.    More than 50 % of the cultivated area has a slope of more than 26% and up to 90%. These slopes make viticulture a special challenge, which is why it is often called Styrian mountain viticulture. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Tradiotional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. In this region, there is a mixture of traditional and innovative approaches. A lot of work is done by hand, and the wines are often made from traditional grape varieties typical for the region. On the other hand, there is a big movement of many winegrowers who have come together to practice natural, organic viticulture and fruit growing. 140 farms from 9 regions throughout Styria participate in the so-called LEADER project. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Vineyard area. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Many winegrowers from the surrounding villages also have vineyards in neighbouring Slovenia."
