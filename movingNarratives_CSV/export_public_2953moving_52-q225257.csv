Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 RO. Transylvania Lactate' pursues an integrated production-processing-marketing concept based upon managing as much of the value chain as possible from maintaining the High Nature Value pastures that the buffalo graze; making supplementary animal feed for buffalo; ensuring the health of the buffalo; managing all aspects of dairy production and processing, and; product distribution. The aim of this approach is to ensure the 'premium' nature of the Mozzarella, particularly the commitment to freshness, quality and excellence in taste . The processing unit is based in the small town of Rupea with good access to a main road. It is approximately 30 km from the buffalo farm in the neighbouring commune of Bunești. The processing unit is state-of-the-art, fully automated and compliant with all national and EU standards. Production teams are carefully trained - including in the specific manufacture of the Mozzarella which requires some manual processing. There is a well-equipped laboratory providing product analysis for each phase of production. A fleet of vehicles distributes products daily to selected retail outlets in central Romania.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Oraş Rupea in Braşov county (RO122). Braşov county is a hilly mountainous region (500 - 2000 metres altitude) located in the south-eastern part of Transylvania. The relief is a diverse mix of mountainous (35%), hilly (50%) and lower altitude plain areas (15%) with an associated land use of forests (mainly in the mountain areas), permanent grasslands (mainly in the hilly areas), cultivated arable fields (in the hilly areas and lower altitude plains and hill areas) plus some urban, industrial and water surfaces (lakes and reservoirs). A very specific feature of this VC is that it originates from a location in the historical triangle formed by the fortified Transylvanian Saxon cities of Rupea, Fagaras and Sighisoara - a sub-mountainous hilly area characterised by a more diverse mosaic landscape than other parts of Braşov county.

Successful introduction of a new high quality dairy product onto the Romanian market using a combination of local expertise from Romania plus expertise and investment capital from the UK. Mozzarella is a completely new mountain product for Romania and is being produced by one of the largest commercial buffalo herds in Romania. They have invested significantly in both developing i) their Mozzarella (especially perfecting the process in accordance with the specific characteristics of the buffalo milk produced by their herd in the Carpathians) and ii) an effective marketing strategy for a new premium dairy product.   Buffalo have been present in the Carpathians for at least 1500 years. They originate from the Mediterranean type of water buffalo and have become well-adapted to the mountain environment. Carpathian Buffalo are most commonly found on smallholdings and are valued for their sturdiness and high productivity / milk quality. Although valued locally, there are relatively few buffalo products on the market. Where they do exist they are mainly versions of well-known products such as yoghurt, sour cream and salted white cheese that are made with buffalo milk rather than sheep, cow or goat.    Maintaining the visibility and profitability of a premium product on the Romanian market is an ongoing challenge, especially in the face of cheaper imports of a speciality product such as Mozzarella. The dairy company, 'Transilvania Lactate' (https://www.transilvanialactate.ro/en/), therefore works in partnership with external experts from a management consultancy company (also providing communication services) and a lifestyle brand. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Mozzarella is a completely new mountain product for Romania. In particular, 'Transilvania Lactate' is the first Romanian dairy company to successfully produce a consistent Mozzarella product from 100% Carpathian Buffalo milk. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural."
