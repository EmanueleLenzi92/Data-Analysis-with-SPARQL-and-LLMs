Wine (6-7 month to be ready for sale) is produced from rosehips harvested (dryied after harvest) on the hillsides of Jesenik spa (local rosehips). 100 % hand made work produced by family business. The only large scale producer of rosehip wine made in Czechia and Europe (two quality medails from USA). Non-filtered. The VC demonstrates how exclusive (unique) mountain product might address also global arena (awards in USA), although it is made out of rosehip which grows everywhere. The VC utilised the reference to mountains (clean air) in term of specific rosehip attribute. Simple production necessitates to know amount of suggar to be added. No additives to make wine are used to be trully regional product. Only hand made production and links to spa industry. Marketing uses references to natural landscape of the mountains.   Rosehips are everywhere, they are used to make tea. This VC is an attempt to make wine out of them. The specificity is not in the rosehips but in the way of what is the final product out of them.    Result of the search for exclusive fruit wine of the family (attempted to produce normal fuirt wines and finaly found roseship wine which is rich in flavour - it makes its exlusivenss). Utilize references to 'the clearest air in Czechia' and famous Jesenik spa (Priessnitz sap - V. Priesnitz was the founder of natural healing - healing though manual work, frech air and clear mouninit water). Example how regional product of alternative type (not normal wine but rosehip wine) can be attractive outside the region. Sold as exlusive products for gifts (in spa). Exslusiveness, uniquess. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation is the result of search for exclusive fruit wine (produced not from traditional fruits but from rosehips). As such is turned the understaning of what is exclusive fruit wine in terms of hand-mane and long time (8 month) to be metured. It is a new product for sale. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are rosehip bush. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The company also produces typical fruit wines (black currants, strawberies) but the fruits are not local (purchase dfrom Czechia and Slovakia)."
