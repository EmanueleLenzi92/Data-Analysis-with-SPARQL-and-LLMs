In the beginning, 30 years ago, 'Styria Beef' was supposed to be a brand for a quality beef product in order to improve the marketing of the products and increase/secure the income of the participating mountain farmers. 'Styria beef' then changed very quickly to a quality label for organic beef products in Styria. Meanwhile, there are about 700 farmers selling under the label Styria Beef. The distribution is diverse: direct selling, via supermarkets and restaurants. This VC covers the whole area of the federal state of Styria. Styria beef is one of the first initiative that introduced suckler cow husbandry. Due to the difficult beef market situation in the 1980s Styria Beef was founded as a quality beef brand that didn't to take long to become an organic brand. The marketing of the product using a set of channels: direct marketing, restaurants and supermarkets.   Since this VC extends throughout the federal state no specific answer can be given. However, Styria beef can be seen as a community since there is exchange among the farmers from the different regions. Further, the 'natural landscapes' are a key asset in the marketing of Styria beef. The feeding is used as argument for the special taste of the beef.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce Styria Beef provides in this regard a niche by producing and selling a premium product. Climate change is a challenge for pasture farms mostly in regard to biodiversity and logistically because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Some alpine pastures are used as ski slopes which is an overall challenge that might change in the course of climate change. An increasing artificial snow infrastructure is a challenge in regard to the 'beauty of the landscape. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The invention of 'Styria Beef' was a reaction due to the lack of quality beef products in the late 1980s in Austria. Styria beef has not only been representing itself as a new brand, but has set new standards in regard to animal welfare (suckler cow husbandry) that are now common in mountain farming practices in Austria. The innovation is related to New product and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural and social.   There are some farmers from the neighbouring federal states of Carinthia and Lower Austria supplying Styria beef."
