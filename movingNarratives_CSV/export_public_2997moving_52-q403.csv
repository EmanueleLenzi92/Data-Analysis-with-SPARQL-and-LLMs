Ivanjica potatoes (Ivanjiski krompir) are PDO registered product at Serbian level (Protected Designation of Origin). This potato has a long tradition of production and very high reputation in Serbia, as well as in the region. The territory is spread over 8 municipalities (LAU1 level) including two NUTS3 regions, but the central municipality of production is Ivanjica (LAU1), while surrounding municipalities have just parts of their territory under this production (bordering with Ivanjica municipality). It has a very long tradition of growing in this area / since the end of 19th century, when one of the major products for market were potatoes. Family farming is prevailing. According to the last Agricultural census conducted in 2012 in Serbia, 4.356,67 ha, this makes around 17% of the total prodcution of the potatoes in Serbia. Municipality of Ivanjica is part of Golija Mountain, which is protected as Natural Park (IUCN Ib protection), with its highest peak at 1.833m. Additionally at the territory of Ivanjica there is also protected Landscape of outstanding feature Mali Rzav (spring of river Rzav). Raspberry growing and forestry are also very important VCs in the area. Ivanjica is also known by the prefabricated houses, built from the good quality wood from the area. Climate of the region is humid continental with long and strong winter and hot and short summer. Ivanjica potatoes are very important for the area, as they are mainly produced by family farming households. Current situation is not favourable for the production, and it affect the quantities produced for a longer period. Import of potatoes from other countries brings the necessity to differentiate this product from the imported ones. This can be done by new marketing strategies, labelling, initiating organic production, etc.   Due to specific climate conditions, Ivanjica is exclusive European climate spa, with Institute for specific rehabilitation. The area is rich in mountainous rivers full with fish, making the area interesting for sport fishing. Landscapes and scenery are beautiful, attracting tourists, and that should be preserved. The area is full with minerals and possibilities for mining (antimony, craft stones, specific stones used for roofs, etc.). Almost 50% of the area is under forests, rich in non-forest products and wild animals, some of them are endangered species.    Prices of potatoes were very low in 2020, causing big quantities of potatoes in stock at the end of the season. Producers are facing problems due to the bad year, with additional burden of this remaining stocks. Areas under potatoes are reducing, and it can be expected that this trend will continue. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Certification of the Ivanjica potatoes as protected designation origin, and marekting under this label should bring added value and differentiation on the markets, both on national and international (especially if the product would be protected at EU level at the later stage). The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and Natural park and protected landscape of outstanding feature.   Potatoes are produced in oder mountain regions too, but Ivanjica potatoes have the highest reputation among customers, due to its high quality and taste."
