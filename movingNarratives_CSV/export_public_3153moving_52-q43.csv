Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 TR. The leading marketing channels of Karyağdı Pear used by the farmers are local merchants, followed by non-local merchants and companies. It is seen that they do not sell to the supermarket retailers. However, other retailers are used moderately in product sales. It is seen that the farmers also sell pears directly to the hotels since it is in the tourism region of Korkuteli. However, direct sales are very low. One of the marketing channels used less frequently by the farmers is the brokers in the wholesale market. Although Karyağdı Pear is a quality product, there is no awareness regarding the product. In other words, there are problems in generating demand. In 2018, a geographical indication certificate was obtained for Karyağdı Pear. It is expected that the geographical indication will help increase the demand of Karyağdı Pear. However, some initiatives are needed to increase the demand for the product. In addition, it is observed that Karyağdı Pear producers do not have a farmer organization.

Geographical Indication (GI) was obtained for Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear in 2018 (https://www.ci.gov.tr/cografi-isaretler/detay/38437). The most important distinguishing feature of Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear from other pear varieties is the absence of a sandy structure around the core. Another distinctive feature is that high productivity can be obtained without the need for any kind of pollinator. Approximately 11% of the pear production in Turkey (59405 tonnes) is produced in Korkuteli district (TurkStat, 2020).   Natural: Karyağdı Pear is grown in an area of 2000 hectares in Korkuteli. Average farm size per household is 1 hectare. Karyağdı Pear is grown in orchards. Social: It is known that Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear has been produced since the 1950s and that there are pear trees over 65 years old in Korkuteli. Social interaction has a great effect on the growing of Karyağdı Pear farms in the region. Currently, the number of farmers dealing with Karyağdı pear cultivation in the region is 550.    Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear producers have three major challenges. These are climate change, insufficient market demand and low product price. The biological balance in the region has been adversely affected due to climate change. For this reason, the pest population has increased in the region. Although Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear is a very high quality and special product, this product is less known in the market. In other words, market recognition of the product is poor. Therefore, the demand of Korkuteli Karyağdı Pear in the market is insufficient. This causes the product to be offered to the market at low prices.
