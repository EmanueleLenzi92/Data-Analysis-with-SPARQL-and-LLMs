The VC aims on production of syrups of various flavours. The syrups are presented as a regional product that uses herbs and fruits collected in mountains. It also refers to traditonal recipes for preparing the syrups. Alhough this product is not unique of mountain regions, it is a great example of utilizing natural and symbolic values associated with the region. In order to generate an unique selling proposition, the syrups are often marketing as a special regional product.   More important than the natural assets (that can be fairly easily substituted) is the social construction of quality that is used in marketing. For this purpose the producers refer to traditional knowledge embedded in the region, their product labels refer to cultural traits associated with the mountain area. The symbolic value refering to the mountains is what distingusihes the product from other similar products.    Syrups are sold on mainstream food markets that are highly competetive. Main challenge for the given VC is associated with valorization of the product and with a marketing strategy. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is not so important in terms of the use of natural (tangible) resources, but it is a typical example of the VC that is embedded in mountain region, but uses the intangible resources of the region."
