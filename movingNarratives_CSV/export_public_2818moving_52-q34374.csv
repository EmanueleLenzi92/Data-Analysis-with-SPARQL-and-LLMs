Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 GR. Prickly pear grows both wildly and is cultivated in Dicti mountainous terrain and on Crete. It is new farming activity and production of byproducts has not developed fully. The opportunities for production of this underused plant are varied and many. They include: The food and beverage industry; livestock feed industry; pharmaceutical industry; cosmetic industry (e.g. creams, shampoos and lotions from cladodes); food supplements industry (e.g. fibre and flours from cladodes); natural additives industry (e.g. gums from cladodes and colorants from fruit); construction industry (e.g. binding compounds from mucilage/cladodes); agricultural inputs (e.g. soils, organic materials and improved drainage from the use of cactus pear plant products); tourism sector (e.g. artisan crafts made from lignified cladodes); textile industry (e.g. use for natural colorants).Such activities and byproducts could have a more positive impact on regional SES and contribute to sustainability in that it is a plant that withstands draught and climate change. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Dikti Mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is VIANNOS. Dicti mountain range has a maximum altitude of 2,148. Large parts of the mountain area are forested with pines (Pinus brutia), Kermes oaks (Quercus coccifera), cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens), Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex) and Cretan Maples (Acer sempervirens).The topology of the mountain range is rich with plateaus, valleys and secondary peaks. The fertile valleys and plateaus of Dikti/Dicte are of significant importance in the local economy. Dittany adapts greatly and grows especially in thegorges, limestone soils and cliffs of the mountain. The size of the area (km2) is 221.5. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2148. The total population (in thousand) is 315.162.

The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13800. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 3752.14. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.39%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.64%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 82.97%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 14300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 7862.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 11.24%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 81.85%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 22. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.000%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 41162. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 55. In this region protected areas are present. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 15.23%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.38%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.39%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.97%.   Prickly pears are sustainable crops that can withstand drought and climate change in the Dicti landscape. Cactus pear grows on land where no other crops are able to grow, this renders it particularly suitable for the Dicti landscape. Prickly pears can be used to restore degraded land and poor soils.Cactus pear crops are gaining increasing interest due to popularity of byproducts that are of high nutritional, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical value. In the DIcti region prickly pears are grown in both agricultural systems and natural environment. They are crops that withstand drought and climate change. A cooperate has been established for the production of the numerous byproducts. The Minoan Land Cooperative processes the prickly pears to produce many byproducts including natural fertilizers. Prickly pear cactus is an underappreciated plant species. It is anticipated the development of future economic uses for both the pads and the fruit are very possible. Importance of the prickly pear cactus as a natural resource and as a potential source of income and employment. Prickly pear cacti have played a decisive ecological role in slowing down the rate of degradation of deforested soils. The entire plant including flowers, fruit (pulp and seeds), cladodes and needles can be processed to produce a variety of products. The Minoan Land Cooperation is the largest cooperation in Crete and exports the well-known product Opuntia Spirit, which is considered to be the Cretan Τequila. Opuntia Spirit is produced from the distillate of pickly pears, maintaining the intense flavor and aroma of the fruit. Hence, these new used of the plant bring two culturally significan communities of practice together, the distilling practice and the prickly pear production by Minoan Land Cooperation.   Prickly pear cactus grows naturally in the rocky soil of Dicti area and othe areas of Crete. The pads are a highly-prized commodity in the dairy industry (that is highly developed in the region) and are used for animal feed. Culinary and nutraceutical uses have great potential, juice, jams, liquors. The eatable and cosmetic products are readily used and sold in the culinary tourist sector that is highly developed in the region. Prickly pear cultivation and wild plant harvesting can support and improve the livelihoods of rural populations by promoting and supporting agro- industries. Prickly pear cactus farming and byproducts in the Dicti area is recent and not well developed. The economic high yielding use of all the consumable parts of the plant in byproduct production pharmaceutical and nutraceutical is not well developed. The exploitation of prickly pear byproducts may support the local economy and contribute to the preparation of added value products of specific origin. More specifically, it's use in the production of food for livestock can decrease the cost and expenses of stockbreeders. However, there is no much demand by consumers for this product. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovative products produced from a plant that has been underused until recently. Products produced are of high nutritional and economic value. The natural fertilizers are also of high ecological value since the agriculutal sector is well developed on Crete and natural fertilizers are increasingly applied. Innovative pharmaceutical prickly pearl juices are considered of high importance in respect to the treatment of diabetes. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and possible ecological impact. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Prickly pear plants grow wild or are cultivated in southern Spain and around the Mediterranean in France, Greece, Italy and Turkey."
