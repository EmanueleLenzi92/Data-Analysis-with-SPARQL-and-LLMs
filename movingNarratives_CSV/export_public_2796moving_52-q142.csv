Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 FR. The reputation and the high price level of the essential oil of helichrysum from Corsica are linked to the image of the wild nature of Corsica. The value of production is low relative to the activities of distillation, trading and prescription of oils. The downstream power runs the risk of disembedding the activity and wild harvests to have negative impacts on the environment. What chain of values that are both fair and sustainable? The oil GI certification project was unsuccessful. The GI certification project for the oil did not succeed apart from a few AB oils, no protection, apart from industrial brands (cosmetics, perfumery, aromatherapy, etc.), does not guarantee collective protection.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the homogeneity of resources, dieseases impcats, driving skills, plants varieties and labels.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   The valuation of essential oils by distillery is recent in Corsica. Helicrysum is emblematic of the dynamics of the aromatic plant sector and enjoys a high market value for proven therapeutic indications (anti-hematoma, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, anti-lebbitic). At the beginning, samples were taken from spontaneous stands. The risk of resource depletion and the desire to guarantee production has led the institutions to finance plantations.However, the value of the oils obtained from the spontaneous plant seems higher. Elicryse addresses both a question of resilience in terms of market value and sustainability of the environment. Finally, the most profitable operation is distillation. It is therefore the distiller who benefits most of the value sensu stricto. The final value is the result of a combination of values of different natures: the culture of the nourishing tree, constitution of income, maintenance of ecosystems and management of space.   The challenge is to maintain the therapeutic qualities of the oils, to stabilize highly profitable production with a strong reputation, to preserve spontaneous stands of uncontrolled harvests and finally to prevent integration by large industrial operators. How to design a fair value chain between operators and maintain value in production areas?. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovation consists in maintaining a high level of quality and a reputation based on cultivated production on the one hand and in organizing a sector for equitable sharing of value on the other hand. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Natural land and Cultivation of helichrysum plantations. The local assets include Natural.   This VC is also present in other regions of France (Drôme) where about 100ha of Curry plant might be produced as well. It was identified in Italy, North Macedonia, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Spain.The activity can join other activities which mobilize in the construction of the value of the species existing in the spontaneous state and where the agricultural possibilities are not yet completely stabilized. PAM but also fruits like acorn can enrich the approach."
