The enhancement of the Montese potato was carried out through the redefinition of the organization of the production chain and the definition of a targeted promotion, as well as through an effective process of improving the quality and sustainability of the production process, the traceability and identifiability of the mountain product.

Emilia Romagna is the region with the hight production of potatos in Italy, following by Campania and Tuscany. The main production is done in flat and irrigated land but some producer have start to introduce some innovation also in mountain area help by specific PEI measure of Rural Development Programme (Regional) - Emilia Romagna. For many years potatos were considered as a commodity product with a basic price. Only the last years, to mitigate the reduction of per capita consuption, were introduce new marketing strategies based on the traciability of the product thanks to the valorisation of local productions. By improving the profitability conditions of mountain agri-food production it is possible to generate positive effects on the mountain territory by reducing its depopulation.   The research project, done under the RDP 4 , intends to provide the operators of the 'Montese Potato' value chain with some useful tools to improve the perceived value of their mountain product. In fact, with the adoption of the European brand 'Mountain Product' in conjunction with the 'Patata di Montese' brand, producers can improve the brand awareness of their customers and therefore the perceived value of their products. Furthermore, referring to the product packaging and distribution phase, the project aims to identify the packaging system and coordinate the collaboration with the distribution to increase the penetration of distribution in the points of sale and support producers in the development of appropriate marketing activities.    The farm located in mountain area as: Azienda Agricola Terrasanta, Azienda Agricola Veranatura, Azienda Agricola Belvedere and Azienda Agricola Farini d'Olmo have start to introduce new marketing strategies , using the label 'Mountain Product' (Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and Reg.(UE) n.665/2014). Other as Azienda Agricola Palazzino have decide to use a specific label done by the local Chamber of Commerce 'Patata di montese' to valorise the product. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The enhancement of the Montese potato was carried out through the redefinition of the organization of the production chain and the definition of a targeted promotion, as well as through an effective process of improving the quality and sustainability of the production process, the traceability and identification of the mountain products. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Social."
