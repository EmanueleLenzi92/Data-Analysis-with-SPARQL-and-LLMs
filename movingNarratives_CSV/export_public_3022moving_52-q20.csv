Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 16 SCA. This VC fosters the integration of outdoor recreations in wild nature with traditional practices and local products. Therefore, the VC seeks a tourism that boosts regional development based on local assets, trying to keep most of the economic benefits of the activity within the region. Many regional organisations work together with local producers and touristic buisiness and ski lodges along Norway. The actual emphasis on sustainable tourism tries to face overtourism and its impacts on natural ecosystems and local social systems due to over crowding.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Trysil. Trysil is located in the boundary with Sweden. It hosts the largest ski resort in Norway. Its economy is mainly based on services and tourism due to the natural assets of the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 3014.41.

It is a developing industry in Scandinavian countries based on their singular natural assets. In addition, it seeks to add value to other VCs of the area. The innovation is related to the sysnergies between cultural and natural assets, looking for a bigger implication and integration of visitors with the area. Websites play an important mechanism as all the touristic assets (from skiing to cow milking) can be found online. Regional associations play a key role in promoting both local products and also touristic assets under labelling schemes. Finally, with this place-based turn in tourism, more family businesses and local organisations are gaining importance in the management of tourism.   The specificity of this VC is the landscape of the region. The main asset in winter is outdoor recreation based on winter sports such as skiing (crosscountry and downhill skiing) or dogsledding. For these sports, Scandinavian mountains offer a great spot with extent routes and resorts during a particularly long season. During summer, other outdoor recreation activities such as fly fishing, hunting, and hiking are combined with the enjoyment of cultural landscapes and their associated practices (mostly extensive grazing) and products (dairies, meat, honey, etc.).    Tourism is an industry that relies on external visitors, therefore in times of COVID-19 Pandemic, its resilience has been highly questioned. However, it surely delivers multiple benefits to the localities when it looks for responsible visitors that aim to engage with the places they visit. Climate Change is a challenge as winter season may be shorter in the coming years and thus the arctic and snow based touristic sector will need to look for alternatives. In addition, sustainable tourism face challenges when dealing with the impacts of traveling (e.g., carbon emissions) and overtourism in specific locations. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovations are related with new tourism activities and approches, moving from traditional experiences and offers (such as simple outdoor recreation) towards local initiatives, products and practices that can add value to the touristic experience. The innovation is therefore about looking for these type of synergies. In addition, most of the touristic and accommodation offers are available online, even in the case of small family bussinesses and farms. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   More examples can be found almost all along Norway in municipalities such as Vadsø (LAU1 2003) and Oppdal (LAU1 1634 ), and within the Hardangervidda National Park (Uvdal LAU 1 0633, Ullensvang LAU1 1231 and others). Similarly, arctic tourism is a developing industry in Lapland Region in Finland (NUTS3 FI1D7) and Norbotten in Sweden (NUTS3 SE332)."
