Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 TR. Key actors: mushroom compost or compost material suppliers, spawn suppliers, companies, small-scale farmers, traders; producer union; retailers; consumers Key activities: Input supply, growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, logistics; marketing; sales; purchasing It is stated that 96% of mushroom production in Korkuteli is carried out by small family farms. 94% of the mushrooms produced in the region are sold to traders. The rate of producers trained in mushroom production is 9.4% (Şahin, 2019). The value chain has positive effects on the environment. Agricultural wastes (wheat stalk, chicken manure, cotton pulp, etc.) are used in compost production. These wastes are transformed into a product with high economic and nutritional value. The fact that the climate of the region is suitable for mushroom cultivation reduces the costs of climatization. The region is close to raw material sources for mushroom cultivation. This reduces logistics costs. The short shelf life of the product is a major disadvantage for small family farms. Because most of the small family farms do not have the necessary infrastructure for the processing and distribution of the product.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Bey mountains, Antalya. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Korkuteli. Korkuteli is a district of Antalya Province in the Mediterranean region of Turkey, 56 km (35 mi) north-west of the city of Antalya.Korkuteli is an area of small plains and hills in the Bey Dağları, the western range of the Taurus Mountains, overlooking the Mediterranean sea. There are two distinct geographical areas of Korkuteli, of equal size: the lowland area nearer the coast has a hot Mediterranean climate, while the larger area of lakes higher up is cooler and less humid. The high country is covered with pine forest, while the lowland is used for agriculture; crops include grains, pulses and vegetable oil-seeds. There are trout in Korkuteli reservoir and other small lakes (Wikipedia,2021).   The size of the area (km2) is 2471. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1020. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2000. The total population (in thousand) is 55.588. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 22.5.

The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 22425.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 8.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 19.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.00%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 8881.82. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 25421.01. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 21.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 66.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 599838. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 98.70%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 39533. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is Medium. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is Low. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is High. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 68.40%.   Korkuteli Region has a regional reputation with cultivated mushroom. In 2020, 60.44 % of the Turkey's cultivated mushrooms (55455 tons) are grown in Korkuteli Region (TurkStat, 2020). Mushroom cultivation is carried out by modern mushroom companies with fully automated climate systems. In addition to this, the climate in the region is suitable for high quality mushroom production and enables mushroom farming without climate control. Therefore, there are many small-scale farmers in the region. Also, substrate needed for cultivation is easily available, and tourism in the region increases mushroom demand.   Social: Cultivated mushroom production has been started with a few enterprises at the beginning of 1980s in the region. Both mushroom production and number of enterprises have been extended by community interactions.    Shelf life of fresh mushrooms are very short. Cooling for transportation is needed but the possibility of cooling transportation for small farms in the area is limited. Value added products such as canned and dried mushrooms products can be produced by only modern farms. Small-scale farmers procure the mushroom compost (or substract) required for production from modern companies. This increases the production cost. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Not arable land is needed for mushroom cultivation. Mushroom production do not require arable land. Small-scale farmers are carried out their production in growing rooms located under the houses they live. The local assets include Social.   Wild edible mushrooms are included in other MRLs in the Member State such as Switzerland, Hungary, North Macedonia, Portugal, Slovakia but cultivated mushrooms are not present in other's countries list. This value chain is only available in Turkey's MRLs list."
