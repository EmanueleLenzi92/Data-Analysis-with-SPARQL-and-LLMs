Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 SER. Livestock husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the area of Zlatar Mountain. Cattle breeding is at the basis of the VC, the biggest number of the farmer households is with 1-2 and 3-9 animals. There were 8.735 cattle in Nova Varos in 2018, but this number is declining. Out of this number about 6.000 are milking cows (6.224 milking cows according to the Farm structure suvery perfomed in 2018). Animals are grazed on natural pastures, with lot of specific wild herbs and plants (also medical plants), which leads to high quality of cow milk. As a part of the production systems, farmers produce Zlatar cow cheese in brine, which is protected as a PDO product at Serbian level. Farms are mostly owned by farmers and registered as agriculture households, and there are a couple of milk processing units registered (on-farm processing registered) and small dairies. Farm processing is traditional, and there is a possibility to have small house processing units registration (Serbia adopted regulative for small processing unit registration). They have to fulfil HACCP requirements. Cheese is sold at the green market, or through the middle man to the restaurants and direct buyers. Small dairies are also supplying the retailers (even some bigger retail chains). PDO registration and ongoing certification process will allow producers of Zlatar cheese to add value to their product, have specific marketing and labeling.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zlatar Mountain. Zlatar Mountain is in the territory of Nova Varos municipality, and partially Sjenica municipality in the NUTS 3 region of Zlatibor. This mountain has very good climate, with mixture of Mediterranean and mountainous climate, creating very good combination and popular touristic 'air spa'. Forests are spread on over 30% of its territory, while agricultural land is a mixture of natural pastures and meadows and arabling land. Besides livestock production, important is fruit production, NTFP and beekeeping. There are three lakes and three rivers that are very attractive for tourists. They are also creating beautiful landscapes. Special nature reserve Uvac is habitat of the endangered Griffon vulture, with one of the biggest vulture population in Europe. There are two caves Ušačka and Ledena cave. Food is traditional and specific for the area, known as healthy and of a good quality. Besides cheese, Zlatar area is known also by the buckwheat growing, and local traditional speciality - buckwheat pie. Population is multicultural with strong connections to neighbouring countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro). It is close to the big touristic centre - Zlatibor, which brings positive and negative impact - higher number of tourists, looking for less urabised areas for holidays, but, in the same time influence of rapid urbanisation of nature and intensive building of touristic capacities.

Zlatar Mountain is located in Western Serbia, and it is well known for its nature, air (mix of Mediterranean and continental air), lakes and beautiful landscapes. There is a nature reserve (IUCN Ia category) - Reserve Uvac (lake and meanders), home of endangered species / Big vultures. High quality products - beef meat, Zlatar cheese (PDO), medical herbs and buckwheat are important part of the agriculture production with high reputation and presence in touristic offer in Zlatar. Cows are grazed in natural meadows and pastures with very little concentrate food feeding. Significant touristic potentials due to natural resources (hiking, medical tourism, rural tourism, fishing, sustainable tourism). Family farming is prevailing with small dairies and on-farm processing. Zlatar cheese is highly rated in traditional restaurants and is present in restaurants in the area, as well as in Belgrade. During 2020 some e-commerce started on national level where producers from Zlatar increased their selling. Still, this needs to be developed and better organised (now it is relying on individual transportation means and logistics of the producers/farmers. There are specialised delicatessen stores in Belgrade and bigger cities that started to buy produce directly from producers. Zlatar cheese is registered PDO product at Serbian level, and it is a product of high quality and high reputation. Cows are grazed on natural pastures and are kept outside of the year. Specific composition of natural pastures brings additional quality to the milk for making cheese. There are initial actions for organising farmers in associations for certification of the cheese and PDO management and marketing. Zlatar Mountain is still not very urbanised and used for mass-tourism. Natural value of the area is very big - special nature area, endangered species, three lakes and a river. Pollution and climate change are also threatening the area (waste management, river pollution, etc. The area is on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.   Key local assets are multi-cultural area, with connections to the neighbouring countries Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Traditional knowledge on livestock farming and production of traditional products (cheese) is kept in families. Agriculture is mostly extensive, using natural pastures and feeding. potentials for rural tourism with low carbon print. Lakes (three artificial lakes, but of a great beauty) Zlatarsko, Uvačko and Radoinjsko play mportant role in tourism, as well as in landscape preservation. Beautiful landscapes and forests are specific asset of the area.Production of buckweet.    Cheese production is mostly done on-farm, and there are few small processing units registered on farms. There are a few small dairies in the area. Number of cattle is reducing, as well as number of people in rural areas who are keeping animals. In last couple of years there are some attempts to organise farmers and create farmer organisations for managing PDO Zlatar cheese, increase its visibility and prevent misuse of the name by other cheese producers outside of Zlatar area. Tourism is increased in last couple of years, but it is not always done in a planned way. Parts of Zlatar Mountain are rapidly being urbanised. Natural assets are protected, but there are some incidents that are endangering the wild life and protected species (big vultures in the park). Certification and legal protection of the Zlatar cheese in the market are priorities for the Local self-government and farmers from the area. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Grazing of livestock on natural pastures is major production system; Farmers are starting to be involved in the cheese protection, but also, many of them are finding ways to sell cheese to restaurants and delicatessen shops in big cities. Transition to organic production is not requiring large investments, nor change in animal breeding. There are initiatives for organised organic production. The area offer possibilities for developing other high-quality production systems, including agroecological production, etc. Existing GI protection can be registered at EU level, and can be combined with other standards in order to reach foreign markets. There are initiatives of e-commerce of the products from this area (especially during Covid-19). The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and Habitat of endangered species."
