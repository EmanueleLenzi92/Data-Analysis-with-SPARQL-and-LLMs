Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SLOVAKIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 SK. Key activities: beekeeping, bee products processing, marketing , sale. Key actors: beekeepers, land owners, consumers. Positive impact on local and regional SES is in employment and on ecological sustainability. The VC depends on local and regional vegetation with low pesticide use.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Slovak Carpathians. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Važec. The Važec is lined by the highest Slovak mountains, 'Vysoké Tatry.' The municipality includes a karst cave declared as a National Natural Monument with guided visits for the public; there is also a ski areal for winter skiing.

The trademark 'Slovenský med' (Slovak honey) can be used by registered beekeepers in the Slovak Association of beekeepers (SZV) who sell honey from their production. The trademark is registered as n. 214649. Number of registered beekeepers has been increasing over last years in Slovakia. Due to the lack of intensive agriculture in the mountain areas and more forests and meadows, the honey from this area has higher quality. Currently, the government lanced a project promoting a reintroduction of beekeeping in woods.   Natural asset are vegetation land use systems. Social asses are consumers demand for bee products from national production and cooperation between beekeepers.    1) The beekeeping challenges are similar to those in other countries, which is an extensive death of bee colonies due to the sharp temperature fluctuations and pesticides in agriculture. The current losses are also influenced by pollen's weak diversity, caused by single-species cultivation of crops, parasites, or bee diseases. 2) Beekeepers have problems getting their products to market. The reason is mainly the import of cheaper and often low-quality honey from abroad. Some websites provide information (address, contacts, products, etc.) about beekeepers who sell their products directly to final consumers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as N/A.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. State supports beekeepers and beekeeping in forests. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and social.   The beekeeping is practically present in all mountain NUTS3 in Slovakia: SK 022, SK 031, SK 032, SK 041, SK 042."
