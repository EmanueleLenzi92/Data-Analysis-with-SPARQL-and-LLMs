Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 50 ES. The 'Asociación de Propietarios para la Regulación Micológica Conjunta Montes de Soria' is a non-profit organization that works to ensure the best possible management of the mycological resources of its members. In addition, it facilitates the control and surveillance of the activity, both harvesting and buying and selling goods, and collaborates with the competent administrations in the matter. The Association issues valid permits for the collection of mushrooms in most of the province of Soria. Specifically for the forests regulated in the enclosures SO-50.002 and SO-50.003. The different types of permits have been established by the owners of the forests and are revised annually. They take into account criteria such as the collector's roots in the area, the sporting or commercial nature of the collection activity, the amount to be collected and the duration of the activity. It also promotes mycotourism activities. The mushroom season in Navaleno lasts almost all year round. There is a local company that acts as a market for the purchase and sale, another company specialized in processing and numerous restaurants including one with a Michelin star.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Iberian System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Navaleno. Navaleno is located between the Sierra de Cabreja, the Picos de Urbión and the Cañón del Río Lobos Natural Park. The Bosque del Pinar Grande is nearby, with an interpretation center and mycological reserve. In the area of the Montes de Soria, old traditions regulated the use and enjoyment of the public utility forests, including small 'suertes de pinos' for the enjoyment of the families, who obtained important incomes thanks to the sale of the wood, complementing the family economy thanks to the cattle raising and the mycology among other activities.   The size of the area (km2) is 25.03. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1100. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1300. The total population (in thousand) is 0.768. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 30.68. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.15%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 25.42. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.06%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21963. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2154.5. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 8.24%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.86%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 60.90%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 12003. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 52920. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.21%.

Non-wood forest products (NWFPs) such as cork, resins, gums, wild mushrooms, aromatic and medicinal plants, and wild nuts and berries provide a multitude of social, cultural, environmental and economic contributions to human, economic and nature conservation in Europe. In this sense, it is important to recognise, and to leverage, the potential of non-wood forest products to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and notably to rural development, nature conservation, human well-being, and all of that in line with the European Green Deal.   Navaleno is one of the main mycological habitats of the province of Soria; it is the forest mass of black pine and Scots pine of the region of Pinares. These pine forests are very good producers of Lactarius deliciosus (or Níscalo or amizcle), which together with the relative proximity of Soria to the Catalan markets, where it is highly appreciated, makes it the most important species from the economic point of view of these forests. Other species of the genus Hygrophorus, llanegas, Tricholoma equestre (or Seta de los caballeros), qualified from the culinary point of view as 'excellent', Tricholoma terreum (or negrilla), qualified as 'good edible'; and, although in smaller quantities, you can also find Boletus edulis (or Miguel or White Mushroom) culinarily qualified as 'excellent' and Boletus pinophilus (or Miguel or Red Mushroom), also qualified as 'excellent'. The Mycological Days are held every year and in 2007 the Navaleno Mycological Center was inaugurated, which houses a permanent exhibition on the world of mushrooms and organises courses related to the fungi world.    Firstly, ensuring a positive economic, social and environmental impact on the territory, through the distribution of income among the municipalities, maintenance of an improvement fund and other aspects related to promotion and dissemination. Secondly, making more transparent and regulating the purchase and sale market in accordance with the different Municipal Ordinances. Thirdly, ensuring compliance with national and regional regulations regarding traceability and food safety. Finally, deepening the knowledge of the resource in order to develop strategies for adaptation to Climate Change. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Different innovative initiatives have arisen related to: the traceability control system thanks to the development of computer applications; creation of species identification centers; development of a program of socio-cultural activities, exhibitions, etc.; processing and buying and selling companies; the 'Montes de Soria' association as an instrument of use, management and governance; development of mycotourism activities; synergies with the rural tourism and hospitality sector; development of second homes in the municipality. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Some Spanish mountain regions carry out mycological exploitation initiatives, with different degrees of importance and regulation. Such is the case in the mountains of León, the sierras of Salamanca and Zamora, as well as the Sierra de Cameros in La Rioja."
