Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 TR. Kozak type pine nuts are a very special and valuable type in terms of export. Turkey is very important country to producers and exporters of pine nuts (Pinus pinea L.)( Çetin, 2003; Öztürk and Küçükerdem, 2017) .The pick up activity of pine nuts is done by small family farmers using with special pole/stake while the processing is done by cooperatives and firms, with specific rules. The cooperative activities have an important impact on the regional SES. The perspectives of the product bring together the farmers, the local government, cooperatives and firms.

Peanut pine (Pinus pinea L.), a characteristic tree of Mediterranean climate, is commonly grown in Bergama-Kozak plateau in Turkey. The most efficient peanut pines in Turkey are located in the Kozak plateau (Madra Mountains). There are pine forests up to 740 meters high on granite soils in Bergama, Kozak. Farmers living in Bergama/Kozak pick up pine nutes/cones from october to april every year. The main livelihood of farmers is pine nuts agriculture in this region. The pine nuts agriculture is done in two ways. The first is to pick up in forests which are grown by Ministry of Forestry or local administration. The second is farmers plant in orchards as a culture. Pine nut is very special and very valuable. It is niche market and associated with mountain farming, especially in higher region.   30% of the pine nut areas of Turkey are located in Kozak/Bergama. Kozak type pine nuts are full body, large, light cream color, soft structure, pointed tip cream colored and blunt pine nut. The altitude, climatic characteristics, traditional process, give to these pine nuts a lot of character, that it has a Geographical Indication by Turkish Patent and Trademark Office.    In recent years, the yield of pine seedlings of Kozak plateau has decreased considerably. The most important problems are pests and diseases, lack of qualified personnel, education, , inadequate advertisement and marketing. For the processing, marketing and promotion of pine nuts product, the number of establishments such as cooperative should be increased. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Pine nuts are not included in other MRLs."
