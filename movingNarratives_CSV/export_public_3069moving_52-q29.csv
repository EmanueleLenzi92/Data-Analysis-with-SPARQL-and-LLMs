It is a successful case of creation, in 2009, of a short organic production and consumption channel based on a territorial radius that brings together nearly 500 consumer families, fifty producers and processors, and several dozen collective consumers. It s a successful best practice, implemented by a collective of private actors and consumers, with little public support. The process has innovated agricultural production practices and created a processing workshop, warehouse, and store, maintaining a vast network of collaborative relationships with other actors in the production and consumption of organic food within a radius of 150 km.   The production activity is located on orchards and other organic farms situated in Cabra and other towns in the Subbetica and south of Cordoba. Other organic productions from nearby areas and provinces. The physical space of reception, processing, distribution, and sale is in the municipality of Cabra.    The initiative is aligned with the promotion of agroecology principles, the commitment to short channels, and the aggregation of actors in a territorially based food hub. Ensuring scalability and resilience is its challenge. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. It is a social innovation that has progressively implemented innovative solutions in the production, processing, storage, distribution, marketing, and consumption phases. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This Value Chain scheme is flourishing in many areas of Europe but it is relatively rare when it is promoted from a rural area and even more so when it connects a mountain area to other lowland areas and nearby cities."
