Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 TR. The most common marketing channel used by greenhouse tomato growers is the wholesale markets brokers. The traders are used moderately in product sales. The direct to consumer sales are low. The greenhouse tomato growers sell to exporter companies less frequently. Although tomatoes produced in the region are of high quality, producers cannot get high prices for their products. This is one of the negative aspects of the value chain. Also, the greenhouse tomato growers in Elmalı do not have a farmer's organization. On the other hand, the fact that the tomato produced in Elmalı is a highland product creates a positive effect in terms of the product's value chain. As a matter of fact, tomatoes grown in the highland have a higher quality and healthier product image.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Bey mountains, Antalya. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Elmalı. Elmalı is a town and district in Antalya Province, the Mediterranean region of Turkey. It lies about 35 km (22 mil) inland, near the town of Korkuteli and 110 km (68 mil) west of the city of Antalya. In 2020, the population for the whole district was 39365. Elmalı is a small plateau at the head of a long upland valley in the Beydağları range of the western Taurus Mountains, surrounded by high peaks including the 2500m Elmalı Mountain. Aside from the town of Elmalı, the district includes two other small towns (Akçay and Yuva) as well as villages. The area is watered by streams running off the mountains. Although close to the Mediterranean, Elmalı is high in the mountains and has an inland climate of cold winters and hot summers, (although still much cooler than the coast). Near to Lake Avlan there is an area of cedar forest, rare in Turkey (Wikipedia,2021).   The size of the area (km2) is 1658. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1150. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2503. The total population (in thousand) is 39.365. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 23.74.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is High. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 14.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 68.40%.   Antalya is one of the regions with the highest annual total sunshine duration in Turkey (3,011 hours of sunshine per year) (https://www.gnssolar.com/icerik/860/turkiye-gunes-haritasi). In Antalya, the district with the highest annual total sunshine duration is Elmalı (https://gepa.enerji.gov.tr/MyCalculator/pages/7.aspx). In addition, the air is cool and dry because of high mountain region. Both the high annual sunshine duration and the favorable climatic conditions played an important role in the development of greenhouse cultivation in Elmalı. Especially greenhouse tomato cultivation is very common in the region. Due to the favorable conditions in the region, greenhouse tomato producers produce higher quality tomatoes compared to the producers located in the plain. Tomatoes produced in greenhouses in Elmalı have a better appeal than those grown in the plain. Greenhouse tomato cultivation is an innovative production activity for the Elmalı region. Disease and pest density is low in the region due to climatic and topographic factors. Therefore, less pesticides are used. Using less input increases the income of producers. In addition, greenhouse tomato growers in Elmalı produce higher quality tomatoes than the ones in the plain. Quality tomato production provides an opportunity for tomato growers to obtain high prices for their products. The price advantage in the product positively affects the producer income. As a result, greenhouse areas have increased rapidly in recent years in Elmalı as greenhouse cultivation activities provide high income. In addition, healthier products are supplied to the market due to the use of less pesticides.   Natural: The total area under greenhouse tomato cultivation in Elmalı is about 835 hectares. The average farm size per household is between 0.4 and 0.5 hectares. Social: Greenhouse tomato cultivation has been carried out in Elmalı since 2000. The number of greenhouse tomato growers is 1850. Approximately 95% of greenhouse tomato growers are smallholder farms. Community interaction has had an important effect on the spread of greenhouse tomato cultivation in Elmalı.    There are three major challenges for growers growing tomatoes in greenhouse. These are respectively; low crop selling prices, crop diseases and labor shortages. Greenhouse tomato production is very common in Antalya. There are many greenhouse tomato growers especially in the plain region of Antalya. The high supply of tomatoes causes the prices to fall. Although greenhouse tomato growers in Elmalı produce higher quality tomatoes compared to the producers in the plain, they cannot obtain high prices. Producers encounter crop diseases. However, crop diseases are less common than in lowland areas (plain). This is also an important advantage. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are This value chain includes greenhouse tomato cultivation. Tomatoes are grown under greenhouse production system. The local assets include Natural and Social.   This value chain, which includes greenhouse tomato cultivation, is not present in other MRLs in the Member States. This value chain is only available in Turkey. For this reason, it is a specific value chain that should be examined within the scope of the project."
