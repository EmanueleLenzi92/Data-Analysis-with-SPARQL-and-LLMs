Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 ES. A small revolution has taken place in the last half century with the consolidation of a dozen wineries in municipalities such as Cadiar, Torvizcon or Murtas. They are small companies that cultivate between 10 and 50 hectares and produce an average of 20,000 liters per year. The production is destined for the provincial and regional market as well as for the European and North American markets. The vineyards coexist with almond, fig and olive trees. Some of the wineries are part of the Granada Wine Route, a group of companies whose common objective is 'the active enjoyment of the world of wine in the province of Granada'. The area is under the PDO Granada with a subzone, Contraviesa Alpujarra, as well as the PGI Cumbres del Guadalfeo.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Cádiar. The Sierra de la Contraviesa is a mountainous formation flanked by the Sierra Nevada to the north, the Sierra de Lújar to the west and the Sierra de Gádor to the east, near the Mediterranean Sea. This area produces excellent wines thanks to the genuine nature of the grapes and its subsequent artisanal process. The vineyards are among the highest in Europe, which means that the ripening period is longer. The conditions are optimal to produce wines of extraordinary quality.   The size of the area (km2) is 47.28. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 850. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1400. The total population (in thousand) is 1.465. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 30.98. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -10.50%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 10146.71. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 15101.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 7.47%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 14.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 77.88%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 182. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,03%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 222. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 86.4. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 9.74%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.46%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 73.80%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   Wines produced from vineyards planted at the highest altitude (1400 meters) in Europe, in small productions and high identity value. The agro-ecological system is polyculture. Each farmhouse in the area maintains a small winery while a dozen professional firms offer their wines to the market. Vineyards have been renewed in recent decades, as well as the diversity of wine types and markets, the introduction of other cultural and tourist activities, along with widespread organic production and online sales.   The altitude, slate soils and very little rainfall give these wines a lot of character. Fifty years ago they began replanting vines of a local variety, the Vigirieja, which coexist with other varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. The aim is to maintain the multivarietal that affects the old vines to produce some special rosé. They produce white and red wines but also rosés, cavas and even sweet wines.    Lack of professionalism and high prices can reduce competitiveness and cause surpluses, aggravated by the health crisis. There is no articulated business association, in an environment that is not very conducive to associationism. Climate change is noticeable in the ripening cycles of the grapes. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The main innovation has to do with the changeover of most wineries to organic production and the introduction of complementary activities (tourism, tastings, etc.) that inject cash flow into the management of the companies. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Other mountain wines are produced in different areas of Spain (Sierra de Ronda, Tenerife Island, etc.) but also in different Greek, German or Italian regions, among others."
