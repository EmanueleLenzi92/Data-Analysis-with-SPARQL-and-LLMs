The company Melise is a result of a successful collaboration process among local actors and an external one that established a profitable local value chain on growing, processing and selling organic apples cultivated in abandoned lands. Here positive environmental (e.g., reduction of soil erosion), economic (like job opportunities) and social (e.i., chance to not emigrate) aspects are evident. Melise is also involved in other projects on honey production, 'agricultural' beer and rural tourism. New products are marketed (apples, also indigenous varieties, as fruit, jams, fruit juices, etc.) and a new production process is implemented (organic farming), and the territory, as a natural and socio-cultural context, is enhanced as a quality brand.   The abandoned lands and the socio-cultural context has been involved in a new value chain through a cooperation process that has extensively exploited an uncommon fruit production for the area.    The competition on the organic and local products market is high and the company aims to growth the commitment in food processing and for recover the traditional byotipes of apple trees. This requires new skills and business models. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Organic farming was a novelty in the local context and apple cultivation. The connection between local administration and farmers allowed for valorising natural and cultural local resources (in the agricultural, in future livestock initiatives as well as tourism sectors). In this case the VC(s) involves several local actors. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The value chain(s) activated by 'Melise' has been diversified and tended to continue to innovate (i.e., there is a project to recover traditional livestock productions). 'Melise' has developed into a broader social innovation process promoted by cooperation between public and private actors."
