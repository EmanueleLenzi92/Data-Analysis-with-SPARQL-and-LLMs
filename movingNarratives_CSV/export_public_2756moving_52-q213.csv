However, it is a typical VC that directly relies on ecosystem of the region and creates new synergies with tourism and spa industry, gastronomy and food production sector. Some mineral water sources are owned by large corporations (food industry), some of them are owned by local actors (municipalities). These configurations create different combinations of interests and affect the way how regional society and economy benefit from the natural asset.

Mineral water originating in mountain areas is directly linked with ecosystem of the location, it has been traditionally used for centuries, the VC is associated with tourism and spa industry, food production (sold outside the region).   Key asset is the undegroung water, marketing of the product and symbolic value of the region that enables to valorize the product.    Highly competetive market, high investment costs, quality of the product is based on endogennous factors that cannot be controled. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The VC is not very innovative, it is based on tradition that has started in 19th century, sources of mineral waters are associated with the region spa towns. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are mineral water production is associated with the underground sources of water. The local assets include Cultural.   This kind of VC is present on several mountain areas of the Czech Republic."
