Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is HUNGARY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 HU. Logging for firewood, sawmill and nearby thermal power plant. Replantation and maintenance of the forest. Typical and traditional mountain activity, complemented with building and maintaining tourist routes, resting places, watch towers, etc. Workers employed in forestry are often disadvantaged, poor people, not having other possibilities for income, thus forestry is important for social reasons. Well managed forest provides for biodiversity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Transdanubian mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zirc.

Logging for firewood, sawmill and nearby thermal power plant. Replantation and maintenance of the forest. Typical and traditional mountain activity, complemented with building and maintaining tourist routes, resting places, watch towers, etc. The use of modern machinery and the sale of wood to a nearby thermal power plant is innovative.   Forest management is a typical mountain activity and is also traditional locally, based entirely on traditional local knowledge. It uses the local forests and woods and infrastructure.    Climate change (warming, new pests, extreme weather conditions, draught, frost damages). Managing forest workers (often poor, excluded social groups.) Theft of wood, illegal activities. Wildl animals can also cause significant damage to new installations. Conflicts with forest users, littering, visitor pressure (hikers, motorcyclists, cyclists, mushroom pickers). Vandalism, damaging forest furniture, resting places, etc. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Forest management is a typical mountain activity and is also traditional locally, based entirely on traditional local knowledge. The use of modern machinery and the sale of wood to a nearby thermal power plant is innovative. Developing watch towers, tourist pathes in recent years is a 'traditional innovation' in this field. The innovation is related to The use of modern machinery and the sale of wood to a nearby thermal power plant is innovative. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
