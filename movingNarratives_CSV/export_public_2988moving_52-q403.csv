Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 SER. There are around 100 beekeepers gathered in three beekeeper associations that coordinate and support by advice and quality certification of the production. The sale is moslty direct, by producers themselves, though a portion is labeled and sold trhough Serbian Beekeper Association SPOS. The beekeepers from three municipalities are incuded in production of Vlasina honey, but for most of them these are hobby activities, that supplement their family budget. Total yearly production of Vlasina honey is estimated at 15-20 tons which is a third of all honey produced in this area.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia, Balkan mountains region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Balkan mountains. Currently the region is very much visited by locals and nature lovers, the population density is small and declining. There are news on the alarming projects that intend to convert the area in more intensive touristic destination. Honey production is one of the activities that could strenghten the relation to natural capital and also benefit from it.   The size of the area (km2) is 628. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 475. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1875. The total population (in thousand) is 18.50. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 29.00. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -8.56%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 30. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -7.15%.

Vlasina honey is recently registered as a PDO and one of the five honeys in Serbia with this statys. The area where it is produced, Vlasina plateau and Vlasina lake are very known by its specific eco-systems, floating peat-islands and preserved nature. Beekeepers in the area mainly deal with stationed beekeeping in beekeeping directly at this area. They produce high quality multifloral honey which is highly valued and associated with floral and landscape uniqueness. Though protected, it is at the same time in constant threat of the untransparent investments that might have negative impact on the local resources. Strong depopulation of the area and lack of economic opportunities brings also unrealistic expectations of this developments for local people mostly searcing for employment and income. Vlasina honey and the territory from which it comes from, are example of insufficiently valorised unique areas of moutnains and mountain ecosystems. The contrasts of high natural value and tendencies of misuse in construction of small hidropower plants and water management (currently) and investments in large toursm capacities, raise alertion to look and promote more sustainable ways of gaining economic benefits.   Vlasina plateau and Vlasina lake are protected as a landscape of outstanding features and categorized as a natural resource of great importance. Its signiture is diversity and specificity of biotopes causing a high diversity of flora, vegetation, fauna and ecosystems that are characterized by high degree of origins and authenticity of natural features. One of the lake's most famous features are the floating islands. It is estimated that the peat chunks took 5,000 years to form. There are up to 30 floating islands at the time. Driven by the wind, they float from one shore of the lake to another, carrying the flora and fauna, and serving as shelter and a food source for fish. For that reason, they are an attractive target for fishermen, however it is forbidden to visit them or disturb them because of the unique animal and plant ecosystems, though walking on them is practically impossible since they don't have solid ground.    Vlasina area is under pressures of misuse from many aspect. This part of Serbia has one of the largest migration rates, adn strong disbalance in regional development, comparing to the most developed areas. The natural values are reason for also very strong and not enough transparent plans for conversion of the area in tourisam center. In the meantime there are issues that affect the local ecosystms and activities leaning on them. Artificial by origin, this lake and the watershed face issues of water use and water management.In 2018 . sudden water discharge at the dam threatened to destroy the part of the plan and animal life in the lake. Numerous boats and barges were stranded, so as the 'Moby-Dick', the largest floating island on the lake. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Quality governance, certification and new packaging and labeling are part of the new strategies to communicate the quality of this product. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
