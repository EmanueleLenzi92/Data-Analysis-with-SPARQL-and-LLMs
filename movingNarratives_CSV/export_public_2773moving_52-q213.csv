Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 CZ. Producers are not necessarily located in the mountains. However this business is mostly associated with livestock farms that strive for diversification and valorization of their production. The most succesful meat producers find their customers in nearby towns and large cities. The typical marketing chanels inlclude farm shops, farmers markets and on-farm sales. The VCs is linked with other VCs described previously, since the meat products can use different types of meat (beef, goat, sheep). Combination of these assets create powerful synergies that enable to valorize local resources and contribute to local production and consumption of food with many positive impacts.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Klatovy. Moountainm Reference Landscape is very diverse. The area of the region (LAU 1 Klatovy) is covered by 46 % by agricultural land. About 55 % of the agricultural land is arable. Lower areas of the region (LAU 1) are suitable for relatively intense production of crops (including wheat and rape seeds). Upper areas are suitable for potato production. The south-western borders of the region neigbor the Germany. This is the area of the Sumava mountains. Due to the large share of the areas with high altitude there are many areas covered with forests. About 43 % of the region's areas are covered with forests.   The size of the area (km2) is 1946. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 250. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1370. The total population (in thousand) is 86.405. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 44. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -2.60%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 69.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 10193. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9675.69. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9836.73. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 19458.96. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 43.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 52.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 30828. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.33%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3183. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 85. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 41.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 56.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Meat production represensts a specific part of the food production sector. The VCs valorizes natural and symbolic values associated with the mountain region. The VC is a classic example of the alternative food network. Most of the meat production is carried out on farms that specialize in animal husbandry. Processing their farm products enables farms to gain higher added value from their farming activities. Meat products from such VCs are currently highly attractive even for mainstream consumers. Producerts are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products and try to valorize symbolic features of the mountain region (such as 'pure nature', 'traditions' etc.).   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The producers of the meat products use these images in names of their producst and description. In this way they valorize symbolic resources of the given mountain region.    Main challenges are associated with (1) marketing of the products and (2) hygienic rules that require very high investment costs. Most of the succesful meat producers rely on quality meat inputs from their own farms. The challenges of this VCs are thus similar to the challenges related to VCs that consists of the cattle husbandry. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Innovation is associated with development of new food producst that emphasize food quality in symbolic (process-based) and substantial (product-based) meaning. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Cultural."
