Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 CZ. Producers are not necessarily located in the mountains. Their businesses can be located outside mountains. However, they purchase and collect products from the mountain region (fruit). The products are processed and valorized. Since the producers operate on niche market they often use alternative marketing channels (eshops, farmers markets, farmers shops). Their impact on the regional SES is positive. They use - and strengthen - symbolic value associated with the mountain region. This strategy bring many direct and undirect impacts, e.g. for tourism.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Klatovy. Moountainm Reference Landscape is very diverse. The area of the region (LAU 1 Klatovy) is covered by 46 % by agricultural land. About 55 % of the agricultural land is arable. Lower areas of the region (LAU 1) are suitable for relatively intense production of crops (including wheat and rape seeds). Upper areas are suitable for potato production. The south-western borders of the region neigbor the Germany. This is the area of the Sumava mountains. Due to the large share of the areas with high altitude there are many areas covered with forests. About 43 % of the region's areas are covered with forests.   The size of the area (km2) is 1946. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 250. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1370. The total population (in thousand) is 86.405. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 44. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -2.60%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 69.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 10193. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9675.69. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9836.73. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 19458.96. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.00%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 30828. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.33%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3183. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 85. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 41.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 56.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Marmelade production represents a specific part of the food production sector. This sector is a typical representative of the alternative food network(s). The production of marmelade is important for valorization of resources in mountain areas because it (1) utilizes less common sources (fruit produced on farms as well as wild berries growing in mountain areas) and (2) put in fore symbolic value of mountain areas that are constructed as 'natural' and 'pure' regions, (3) contributes to regional economy based on small-scale enterprenourship and innovate forms of marketing in food areas. Producerts are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products and try to valorize symbolic features of the mountain region (such as 'pure nature', 'traditions' etc.).   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The producers of the marmelade use these images in names of their producst and description. In this way they valorize symbolic resources of the given mountain region.    Main challenge for the viabitliy of this VC is economic pressure that comes from the competetive setting. Production of the high-quality marmelade competes with mainstream products that provide low-cost solution for consumers. The VC relies on the 'turn-to-quality' and focus on developing a niche market. Most marmelade producers are not fruit growers. They buy it from farms or from traders. Another challenge is the capacity to attract consumers with the use of the alternative marketing chanells which direcly impacts on profitability of their businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is associated with development of new food producst that emphasize food quality in symbolic (process-based) and substantial (product-based) meaning. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Social and cultural.   It is likely that the VCs spans over the country borders. Similar examples can be thus found in Germany and Austria."
