Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 CH2. The VC is composed of several actors such as public and private forest owners, their forestry departments and other processing and sales companies. There is therefore often a mix of public and private actors. There is a Swiss wood label, which indicates that the wood comes from Swiss forests and has been processed in Swiss companies by highly qualified professionals.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura.

The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 279.80. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 364. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1650. The total population (in thousand) is 396.43. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 141.68. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.58%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 27726.44. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.99%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 29.59%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.42%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 27890.65. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 5665. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 6.08%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3051. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 38. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.21%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 33.88%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 61.79%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   The forest covers a very large part of the Jura mountain (together with the pastures) and therefore represents a large prevalence of landuse systems. The forest area should not be reduced in favour of built-up or agricultural area, as it is extremely protected in Switzerland. The sustainable development of the forest is therefore extremely important for the development of the Swiss Jura mountains.   Forests are a local asset and depend strongly on natural conditions (change in rainfall, temperature, soils, slope, etc.). In Switzerland, forests are managed by legal bases guaranteeing sustainable exploitation in the framework of forestry planning.    Wood production is threatened by natural hazards such as drought increased by climate change (in addition to the shallow, calcareous soil), as well as the bark beetle. A major transformation in the composition of forests is expected. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and Political norms.   Timber exploitation is offered to the whole of Switzerland. In our case the MLR stops at the canton of Jura, but in reality, the chain is wider, with different forest compositions."
