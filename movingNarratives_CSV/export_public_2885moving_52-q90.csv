Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GERMANY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 DE. The planted vineyard area is around 89 ha and is cultivated by 44 wineries - so the structures are quite small. Like the Moselle in general, Winningen is known for white wine (about 90% of the vineyard area) and especially for Riesling. Unlike other sections of the growing region, many more dry wines are produced here. This is thanks to the village's most famous winegrower Heymann-Löwenstein, who has been producing mainly dry wines since the early 1980s and was thus one of the pioneers on the Moselle. In 2005, one of his wines was named best foreign wine in Paris. He also worked to ensure that the 'Uhlen' vineyard was the first one in Germany to receive three small appellations contrôlées within only one vineyard.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Rhenish Massif. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Winningen. Winningen is located on the Lower Moselle only about 10 km from Koblenz, where the Moselle flows into the Rhine. Many years ago, terraces were built by hand in order to cultivate vines on the extremely steep slopes. The terroir is characterised by Devonian slate of various formations and is mainly known as the home of powerful Riesling wines, which in the 19th century were as expensive as the top crus from Bordeaux and Burgundy.   The size of the area (km2) is 6.65. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 75. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 210. The total population (in thousand) is 2.421. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 364. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.80%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 185.61. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.50%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 34600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6043.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.76%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 36.27%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 62.96%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 34600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 45321.94. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.88%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 31.73%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 67.38%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 254. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 706. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 10.2. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.24%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 71.95%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 1.40%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.28%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 72.33%.   Wines from extremely steep, terraced vineyards (70% slope) with low yields and high quality. The vineyards are characterised by many small plots with their own microclimates and different slate formations (red, blue and grey slate) and are habitats for rare animals such as the Apollo butterfly. Due to climate change, the comparatively warm slopes are heating up. The careful work of the winegrowers enhances the reputation of the wines and ensures a clear and unique style. They are distinguished from the rest of the Moselle wines by their mix of opulence and delicacy.   Winningen is located in a nature reserve. This winegrowing municipality has won several awards, making it one of the most beautiful villages in Germany. It is famous for the 'Moselfest', the oldest wine festival in Germany.    The vineyards cannot be mechanised. For many wines produced there, apart from a few well-known wineries, no adequate prices are achieved in relation to the production effort. Organic viticulture is therefore not or hardly possible. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. For some years now, the municipality has been receiving more attention through the activities of the young generation of winemakers. In 2020, a young winemaker from Winningen was named Rising Star of the Year by Germany's most important wine guide. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Vineyard area. The local assets include Natural and Cultural.   Comparable terraced vineyards can be found in particular on the Moselle and its tributaries the Saar and Ruwer. The most famous example is certainly the 'Calmont' in the village of Bremm, which is the steepest vineyard in Europe. In addition, terraces have also been created in other mountainous regions such as Baden, Rheingau and the Middle Rhine."
