Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 RO. Specialist trading companies such as 'Seradria' have a network of partners managing collection points in the main sheep producing regions in Romania. 'Seradria' has annual capacity to expert up to 150,000 live animals per year (including cattle and bulls for breeding). Collection points include 'Agratransilvania' in the commune of Caţa in Braşov county (https://agratransilvania.ro). There is a clear distinction between the value chains for sheep and those for lambs. Most sheep are exported to the Middle East (Libya and Jordan) with a particular focus upon the Islamic ritual called Eid al-Adha (the 'Festival of the Sacrifice'). Exports of live lambs are targetted more at EU countries - notably Greece and Italy. For more information see here: https://seradria.com/blog/romania-europes-largest-live-sheep-exporter-who-buys-most-of-our-sheep.html Exports are authorised by the Romanian sanitary veterinary authorities who aim to ensure that: All livestock accomodation is in accordance with EU welfare standards; Sanitary and veterinary certificates are available, and; Effective traceability systems are in place.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Caţa commune in Braşov County (RO122). Braşov county is a hilly mountainous region (500 - 2000 metres altitude) located in the south-eastern part of Transylvania. The relief is a diverse mix of mountainous (35%), hilly (50%) and lower altitude plain areas (15%) with an associated land use of forests (mainly in the mountain areas), permanent grasslands (mainly in the hilly areas), cultivated arable fields (in the hilly areas and lower altitude plains and hill areas) plus some urban, industrial and water surfaces (lakes and reservoirs).

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 42.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 48.00%.   Romania is Europe's largest exporter of live sheep and lambs for slaughter with an estimated market value of 175 million EUR / year. This is an important value chain for sheep farmers in the Carpathians, especially for supporting the finacial viability of many small farms and thereby ensuring their continued existence and contribution to the maintenance of the traditional farming practices that are important for biodiversity conservation and the valued mountain landscapes.   The live sheep and lambs collected from local farms for export are usually from the most two common breeds found in the Carpathians - the Tsurcana breed (a traditional indigenous breed that was favoured by Romanian transhumance shepherds and is still very popular in mountain villages) and the Tsigai breed (a more recently introduced breed that is more common in the hilly sub-mountainous areas of the Carpathians).    The live export of sheep and lambs is highly controversial because of the animal welfare issues associated with transporting live animals over long distances. This tragically was brought to the attention of the global media in November 2019 when a cargo ship carrying almost 15,000 sheep capsized in the Black Sea shortly after leaving Romania for Saudi Arabia - for more details see here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/europe/romanian-sheep-cargo-ship.html. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Live sheep and lambs collected from local farms."
