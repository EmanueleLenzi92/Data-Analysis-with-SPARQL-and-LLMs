Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 BG. The 9 founding members of the association currently offer their customers a very broad range of products: sheep cheese and yogurt, lamb and sheep meat; cows milk hard cheese, several types of kashkaval, cream, butter and yoghurt; goats' milk pressed cheese and white ('Sirene') cheese; honey; jams and marmalades from forest fruits, and; distinctive regional wines. This is a very diverse offer that encourages their customers to return regularly to buy the association's products from the farmers' markets they participate in. The normal arrangement is for one or two members of the association to travel (in turn) to the market location and sell the products of all their colleagues. This makes much more efficient use of their time.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Berkovitsa Municipality in Montana Province (BG312). The relief of the Montana province (MON36) varies greatly. The majority (65%) of the province is a fertile plain area in the north bordering the Danube River. This area is dominated by intensive arable cropping. In contrast, there are four mountainous municipalities in the south-west of the province that encompass much of the Western Planina Stara mountain range (with highest peak of 2,016 metres). Most grasslands and livestock are found in this region, together with forest land on the steeper slopes.   The size of the area (km2) is 465. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 16.343.

Group of 9 farmers from 4 muncipalities - Chiprovtsi (MON36), Georgi Damyanovo (MON14), Berkovitsa (MON02) and Varshets (MON12) - in Montana Province (BG312) created an association in 2016 to jointly market their products under a common brand: 'Food from the Mountain'. The innovation is currently focused upon the implementation of the association's strategy for the joint marketing of members' products.   The natural assets used are the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) of the region. Many of these are publically-owned and were historically used as common grasslands under the control of the local municipality. After Bulgaria joined the EU and CAP Pillar I support payments were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The association is also making use of some of the small plots of cultivated land that exist locally.    The main problem of people living and working in this mountain region is diversifying their business activities in order to add value and receive a fair payment for their high quality products and adequate compensation for their hard work. The association is intended as an entity which will both: i) help producers to produce better quality, innovative products and selling them at a competitive price, and ii) facilitate further innovation in diversifying the sources of income of the members e.g. developing a tourist product such as a 'Western Stara Planina Food and Wine Trail'. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Members of the association participate together in a weekly farmers market in Sofia, plus national fairs and events. Longer term they aim to develop their region as an alternative tourism destination offering clean food, traditional products, food and wine tasting. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
