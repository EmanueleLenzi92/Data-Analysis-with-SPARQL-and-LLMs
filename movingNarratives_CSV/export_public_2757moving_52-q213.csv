Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 CZ. Farms - cattle breeding, cattle husbandry, grazing, perennial grassland management. Farms implement organic farming methods. Many farms process beef and sells either through shops or directly (on farm sale, eshops, farmers markets). Beef products from farms are organic certified. Some farms also use the quality schemes associated with the label that refer to 'region' or 'Czech' origin.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Klatovy. Moountainm Reference Landscape is very diverse. The area of the region (LAU 1 Klatovy) is covered by 46 % by agricultural land. About 55 % of the agricultural land is arable. Lower areas of the region (LAU 1) are suitable for relatively intense production of crops (including wheat and rape seeds). Upper areas are suitable for potato production. The south-western borders of the region neigbor the Germany. This is the area of the Sumava mountains. Due to the large share of the areas with high altitude there are many areas covered with forests. About 43 % of the region's areas are covered with forests.   The size of the area (km2) is 1946. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 250. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1370. The total population (in thousand) is 86.405. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 44. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -2.60%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 69.7. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.02%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18240. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 10718.2. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 17515.15. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 21555.5. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 43.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 52.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 30828. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.33%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 3183. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 85. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 41.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 56.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Cattle husbandry on perennial grassland is a part of a typical image associated with agriculture in Sumava mountains. The farms are currently aiming on excellent breeding programs and high quality meat production, farms implement organic methods that often take place in nature-protected areas and also in National Park, this requires farmers to find a good balance between farming technologies and environmental constrains, such setting has become a driver for innovations in provison of ecosystem services and special grazing managements. Farms are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products.   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season.    Farms rely on complex subsidy schemes that significantly affect their economic performance, significant changes in the system will impact on their economy, the farms are aiming on high-quality meat production and operate on a very competetive food market, one of the key challanges is associated with marketing, i.e. attract customers and create demand for their products. Another challenge is associated with glopbal climate change. The large cattle farms heavily rely on sufficent amount of grass. Recent years showed that in certain periods of dry Summer (e.g in year 2018) there might be a shortage of the feedstuff for animals. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is associated with development of specific grazing managements, meat procession and marketing. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land and grazing meadows and management of perennial grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   It is likely that the VCs spans over the country borders. Similar examples can be thus found in Germany and Austria."
