Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 ES. There are 6 main different kind of cheeses in the area, shared by three provinces (NUTS2). The blue cheeses from this region stand out nationwide and even competing in international cheese awards. The quality is certified by the four PDOs and two PGIs. As mentioned above, this cheese is highly linked to the social-ecological-system, being produced by the milk of the animals that graze in common mountain pastures, maintaining this simbolic element of the regional landscape. In addition, the caves have been used for many generations to cure and keep the cheese, giving them a special flavour.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Picos de Europa. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Cabrales. The MRL is fully integrated in Picos de Europa. It has a high mountain geography with multiple peaks above the 2000 meters. Many of its land is bare rock and more than 70% of its surface has slope above 35%. However, there are also areas of mild relief mountain pastures where the cattles are grazed. The climate is template and humid (average temperature/year 12 C and 1700mm of precipitation).   The size of the area (km2) is 238.3. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 130. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2650. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 8.15. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -13.85%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 14776. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 21555. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.41%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 27.11%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.47%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified.

The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 102. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 19.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 76.10%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   With four PDOs and two PGIs, this is the region with highest density of quality certifications in cheesemaking in Europe. The cattle graze in common mountain pastures within the Ntional Park and the surroundings. The cheeses are part of the cultural heritage of the region and an important touristic asset. E-commerce and the labelling are both part of new marketing strategies.   1) Abandonment of traditional practices (shepherds and artisan cheesemakers) with lack of generational replacement: 2) Low production and scarce marketing strategies. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovations are related to e-commerce strategies (still not very developed) and the geographical certifications. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Animal skin / leather. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   This VC is present in the following municipalities: Cabrales (33008), Peñamellera Alta (33046), Cangas de Onís (22012), Onís (33043), Amieva (33003), Ponga (33050), Cabezón de Liébana (39013), Camaleño (39015), Cillórigo de Liébana (39022), Peñarrubia (39049), Pesaguero (39050), Potes (39055), Tresviso (39088), Vega de Liébana (39096), Posada de Valdeón (24116), Oseja de Sajambre (24106)."
