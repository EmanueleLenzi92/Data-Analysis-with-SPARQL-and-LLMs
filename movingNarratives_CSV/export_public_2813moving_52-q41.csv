Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 GR. The Selli area carob cultivation has become the origin of an extensive VC developed in Rethymno prefecture, which involves local farmers and family firms producing a multitude of local procucts (bread, baked goods, pasta, cocoa, syrup used as natural sweetener, cosmetics, alternative sweeteners and animal feed), ornamental use and timber, and firms for standardization, packaging, promotion and marketing. The carob poroducts, part of the local gastronomy, are present in hosting activities and in tourism in general. The reference mountain chain of this VC is VRISSINAS. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is SELLI RETHYMNO. Despite its small size, Vrissinas represents, in a miniature form, the typical image of many mountain landscapes of Crete: Steep slopes, mainly covered with shrubby vegetation and kermes oaks and numerous springs, especially in the central mountainous volume, indicated by the aquatic vegetation (ferns). A Minoan Peak sanctuary is located at its arid peak, making it a favourable destination for walking excursions. In the small valley of Selli the carob trees thrive. The area is 20km from Rethymno. The size of the area (km2) is 396.3. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 773. The total population (in thousand) is 87.691. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 58.80. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.02%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13800. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1046.08.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 70.79%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.97%. Carob is a characteristic plant of the arid Cretan landscape, adaptable to the drier Mediterranean climate. In the area of Selli, in a semi mountainous landscape (500m), more than 3000 carob trees, self- and man-planted, are organically cutivated/exploited by local farmers. One family-based company collects the production of the area. A small part is processed by that company to carob syrup, while the largest part is forwarded to other local companies that produce a variety of products and by-products for the Greek and international market. Carob is of multi-use, produces high reputation products, exibits high prevelance and a traditional connection to land use. The cultivation/expoitation of carobs is a complementary activity for many farmers, especially in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Because of the limited cultivation needs and the constantl demand, offers a complementary revenue and an alternative to more intensive and labor-demanding farming activities. The carob production as well as the processing for producing products like flour or syrop, can be done in a family or community level. Such activities have been proven sustainable and result to the strengthening of the social network and the resilience of the mountain populations. Αdaptable to the drier Mediterranean climate, the carob tree can form the basis of an agroforestry system. The carob contributes to recover eroded soil, survives to heavy droughts and wildfires, improves soil's fertility by fixing nitrogen and fixes 3 times more CO2 than other woody crops with 2.5 times less water. The traditional character of carob cutivation envolves local farmers and firms and strengthens their bonds. The carob is also a traditional ingredient of the cretan gastronomy, which had drawn attention due to new innovative editable products. Although carob is resilient to aridity, the climate change and the severe climate events of the last years can impact the quality and availability of carob pods. There is a growing interest in the national and international market for carob products and by-products, but this interest comes along with an intensive market competition from other Mediterranean countries. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The carob is a native tree in Crete, self-planted in many cases. The cultivation/exploitation is a traditional activity. The innovations are of two-fold: 
a. the organic cultivation and the integrated management of the production, 
b. a variety of products and by-products based on carob (e.g. carob powder is used as a coffee substitude as well as flour). 
The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. The VC is present all over Crete (EL43), though the most actors are spotted in Rethymno (EL433). Carob trees also grow wild or are cultivated in southern Spain and around the Mediterranean in Portugal, Italy and Turkey."
