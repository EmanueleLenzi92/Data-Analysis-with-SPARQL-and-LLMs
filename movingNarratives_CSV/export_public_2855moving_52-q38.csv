This farm produces potatos in the Sardinian mountains.In the recent years, the owners have start to process potatos using an innovative recipe to produce cookies called ' cioccoterra'. The farm took the opportunity offered by Reg.(UE) n.1151/2012 and Reg.(UE) n.665/2014 to use the label ' Mountain Product'. Innovation starts to spread also in this very traditional mountain value chain. A new product ( the cookie) is used to increase value of the traditional potatos. It is a smart way to use the Sardinian tradition ( granit stone, language, history) to promote for potato production. The recipes ( https://www.mpsardinia.it/ricette/) found on the web site are very innovative presenting potatoes as a fresh ingredient, easy and practical to prepare and healthy.   'Coltiviamo nel granito' we grow in granite, is how MP Sardinia describe their production. This short sentence describes the key local asset of the farm.    In Sardinia the used agricultural area for potato production is about 3000 ha ( source' Piano di settore pataticolo MIPAAF'), which represents only 4% of national surface. however, potato from Sardinia has a relevant quality and it is specialised in early potatos that are sold on market before other potatos varieties. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as N/A.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The idea to use potatos for cookies production came from Mp Sardinia (https://www.mpsardinia.it/), a Sardinian agricultural company located in Buddusò, and managed by the Pischedda brothers. The cookie is called 'Cioccoderra', a chocolate praline with a dark shell filled with potato cream. Two varieties of potatoes are used to make this delicacy: the purple potato, and the traditional yellow one. The floury dough of the first variety, and the slightly compact dough of the second one make these potatoes particularly suitable for pastry making. In order to be able to eliminate the water content and keep their density, it is combined with the delight of cocoa, butter and sugar, without using any preservatives. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are N/A. The local assets include N/A."
