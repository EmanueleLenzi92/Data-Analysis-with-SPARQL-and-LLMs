Pirot carpet is a living tradition of this area, 'a part of DNA of local people', it contains both the mystical and natural properties invoven in the motives. The patterns that give Pirot carpets a mystical allure, represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet. There are 95 varieties which weavers have to memorize. The raw material is locally produced wool of particular quality from the sheep raised on the local pastures and in Nature park Stara planina Mt. It is one of the most famous traditional handrafts. Very labour and skill intensive, it takes full month of whole day work to weave 80cm of the carpet, therefore it takes months for a single weaver to make one item.   The weaving skills are passed from generation to generation, and mostly to the women. Girls used to learn this skill from older sisters, or mother and grandmother when they turn 7. The wool used for weaving comes from the local sheep from the villages surrounding the town of Pirot, and from the nearby Stara Planina Nature Reserve. Sach shape has a specific meaning deriving from tradition and socio cultural linkages. Some kilims symbolize good health, well being, good fortune in love, business and success and a unique combintion sends a strong magical protection.    Carpets or kilim made in Pirot represent a unique piece of traditional decoration. The tradition of handweaving is more than 500 years old in Pirot and surrounding villages. Currently, in Pirot there are only 30 women who are still actively weaving. Considering that this number was around 2.500 during the last century, it s a bit saddening that the cool and unique tradition like this is slowly disappearing. There is no public program that supports knowledge transfer and training for the weavers, and most women find other employment easier and more profitable.
