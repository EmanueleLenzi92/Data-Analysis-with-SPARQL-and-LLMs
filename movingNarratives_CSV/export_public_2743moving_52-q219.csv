Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms, and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff, poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines, low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition, lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment, and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Stara Planina (Balkan Mountains). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Godech Municipality in Sofia Province (BG412). Sofia Province (BG412) is the second-largest province in Bulgaria with 22 municipalities. The overall relief of the province is highly diverse and it has an altitude range from 350 - 2,925 metres. Within its territory, the province encompasses parts of three mountain ranges: the Western Stara Planina in the north, Sredna Gora in the east and Rila mountains in the south-west. It also fully encompasses the individual Plana and Vitosha mountains. All mountains are separated by fertile valleys. The local economy is heavily industrialised with a long history of mining and manufacturing. Tourism is also very important, whilst agriculture is a relatively minor sector of the economy. The Godech municipality (SFO09) in the north of the province and is one of the 5 municipalities covered by the Western Stara Planina mountains.   The size of the area (km2) is 374.7. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 4.722. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 12.60. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 103.70. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8000. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1598. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.60%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 40.00%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 12900. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 23579. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 16.10%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 82.60%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 5959. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 16.10%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 22710. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 35.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 44.10%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 6.40%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.10%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 72.50%.   'Mogila' dairy is located in Godech Municipality (SFO09) in Sofia Province (BG412) and is one of 4 commercial dairies collecting liquid milk from dairy farmers in the 5 municipalities covered by the Western Stara Planina mountains.   The natural assets used are the semi-natural and natural mountain grasslands (meadows and pastures) of the region. Many of these are publically-owned and were historically used as common grasslands under the control of the local municipality. After Bulgaria joined the EU and CAP Pillar I support payments were introduced, the pattern of use of these natural assets has changed. When allocating use of the common grasslands to local farmers, municipalities now frequently give priority access to the best grasslands to those livestock farmers eligible to receive CAP payments and who can therefore pay a higher rent. The pastures in worse conditions in terms of scrub / tree encroachment are designated for common use by subsistence farmers in the villages that do not apply for CAP payments.    A key challenge for the dairy is achieving and maintaining a consistent supply of clean high quality milk that meets the requirements of all EU and national legislation. Whilst the dairy has invested in its own premises, equipment and staff in Godech, the problem remains the variable quality of the raw milk collected from farms which is affected by four main factors: 1) health status of the animals; 2) quality of milking machines; 3) maintenance of good hygiene in the cattle sheds, especially during milking, and; 4) storage conditions at the collection points where individual farmers take their fresh milk to be picked-up by the dairy. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
