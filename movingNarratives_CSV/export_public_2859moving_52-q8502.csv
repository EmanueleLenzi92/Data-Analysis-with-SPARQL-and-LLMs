This livestock farm, with its dairy, produces high-quality milk and cheese following strictly quality production standards and animal well-being principles. Some certifications attest to the link between the farm and the local context. For example, the QM certification ( Qualità Marche ) warrants the regional origin of milk, the Prodotto di montagna and Monti Sibillini labels certified the link between the territorial context and their productions. Because the farm is located in the national natural park of Sibillini, the breeding management has to follow environmental quality standards. The farmer introduces a cattle breed that is not typical of the area, and he also produces cheeses that are not specific to the Sibillini mountains (such as mozzarella cheese). The farmer does not seem to emphasise the connection with the territory, the innovations adopted, or the animal welfare's attention and his participation to a innovation research project funded by the EU. Also, he does not adopt innovative marketing strategies.   The Sibillini area belongs to the local culture as a place of traditions of the mountain and agricultural economy of the Marche region. The site is mentioned by the well-known romantic poet Giacomo Leopardi (who calls them the 'blue mountains'). Livestock production is typical of the area, as the share-cropping farm management (the 'mezzadria'). These SES elements are involved in the VC of the farm 'Angolo di Paradiso'.    VC needs to focus on the quality and quantity of local production to compete in the high-quality and traditional cheese market. In this sense, the company participates in a European project to improve the production of dairy cows (called I-Milka 2 ). It is also necessary to guarantee good job skills and employment, especially after the 2016 earthquake in central Italy. For this reason, the company participates in funding promoted by the committee Comitato Sisma del Centro Italia for vocational training. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The livestock farm owner is of non-regional origin (Sicily), and he has dairy and livestock breeding skills acquired from traditional family background and school and vocational training. He introduces the 'red spotted' breed in a context characterised by meat breeds (e.g., Marche cattle breed). Products are sold both on the farm and at specific sales points, like little supermarkets, in the area. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural."
