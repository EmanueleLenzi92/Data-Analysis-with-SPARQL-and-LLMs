They produce meat (lamb is the main product), milk and milk products (cheese, yogurt, cream) of different varieties and cosmetics. The wool is also used for textiles. They have different marketing relations (direct marketing, online shop, supermarket, ). The Weizer mountain lamb is classified as traditional food in Austria. The sheep plays a crucial role for the maintenance of small structured extensive farming in this region. In 1994 the cooperative was founded in order to provide a better base of the processing and marketing of the farmers products. The brand Määh is of importance for the joint marketing. Products are available via direct selling but also in the supermarket chain SPAR and in local restaurants and high class gastronomy. The lamb is the flagship product of the Weizer Schafbauern.   Sheep farming has a tradition since the middle age especially in areas where cattle cannot graze. In cooperation with ALMO farmers, free range pig farmers and a local butcher the Weizer Schafbauern have bought the old regional slaughter house, which was then rebuild in line with the EC regulation for organic certification. In important asset is the cultural landscape of the region, which is important for hiking tourism.    Farmers in the mountain region struggle to have sufficient income. The cooperative aims to secure income and to share certain production resources and to have a joint marketing. Additionally the region has heavy rain events which is supposed to increase in the course of climate change. Sheep farming, additionally, has been a method to increase biodiversity and to counteract forestation of mountain pastures. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted.
