Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 GR. The VC engages local producers and their families, in sustainable vertical practices of grapes cultivation, collection, wine/juice extraction and the fermentation and distillation processes for the production of spirit products. Most often the producers are also land owners with land titles passed from generation to generation and strong ties with the community. Most producers provide their products in bulk to the nearest market retailers, while a few businesses, as for example 'Korsa Drinks' produce bottled labelled products like the product series named 'BaiRaki'. The reference mountain chain of this VC is Psiloritis mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is HAGIA VARVARA. The location is situated at the north-easter foothills of the highest peak on the island, the Idi mountain range. The highest peak of the mountain is 2,456m and the surrounding area is characterized by high altitude rocky fields, with various small valleys of fertile soil. The highest altitudes levels close to the mountain range peak are rocky, arid and without plantation or trees. The foothills of the mountain range have a mixture of rocky and fertile landscape. The size of the area (km2) is 465.2. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1572. The total population (in thousand) is 315.162. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 119.40. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.02%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.01%. The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13800. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 3752.14. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.39%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.64%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 82.97%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 14300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 7862.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.91%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 78642. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.419%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 41162. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 30. In this region protected areas are present. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 15.23%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.38%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 72.39%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.97%. The spirit drink of tsikoudia has a centuries old tradition of production in the area, using a local distillation process on grapes pomance, the residue of grapes after being pressed for wine production. A similar product oberved in the Eastern Mediterranean region is called raki, but tsikoudia follows some particular techniques and grape varieties that are typical of this region and associated with its cultural identity. The grapes are produced in high altitude lansdcape and the pressing and distillation processes take place in local communities. Lately we observe the introduction of innovative products, mainly spirit drinks combining the traditional tsikoudia product with locally produced honey or fruit aromas.The VC is characterized by low-volume, high-quality products that grow fast in brand reputation, supporting the local community in the area of Hagia Varvara, at the foothills of Psiloritis mountain. As part of the cultural heritage and the gastronomy of the area, this VC has gained great reputation all over Greece and even abroad, extenting the reach of the VC. It is also inextricably linked to the communities' SES. The soil characteristics, lanscape, microclimate and high altitude mountainous area is ideal for the growth and quality production of the local gape varieties. The final products are characterized by high quality and distinct attributes and cultural identity. A local tsikoudia festival is organized in mid-summer. The most important challenge for this VC is to gain viable market share against competition. The low-volume traditional production process is halting local businesses to grow in scale and create a homogeneous brand name. Innovation and technology seems to reverse this challenge into opportunity, as it provides small producers with affordable means of promotion and quality assurance. Other challenges include the sustitution of local grape varieties with more popular productive ones and climate change, although the local varieties are particularly adapted to the mountainous rocky soil of Crete and tested for a period of centuries. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Tsikoudia is an essential part of local tradition and cuisine. The producers of the area of Hagia Varavara do the traditional distillation process and, unlike the majority of Cretan producers, they have moved forward to bottling, marketing through e-shops, and introducing new types of tsikoudia with different flavours. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Similar VCs based on legumes can be identified in Western Macedonia (MRL - NUTS3 : EL432, EL433, EL434)."
