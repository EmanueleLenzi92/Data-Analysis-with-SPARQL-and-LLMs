Organic garlic production, a joint enterprise of two small family businesses with modern machines purchased with the help of the local Leader LAG. High-quality garlic produced, cleaned, packaged and sold in a design package as Hungarian garlic through short supply chains. Members of European Territorial Quality Mark Bakonyi Local Brand trademark. Growing garlic in an organic way in the Bakony Mountains is a special, innovative idea. The product is sold through short supply chains, as Hungarian onions. They participate in a joint marketing system and are members of the European Territorial Quality Mark: Bakonyi Local Brand. It is also a quality assurance system and a marketing tool to promote products with a common logo. The trademark also creates cooperation between producers.   VC uses locally available lands for organic garlic growing. Good co-operation with agricultural producers and good connections with the local LEADER LAG, organising marketing and community actions.    Labor shortages are possible in this industry. Due to global trends, major changes are expected in the garlic market, Chinese competition is very strong. This is a new line of production in the arey (and for these particular businesses) made possible by climate change, there is some lack of knowledge and experience.. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Garlic is not a traditional product in the Bakony Mountains, also the special quality, the organic cultivation and the specialty of the packaging make VC innovative. An indigenous local producer manages this business with his son, the general agricultural production knowledge is endogenous. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
