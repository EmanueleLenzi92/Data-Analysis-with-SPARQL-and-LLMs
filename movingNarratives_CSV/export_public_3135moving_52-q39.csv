Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 14 CH2. The Swiss Federation of the Franches-Montagnes (FSFM) is the official breeding organisation whose aim is to develop and promote the breeding and use of horses of the Franches-Montagnes breed. It is made up of breeding syndicates, independent breeders and other organisations that support the breeding of the Franches-Montagnes horse and promote its use. The FSFM actively collaborates with the Swiss National Stud which depends on the FOAG (provision of stallions for breeders, promotion of the breed, advisory support, etc.). In the Jura canton, the Fédération jurassienne d'élevage chevalin (FJEC) groups together around 500 active breeders in the cradle of the Franches-Montagnes breed and holds more than a quarter of the breeding horses of the entire breed. The hair from this region has the label 'speciality of the canton of Jura'. There are 8 syndicats for the Jura canton.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura.

The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 111.98. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 364. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1607. The total population (in thousand) is 108.50. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 96.89. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.98%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25416.54. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Itis the only Swiss horse breed which is named after its region, giving the region a tourist feature and strengthening the cultural and landscape identity of the region (wooden pastures). Breeding is an official part of Switzerland's living traditions as listed by the Federal Office of Culture. It is the last light draught horse in Western Europe. The development of the breed is linked to a strong local know-how and organisation. There is also the political will at the Federal level to maintain the breed (with specific measures). The new products represent the genetic ressource that have derived from the adaptations. Recently, marketing strategis have been developped to increase the horse's value on the market.   The key local assets are espacially local know-how and cultural heritage. The first traces of horse breeding in the Jura is from the 17th century. Livestock farming is also based on wooded pastures which represent the typical landscape of the franches montagnes region.    There are no current perceived challenges. Sales have recently increased with covid. The composition of woodland pastures, and especially the presence of trees, suffers from summer droughts which can lead to a change in the general landscape on which the horses graze. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Constant adaptation of the breed and its organisation to the demand. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The breed now extends to the whole of Switzerland, and even on a European scale as breeding can be done throughout the country. A breeding organisation can extend these activities to another European country, if approved by the latter, but the VC remains in the reference landscape since it is differentiated with the label 'Spécialité du canton du jura'."
