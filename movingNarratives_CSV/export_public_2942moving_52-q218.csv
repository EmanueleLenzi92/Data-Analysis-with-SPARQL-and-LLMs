Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 RO. In 2019 there were a total of 39,501 bee families / hives registered in Brasov county for honey production - more than twice the amount registered in 1990 (INSSE data, 2021). The owners of these hives range from private households to commercial honey producers selling via many different value chains. These range from very local value chains to much longer value chains involving both the international sales of speciality honeys to the blending of honeys for mass sales via multiple retailiers. In all cases there is a clear need for honey producers to continue to work on product conformity and value chain development.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Bunești commune in Braşov County (RO122). Braşov county is a hilly mountainous region (500 - 2000 metres altitude) located in the south-eastern part of Transylvania. The relief is a diverse mix of mountainous (35%), hilly (50%) and lower altitude plain areas (15%) with an associated land use of forests (mainly in the mountain areas), permanent grasslands (mainly in the hilly areas), cultivated arable fields (in the hilly areas and lower altitude plains and hill areas) plus some urban, industrial and water surfaces (lakes and reservoirs).   The size of the area (km2) is 143.45. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 2.751. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 19.18. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 68.2. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.90%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 12600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6259.84. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 35.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 61.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 10000. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 21007.63. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 57.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 17795. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 39.20%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 47980. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 51.20%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 42.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 48.00%.   Bee-keeping is an important economic activity in Romania (especially in more marginal rural areas) which is recognised by the government and supported with appropriate interventions within the framework of a National Beekeeping Programme (https://www.madr.ro/programul-national-apicol.html). Beneficiaries of the programme include both individual beekeepers and beekeeping organisations. Available support includes specialist consultancy services; promotion of bee products; training courses; investment support for production and processing facilities (including direct support for transhumance of hives); subsidised medicinal products for varroasis; national level management of transhumance / pastoral beekeeping (especially important in the mountain areas); financial assistance for restocking (purchase of queens and bee families), and; analytical services for testing quality of honey.   There are many different types of honey produced in Braşov county depending upon the season and the vegetation that is flowering. The most common types are Acacia, Lime and Poliflora, but very specific local types such as 'mountain raspberry' and 'mountain pasture' honey are also produced. Organically-certified poliflora honey is also available.    The sector has great potential to grow both in terms of production capacity and consumer demand, but there is inevitably growing concern about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources due both to the intensification of arable cropping (including poor management of insecticides) and the abandonment of grasslands, especially in the mountain areas. The long-term effects of climate change and climate variability remain unknown but are likely to have negative impacts upon productivity of honeybees. Additional interventions are therefore needed to strengthen the capacity of beekeepers to adapt through integrating climate services with available indigenous knowledge and local practices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The specific value chain selected for this VC card is a social enterprise - AgroVision - set-up 14 years ago in the village of Crits in Brasov county to develop and present a model of modern small-scale farming to alleviate rural poverty and social exclusion. In 2018 AgroVision diversfied into honey production and started collecting, processing and marleting honey from local beekeepers under the brand of 'Marindar' (https://merindar.ro/about). This specific enterprise has been specifically chosen to highlight the potential importance of bee keeping and the honey value chain as a source of income for disadvantaged communities in the mountain areas of Romania. Agrovision now works with 650 beekeepers organised into 9 bee-keeping associations in five counties. They have donated hives and 2,600 bee families, provided training and support for small bee-keeping businesses and are working to promote bee-keeping to young people in 7 High Schools."
