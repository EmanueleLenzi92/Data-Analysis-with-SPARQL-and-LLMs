Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 38 ES. Cultivation has been developed basically in the last 50 years, in family farms. As a result, the harvest can reach 2.5 million kg. Marketing is done both through cooperatives and private companies, directed in an industrial format and around 70% go to the international market, especially Germany and Italy for the production of chocolates. The remaining 30% goes to the regional market. The province of Jaén is the main regional producer and the third in Spain. The sale prices to the industry do not reach one euro / kg while the regional sale offers better profitability. Some events organized by municipalities and the Provincial Council contribute to the local promotion of the product.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic Systems. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Castillo de Locubín. The extension dedicated to the cultivation of the cherry tree remains stable in the area, around 1,400 ha, with only the oldest trees being renewed. Cherry tree cultivation is complemented by other crops, especially olives. Landscape-wise, the flowering represents an opportunity to develop tourist activities, little exploited in the area, but important in places such as the Sierra de Gata (Cáceres) and Fundao (Portugal).   The size of the area (km2) is 102.49. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 600. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1250. The total population (in thousand) is 4.049. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 39.5. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.14%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9061.47. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 10686.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 14.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.48%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 148. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,03%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1287. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 40.6. In this region protected areas are not present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.11%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 21.62%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.27%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   It is the first stone fruit to reach the market, adapting very well to cold climates and high altitude cultivation. The diversity of varieties facilitates a staggered production and harvest, generating employment and boosting complementary economy in Sierra Sur and Sierra Mágina in the province of Jaén. Innovation is at a basic level and refers to initiatives in an initial stage of development and sectoral articulation strategies also in the initial launching phase.   In the Sierra Sur and Sierra Mágina, up to 9 different varieties are grown (Lamper, Burlat, Summit, Van..), thanks to the suitability of the soils and climate.    The main challenge is to improve sales prices to the industry, which do not cover production costs and represent 70% of the crop. On the other hand, spring storms may damage the earliest crop (80% of losses in 2020). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. This is a traditional value chain that has only slowly introduced initiatives to support marketing (Cherry Festival started in 1984 in Castillo de Locubín), some embryonic gastronomic proposals or liqueur production, but without further development as is happening in other areas (see Fundao in Portugal). The innovation is related to New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Different mountain areas account for cherry production in Spain (Alicante, Cáceres, Jaén). Poland, Italy, Spain, Greece and Hungary are the main cherry producing countries in the EU."
