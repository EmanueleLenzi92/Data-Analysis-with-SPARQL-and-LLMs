Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 IT. VC is partially dependent on other local VCs if we consider transformed products. For example, pasta and bread made from chestnut flour need to be mixed with wheat flour. The VC is also connected with the catering sector. Thus, the main actors are the farmers who cultivate the chestnut groves, the other actors in the processing and catering sectors, including the natural park authority, which define limits and opportunity for quality organic productions. Except for organic product certification, there is no certification of quality or origin of the products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Apennines - Calabria. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Petilia Policastro. Petilia Policastro is a mountain municipality settled in the Byzantine era. It is located 46 km eastern to Crotone, one of the larger town of the Calabria region, Southern Italy. The town relies on the production of olive oil, wine, cereals, citruses, and the breeding of cattle. The municipality is located in the National Park of Sila mountain.

This family farm enhances the value of a typical mountain product, the chestnut. The chestnut groves are cultivated organically. The farm owners follow the processing stages to offer customers both fresh and dried products and processed products such as pasta, flour, bread, jams and cakes with chestnut. Some of the processed products are made by local companies that use the Scalise farm's flour chestnut. The farm has a sales point in the town centre of Patilia Policastro. They also use other local products to enlarge their production, such as dessert sauce made by figs (called vincotto di fichi ). Innovation consists of re-proposing products that belong to the mountain tradition in a modern form. The farmer also diversifies the products obtained from processing chestnuts.   Chestnut groves have always been and element of the landscape of the SES and they are cultivated in a sustainable way. The owner of the farm has innovated the family's agricultural activity by revitalising chestnut products in a modern way. Traditional products, partially forgotten, are proposed as an element of cultural heritage to valorize.    Chestnuts are a product with a not large market, and it is necessary to devise new ways to use them (or recovering old use of chestnuts) that the market can appreciate. This entails an increased market risk for the farm. It is also necessary to establish commercial collaboration with other local players, particularly for processing and sales business activities. Moreover, climate change may affect the quality production of chestnut trees. Furthermore, this VC has no peculiar certification to characterize it as a local and traditional high-quality production. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. A traditional product with a reduced market, the chestnut, is cultivated organically and processed into flour, then used to prepare various products that belong to the mountain tradition (such as chestnut flour bread). The farm owner recovered these productions for a market that appreciates local food and wine traditions and environmental sustainability. Knowledge and skills used are developed locally by the family farm and belonging to the local tradition. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
