Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 43 ES. The sweets are mostly produced in small bakeries along the municipalities of Sierra Morena. In some cases the quality is guaranteed by the use of certified products such as PDO or organic olive oil, and other local products. However, the quality is mostly guranteed by the baker. The singularity of this VC is the use of traditional ingredients that come from the natural ecosystems and diverse traditional VCs (olive oil, nuts, honey, herbs, liquors or wine, pig fat).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Andújar. The MRL is crossed by the Guadalquivir river in its southern edge. The south of it presents an agricultural landscape dominated by olive plantations. Moving towards the north, the dehesa landscape begins where the landscape turns more hilly getting into the Natural Park, where some pyrenean oak patches appear in the upper altitudes. The fauna is very diverse, hosting many emblematic species, among which the Iberian linx stands out.   The size of the area (km2) is 964.33. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 200. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1283. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 37.97. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.50%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13566. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 10686.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 14.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.48%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 263. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 41.8. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 18.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 55.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   High quality products that have become part of the traditional recepies of the region. The use of local products from the mountain characterise their taste.   To maintain its connection with the local social-ecological-system by using local ingredients. Another challenge may be keeping the bakeries profitable if depopulation rates persist over time. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is present all along Sierra Morena: Huelva, Sevilla, Córdoba and Jaén."
