The characteristics of the territory such as soil, climate, altitude, slope, precipitation give the wines unique characteristics. Territory with a striking historical past in the area of viticulture and classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site (Alto Douro Wine Region and Coa Valley Archaeological Park). Currently, there are studies in progress to assess the impact of climate change in the Vale do Côa region. The 'CoaClimateRisk project - The impact of climate change and adaptation measures for the main agricultural crops in the Vale do Côa region' was recently approved. These forecasts will assist as a tool to support decision making by agents of the agricultural sector in the region, in the medium and long term. Rural tourism/wine tourism is a rapidly growing sector in the region, with an increase in the number of guests, overnight stays and hotel establishments. The promotion of creative and nature tourism in the villages of the municipality can effectively constitute an opportunity to keep the dynamism of these places active, constituted by a small number of inhabitants, bringing new business opportunities and differentiation of the existing products. We highlight the environmental conduct of some companies in the municipality. Some companies currently integrate concerns with nature, biodiversity and sustainability in their activity.   The municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa is integrated in the Douro Wine Region, the oldest demarcated and regulated wine region in the world, embraced almost entirely by the NUT III of the Douro. Due to its rugged orography and the slopes of its more or less pronounced hillside, viticulture practiced in the Douro Demarcated Region (RDD) is called mountain viticulture, a reference confirmed by data from the Joint Reseach Center/European Commission. The Man´s work in this landscape of rare beauty made it possible to establish populations, and it resulted in a living and evolutionary reality, proof of the past and the motor of the future, strongly anchored in the optimization of natural resources and the preservation of the environment. The region is characterized by a temperate and warm climate, Mediterranean type. In winter, the temperature is moderate, with solid precipitation rarely occurring. Summers are hot to very hot with temperatures above 30 C, reaching 40 in heat wave situations. In autumn and winter, rainfall is relatively abundant, with interannual variation, characteristic of Mediterranean climates. Spring and summer are dry, with rare rainfall in July and August. The region produces the world famous Port Wine, which has been around for three centuries in commercialization, in the international market, main vector of dynamizing the culture, traditions and economy. Port wine opened doors to the 'Douro wine which, with only two decades of existence, is increasingly referenced in the specialty's bibliography, revealing great potential and growing notoriety. As for complementary products from mountain regions, such as olive oil and almonds, these contribute to the preservation of the diversity of cultures, sustainability and the ecological balance and landscape of the Douro.    The municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa is characterized by having a dispersed population, for which the existence of agricultural soils (vines, almond and olive trees) is decisive, in an association of smallholdings with significant extensions of vineyards, where this is assumed as the predominant culture. Road accessibility has improved a lot in recent years, but it is still 'difficult' to get there. The impact of climate change in the Vila Nova de Foz Côa region have been similar to the environmental changes occurred in the rest of the Douro region. High temperatures Summers, heat waves, prolonged and intense droughts have been experienced throughout the region. These changes call into question the survival of some crops, including vines. The adaptation of the production methods and agricultural crops is essential. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Many companies present in the region with solid export volumes. Conversion of vineyards to organic production. Replanting old vineyard with the same traditional grape varieties. Investment by young farmers in the region through the production of wine (and olive oil). Growth of wine tourism, tourism supported by the skills of the municipality (wine, almonds, olive oil and schist) is fundamental for the development of the territory. Vila Nova de Foz Côa, over the years, has been prominent as a tourist destination. Landscapes, heritage, culture, traditions and gastronomy are the basis for the development of rural tourism. The Côa Museum stands out as a portal that allows visitors to discover the rock art of the Côa and Douro valleys.The Museum is also a welcoming center for researchers who wish to study the Côa, taking advantage of the largest national library dedicated to rock art. The region stands out for being the only one to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO - the paleolithic rock engravings located in the Côa river valley and the Alto Douro Wine Region. The innovation is related to New product, new process, new marketing strategy and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Crop land, grassland, forestry and natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
