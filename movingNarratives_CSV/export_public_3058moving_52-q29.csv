Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 25 ES. According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, in 2019, the production of beef cattle in Spain accounted for 6.3% of everything produced by the countryside, being the third most crucial livestock sector behind pork and poultry. Carne de Cervera de Pisuerga y de la Montaña Palentina is the guaranteed brand created in 1998, which certifies the region's beef products' quality. In 2011, Montaña Palentina Sociedad Cooperativa became part of Agropal Grupo Alimentario, which is currently in charge of its management, control, sale and distribution. The Carne de Cervera de Pisuerga y de la Montaña Palentina offers the following products: Ternera Blanca Lechal, Ternera Tradicional, and Añojo being the breeds suitable for meat production the Mountain Brown, Limousin and their crosses. In addition to the Quality Label, the product enjoys various distinctions such as 'Alimentos de Palencia' and 'Tierra de Sabor de Castilla y León.' The production area of origin extends to the 27 municipalities that make up the natural region of Montaña Palentina, while since 2010, the native and breeding area of the cattle, whose meat is protected by the Guarantee Label, has been extended to municipalities in the northern region of León and Burgos.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cantabrian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Cervera de Pisuerga. According to the Ministry of Agriculture criteria, the area under study is a region classified as a High Mountain Area. The orography and climate have traditionally marked the human activities and creations in the region. The Cervera sub-region is the least populated of the Palencia Mountains and the one with the highest population dispersion levels. This is due to its structure in small high mountain villages traditionally dedicated to extensive livestock farming. The Montaña Palentina has a natural environment and landscape of outstanding quality that is preserved, in a large part of the area, under three figures of protection: Montaña Palentina Natural Park, Covalagua Natural Area, and the Natural Area of Las Tuerces.   The size of the area (km2) is 325. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 950. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2500. The total population (in thousand) is 2.277. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 7. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.12%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 547. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,33%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 108. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 116. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 25.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 66.10%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 6.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 24.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 69.60%.   'The name 'Carne de Cervera' refers to meat backed by the quality of a priority breed, the pardo alpina, a natural diet, the meadows of the Mountains, and traditional management, with the animals being kept for nine months in the wild and the three winter months sheltered from the cold.   Most of the extensive livestock farming in the Cantabrian Mountains is located in the public utility forests managed by the Regional Ministry of Development and the Environment in collaboration with the local entities that own them, mostly local councils. The 450,000 hectares are divided into 350,000 hectares of 577 public utility forests in the Montaña Leonesa and 190,000 hectares of 286 public utility forests in the Montaña Palentina. It should be remembered that the Cantabrian Mountains account for more than 50% of the extensive livestock farming territory in the provinces of León and Palencia; in the case of the province of León, a total of 985 public utility forests, and in the case of Palencia, 493.    The great challenge of the area is the fight against depopulation, while the extensive cattle farming sector faces the challenge of profitability, diversification, continuity, and integration with other activities. A policy of social awareness regarding the key role of livestock farming for the region's future is essential, ensuring generational replacement, promoting quality and marketing, supporting short channels and means of marketing, and encouraging proper coexistence between livestock wildlife. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Although some signs indicate a willingness to innovate both in livestock management systems and in production and marketing processes, a traditional value chain model seems to prevail. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Extensive cattle farming has similar characteristics and problems throughout the Cantabrian Mountains and many other European mountain regions."
