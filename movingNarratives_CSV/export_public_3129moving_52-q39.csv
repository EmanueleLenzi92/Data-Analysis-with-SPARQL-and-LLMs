The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 111981.

Complementary product to the production of horses for sport and leisure, perpetuation of the Franches Montagnes breed, limitation of imports (90% in 2019), horses raised in wooded pastures which are strongly present in the Franches Montagnes region, high quality meat cheaper than cow meat. Instead of being incinerated, the horse is turned into a new product which is local meat. To promote the meat and counteract the taboos, sales strategies have been put in place such as promoting the local side with a horse raised directly in the wooded pastures without any feed supplement from abroad.   The key local assets are espacially local know-how and cultural heritage, same as for the Franche-Montagne horse breed. The first traces of horse breeding in the Jura is from the 17th century. Livestock farming is also based on wooded pastures which represent the typical landscape of the franches montagnes region.    The main challenge comes from the existing taboo around horse meat. Many meat consumers have an emotional bond with the animal and therefore refuse to eat it. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The objective is to add value to the meat of horses that are slaughtered for various reasons and to recognise the quality of this meat instead of incinerating it. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and social."
