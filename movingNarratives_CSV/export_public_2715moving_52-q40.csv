Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 AT. About 400 farmers are loosely connected with each other via the Osttiroler Lämmerring , which is a group within the Raiffeisen cooperative East-Tyrol. Both are of special importance for the producers since they are responsible for the marketing of about 75 % of the lambs (75 % of these are sold alive in eastern Austria and international, 25 % are slaughtered for the marketing in supermarkets). 25 % of the lambs are sold directly to consumers or the regional gastronomy.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Lienz (No: 707 = NUTS3: AT 333). East Tyrol is an exclave of the Austrian federal state of Tyrol, which has no border to the main federal sate of Tyrol. East Tyrol has a large share of the Hohe Tauern, with the highest mountains in Austria (241 peaks above 3000 meters are located in East Tyrol). Half of the district area lies above 2000 meters above sea level, with a large proportion of alpine areas. Approximately 9,1 percent is used for agriculture. The climate is harsh and dry. There are large microclimatic differences between the Lienz valley floor, the rugged Tauern valleys and the Gailtal valley with its high precipitation. East Tyrol shows complex geological patterns (limestone, primary rock, dolomite, metamorphic rocks of the 'Tauernfenster'). These, together with the different altitudes and climatic conditions, lead to a high local biodiversity of native alpine plants and herbs.   The size of the area (km2) is 2020.11. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 395. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 3660. The total population (in thousand) is 53.625. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 26.55. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.45%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 59.90. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 7.08%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 20326. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1533. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.17%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 36.27%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 62.56%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 20038. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 31258. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.73%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.41%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 70.87%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 19537. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 5.90%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2545. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 128. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.26%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.17%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 61.57%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.48%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 22.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.68%.   East Tyrol is one of the regions in Austria with the highest number and density of sheeps. Sheep farming in this region has been a tradition for centuries, mainly for wool production. Since the 1950s there has also been meat production due to high competition of the wool with synthetic fibers. Due to the topography and high altimetry cattle farming was not an option. Since 2006 this VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). The sheep plays a crucial role for the mountain farming in this region. Additionally, the maintainance of pasture farming is also important for the maintainance of the cultural landscapes which is important for hiking tourism. To secure the income the Genussregion and the marketing as a local speciality plays an important role for this VC.   Sheep farming has a tradition for centuries in this region. The shift to meat production in the 1950s was necessary to find new marketing opportunities. The cultural landscapes is important for the marketing strategy also the cultivated traditional sheep breeds.    The region is situated within the highest mountains of Austria and the topography of the mountains doesn t allow many practices. Sheep farming therefore is one of the few income possibilities for the mountain farmers. Climate change affects this region in regard to biodiversity loss and neophytes as well as a changing water balance. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The knowledge regarding the husbandry is considered to be traditional - also the cultivated races. The marketing as local speciality can be characterized as innovative. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   On average, 37, 8 sheep are kept per farm in East Tyrol. This stock size is an absolute top value when considered Austria-wide (16.4 sheep per keeper). Mountain sheep farming has also been traditional in 13 other regions in Austria (e.g. see VC AT 13 and 15) that are considered to have traditional sheep farming not all of them are mountainous regions."
