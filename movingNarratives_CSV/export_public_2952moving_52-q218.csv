Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 RO. All of the cheeses, including the 'Brânză de Burduf', that are marketed under the 'Stâna de Vaideeni' brand are produced in a licenced processing unit in the village. Cattle and sheep are milked in sheepfolds on the mountain pastures, but in the summer months these are very high and the milk can take up to 3 hours to get to the processing plant. The 'Brânză de Burduf' is made by adding rennet to the sheep's milk to curdle it. The resulting curd is removed into cheesecloth, drained and pressed overnight, then cut into pieces. Salt is added and the fresh cheese is kneaded by hand to achieve its characteristic texture and then placed into a sheep's stomach (or more commonly now an artificial substitute) for maturation. As explained above, the cheeses and other dairy products from 'Stâna de Vaideeni' are sold via a mix of direct marketing channels, including a farm shop, home-delivery scheme in neighbouring towns and online sales.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Vaideeni commune in Vâlcea County (RO415). The relief of Vâlcea County (RO415) is around one-third mountain area in the north of the county with a mixed land cover of forest and semi-natural grasslands. Two mountain groups dominate the region - the Făgăraș Mountains in the east with heights over 2,200 m and the Lotru Mountains in the west with heights over 2,000 m. These are separated by the Olt River valley (one of the most accessible routes through the Southern Carpathians), along which there are smaller groups of mountains - the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains. The central region of the county is sub-mountainous hilly area with a diverse mosaic landscape of fruit orchards, vineyards and semi-natural grasslands - and in the south there is high plain area cultivated with cereals and vegetables.

'Brânză de Burduf' is a traditional salted cheese with a strong flavour and unique texture. It is a very specific mountain product associated with the Southern Romanian Carpathians and there are numerous variants according to local tradition. This specific value chain is for a 'Brânză de Burduf' made from sheeps' milk by a farming family based in Vaideeni commune (174021) in Vâlcea County (RO415). The family is part of an agricultural cooperative with 13 members and trades under the brand name of 'Stâna de Vaideeni' ('Vaideeni Sheepfold') - see here: https://www.revista-ferma.ro/articole/afaceri-agricole/oameni-si-branduri-stana-de-vaideeni. The family produces around 10 different types of cheese from sheep and cows' milk, plus liquid milk and butter. All of the cheeses produced are registered as a 'Mountain Product', including the 'Brânză de Burduf' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-de-burduf-stana-de-vaideeni/).   The natural asset used for producing 'Brânză de Burduf' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing). Many of the communal pastures are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Value chains for traditional products such as the 'Brânză de Burduf' produced by the farming family in Vaideeni are vulnerable since there are many lower quality 'industrial' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but the business must remain competitive in the marketplace. This farming family relies heavily upon direct sales, but have chosen to diversify their outlets to mitigate against the risk of interruption / disruption. The ongoing depopulation of local villages and consequent loss of labour is a major challenge for the farming family and they work with other cooperative members to support each other with haymaking; communal grazing of their sheep and cattle, and; the transport of milk from their sheepfolds in the high mountain pastures. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
