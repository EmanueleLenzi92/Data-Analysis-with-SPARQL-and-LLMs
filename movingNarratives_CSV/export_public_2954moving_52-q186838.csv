Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 RO. 'Brănză Horezu' was first produced in the town of Horezu in the mountainous region of northern Vâlcea County (RO415) in 2001. All milk used for cheese production is collected daily from fixed 'milk collection' points where local sheep farmers and shepherds can bring their milk. Uncommonly for Romania, 'Brănză Horezu' is matured for a minimum of 5 months - most other cheeses are sold relatively fresh. In addition to being marketed under the 'Five Continents' label, it is also sold under the 'Cămara Noastră' (Our Larder) private label of Lidl Romania and the 'Gusturi Romanesti' (Romanian Tastes) brand launched the Mega Image supermarket network in 2009. The effective integration of the product into these mainsteam value chains now offsets much of the vulenerability commonly associated with mountain products in Romania.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Oraş Horezu commune in Vâlcea County (RO415). The relief of Vâlcea County (RO415) is around one-third mountain area in the north of the county with a mixed land cover of forest and semi-natural grasslands. Two mountain groups dominate the region - the Făgăraș Mountains in the east with heights over 2,200 m and the Lotru Mountains in the west with heights over 2,000 m. These are separated by the Olt River valley (one of the most accessible routes through the Southern Carpathians), along which there are smaller groups of mountains - the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains. The central region of the county is sub-mountainous hilly area with a diverse mosaic landscape of fruit orchards, vineyards and semi-natural grasslands - and in the south there is high plain area cultivated with cereals and vegetables.   The size of the area (km2) is 116.3. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 6.951. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 59.77. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 66.9. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.17%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2652.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 38.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.20%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 8100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 14241.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 7.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.70%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 11526. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 63.10%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 119190. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 34.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 28.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 36.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 38.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 34.50%.   'Brănză Horezu' is a hard pressed cheese made from pasteurised / fermented sheep's milk with a characteristic patterned rind. It is registered as a 'Mountain Product' (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/produs/branza-fermentata-din-lapte-de-oaie-horezu/) under Romania's implementation of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see more details below.   The natural asset used for producing 'Brănză Horezu' in the mountain areas of Vâlcea County (RO415) is mainly semi-natural grasslands (private meadows for hay-making and common pastures for communal grazing). Many of the communal pastures are high in the mountains and only grazed in the summer months.    Sheep are kept in Romania mainly for their milk and traditional dairy products. With the increased purchasing power and changing preferences of Romanian consumers there has been an increase in consumption of these dairy products, but also a clear demand for more sophisticated 'gourmet / speciality' cheeses (especially in urban areas and amongst young professionals). In part this demand has been met by imported cheeses, but it has also opened a niche for Romanian speciality cheeses such as 'Brănză Horezu' which is also widely known under the brand name 'Five Continents' (http://www.five-continent-srl.ro/index.html). The challenge now is maintaining this place in the market, especially since many new and interesting Romanian cheeses have entered the market in the last few years - including gourmet mature cheeses, blue cheeses and goat cheeses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
