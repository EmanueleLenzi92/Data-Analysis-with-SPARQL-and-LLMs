Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 49 ES. Harvesting requiers a traditional genrational knowledge. Mules and donkeys are mostly used to carry the cork to the warehouse. There are limited transformation plants in the mountain reference region, which means that the region loses the value added associated with the tranformation of the raw material. Portual is the key destination for the export of the raw material.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Hornachuelos. Most of its surface is part of the Hornachuelos Natural Park, the biggest protected area of the province. Its landscape is dominated by mediterranean forest with holm oaks, cork oaks and undergrowth, in addition to riverside woods of willows, ashes and alders. It also hosts a big diversity of aromatic plants and grass species; and it has high hydrological value, with two reservoirs, El Retortillo and Bembezar, standing within the town's boundaries. Hunting is another important activity of the mountain reference landscape. More than 60% of the area has a slope above 15%.   The size of the area (km2) is 585,84. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 144. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 789. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 4.93. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.30%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 10437. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13153.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 10.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.89%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 40. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 46.1. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 13.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.10%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 57.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   High quality cork is a specific product of the Mediterranean mountain areas. Cork oak trees have multiple benefits for the social-ecological-system, including carbon sequestration or prevention against erosion and desertification. Additionaly, they are considered as part of the cultural heritage of the region. Theese trees are one of the key elements of the dehesa landscape and its corresponding high multifunctionality and diversity.   The cork oak is an economic engine in rural areas with a significant lack of regular employment and at risk of depopulation.The improvement of the value chain through the support of digitalisation and the identification of vulnerability risks in order to make adaptation decisions is fundamental for the sustainability of this VC. Some specific challenges are the followings: new materials that compete with cork (plastic lids, synthetic porous materials, wax); reduced number of employees and lack of capacity building for the workers; plant diseases that attack the cork trees and hamper the cork production (e.x., Phytophthora); integrating the transformation process of the raw material in the region; stationallity of the harvest and the need to use mules for the work due to the land characteristics (accesibility and slope). In addition, these trees do not start being productive until they reach almost 50 years. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   This VC is present all along Sierra Morena, in Seville, Huelva, Jaén and Córdoba provinces."
