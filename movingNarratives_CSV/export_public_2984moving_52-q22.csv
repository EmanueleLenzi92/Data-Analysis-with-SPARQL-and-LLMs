Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 26 UK. Gin sales in the UK were around £2.6 billion in 2019. The UK is the world's largest exporter of gin and the number of distilleries has increased four-fold in the last 4 years. Within Gwynedd (LAU1), there are an increasing number of Gin distilleries, many of which also produce whisky and other liquers. Although the distilleries are based in the lowland areas of Gwynedd, but they use botanicals that grow in the upland areas. Furthermore, Blue Slate Gin (from Dinorwig distillery) is distilled in the mountains of Snowdonia and Dinorwig distillery carry out the full production (from distilling to labelling, marketing and shipping). They use mountain well water in the distilling process.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is West Wales (NUTS 2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Gwynedd. Gwynedd, in north west Wales, is most known for its spectacular mountain, lake and forest scenery, which features Snowdonia National Park and the highest mountain in Wales. The area is relatively isolated but is well-connected to north Wales and north west England by road and rail. The largest settlement, Bangor, is a small university city.   The size of the area (km2) is 2548.075142. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1085. The total population (in thousand) is 124.56.

The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 150.68. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.33%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 18362.69. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2990.81. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.36%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 30.76%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.88%.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 81.36%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.13%.

Gin produced in the UK is widely exported and highly regarded around the world. Small batch gin distilleries such as within Gwynedd are highly regarded due to their use of local botanical ingredients and connection to the local community and landscape. For instance, Blue Slate Gin (from Dinorwig Distillery) make just 2000 bottles a year but sell these globally, but also mostly locally at Gin Festivals. Dinorwig try to promote their products through both English and Welsh language. They worked with a local artist to design their labelling. Meanwhile, Dyfi gin is also produced in Gwynedd using upland botanicals and was chosen as Briatin's best gin at the Great British Food Awards 2017. It is possible for others that Gin is marketed as using rare botanicals from uplands but mainly produced in lowlands. The use of mountainous terrain/ climate for their botanicals has created a new type of gin (i.e. over and above traditional English Gin), as well as new processes for making gin. Gwynedd gins such as Dinorwig gin have also attempted new marketing and governance systems through dual-langague marketing and very local supply chains.   Natural assets: Gin in Gwynedd (I.e. Dinorwig) relies on the mountainous terrain and climate to produce the botanicals (e.g., coriander seeds, rosemary, oak bark, heather honey) for the gin. Also reliance on clean water for the distilling process. Social assets: good relations with the landowners to enable access to the mountainous water and botanicals. Cultural assets: Relies on traditional knowledge of the Gwynedd area and of gin distilling processes to create the Blue Slate Gin. Also strong links to welsh language, i.e. a;ways having a welsh speakers at their selling events (i.e. Gin festivals).    Gin is a big export market and so there are potential challenges in terms of BREXIT/ COVID, as well as closures ofhospitality due to COVID. Gin production in Gwynedd is reliant on mountainous climate/ terrain for the specific botanicals used in their distillation, as well as upland water (taken from a well). Changes in land use/ climate may impact on the quality of the gin that is possible. Also chnages in the fashionable/ 'trendiness' of gin may impact on the viability of gin production, as well as a saturated market due to ever increasing numbers of gin distilleries across the UK. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Gin as a product is not new, however the processing of gin in upland areas such as Gwynedd is new and innovative. There has also been a massive increase in gin production across the UK recent years, i.e. within whisky distilleries and to meet the growing demand of local and flavoured gins (and increased demand from younger generation as gin is now considered a 'trendy' drink). The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry, Natural land and upland water. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Gin is also produced throughout the UK in multiple LAU1s (e.g. Aberdeenshire, Newry and Mourne, Caithness and Sutherland) with over 600 distilleries across the UK. Many gin distillers also produce whisky. Other gin produced in Gwynedd (Aber Falls flavoured gins) is stocked across Tesco supermarkets, however its links to upland areas is not clear."
