Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 40 ES. The chestnut is a wild product traditionally used in many dishes. Nowadays its use has been reduced significantly in the cuisine. However, the product has high nutritious value and possibilities of transformation (flour, jam, bakery sweets). In this MRL we can find a company that produces organic chestnuts (harvested from natural forest), clean them and prepare them to be sold within the country and aborad (USA, Canada and Eastern Europe). The organic certificate is given by the Andalusian Comitee of Organic Agriculture.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Galaroza. The MRL is located at the core of the Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche Natural Park. Its main production is wood furniture. The region is covered by a dense mediterranean forest and dehesas.

High quality product connected with the natural ecosystem, the chestnut forest. The raw product is commercialised in the national market and also experoted to USA, Canada and Eastern Europe. New processes linked to the fruit selection, packaging and the sale and marketing. There are also small companies selling elaborated products based on chestnuts.   Move beyond the raw product, innovating with it and adding value to it. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The chestnuts have the organic certification and in Galaroza are harvested, manipulated and packed in a big plant to be sold to big retailers. The innovation is related to the preparation plant that is equiped with modern technology, merging a traditional product with novel technologies. Within the region, other small companies are innovating in the product, transforming the chestnuts into jam, flour, and other elaborated products. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   This VC is also present in Castaño del Robledo (21022)."
