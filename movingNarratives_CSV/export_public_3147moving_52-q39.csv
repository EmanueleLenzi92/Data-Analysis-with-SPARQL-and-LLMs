Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 54 CH2. This VC is broad and includes all producers, slaughterhouses, retailers (department stores, local butchers and direct sales depending on the farms). Farmers must comply with strict specifications (those of the Swiss Mother Cow Association and of Swiss organic production). It is a large, highly organised and supervised VC.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corgémont; Cormoret; Cortébert; Courtelary; La Ferrière; Mont-Tramelan; Orvin; Renan (BE); Romont (BE); Saint-Imier; Sonceboz-Sombeval; Sonvilier; Tramelan; Villeret; Sauge; Péry-La Heutte; Belprahon; Champoz; Corcelles (BE); Court; Crémines; Eschert; Grandval; Loveresse; Moutier; Perrefitte; Reconvilier; Roches (BE); Saicourt; Saules (BE); Schelten; Seehof; Sorvilier; Tavannes; Rebévelier; Petit-Val; Valbirse; La Neuveville; Nods; Plateau de Diesse; Hauenstein-Ifenthal; Kienberg; Lostorf; Rohr (SO); Trimbach; Wisen (SO); Oberhof; Bullet; Concise; Fiez; Fontaines-sur-Grandson; Grandevent; Mauborget; Mutrux; Novalles; Provence; Sainte-Croix; Tévenon; L'Abergement; Ballaigues; Baulmes; Juriens; Lignerolle; La Praz; Premier; Vallorbe; Vaulion; L'Abbaye; Le Chenit; Le Lieu; Vugelles-La Mothe; Boudry; Cortaillod; Rochefort; La Grande Béroche; La Chaux-de-Fonds; Les Planchettes; La Sagne; Les Brenets; La Brévine; Brot-Plamboz; Le Cerneux-Péquignot; La Chaux-du-Milieu; Le Locle; Les Ponts-de-Martel; Cressier (NE); Enges; Lignières; Val-de-Ruz; La Côte-aux-Fées; Les Verrières; Val-de-Travers; Boécourt; Bourrignon; Châtillon (JU); Courchapoix; Courrendlin; Courroux; Courtételle; Delémont; Develier; Mervelier; Rossemaison; Saulcy; Soyhières; Haute-Sorne; Val Terbi; Le Bémont (JU); Les Bois; Les Breuleux; La Chaux-des-Breuleux; Les Enfers; Les Genevez (JU); Lajoux (JU); Montfaucon; Muriaux; Le Noirmont; Saignelégier; Saint-Brais; Soubey; Clos du Doubs. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 218.62. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 383. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1650. The total population (in thousand) is 245.48. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 112.29. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.82%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 27254.85. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 26722.71. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 3534. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 3.79%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2267. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 55. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 5.02%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 42.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 52.16%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   This product is of high quality, respecting strict specifications for a label guaranteeing an organic and ethical production closer to consummer's demand, ensuring that the calf grows with its mother, connected to cattle farming which is the main farming system in Switzerland (representative of swiss agriculture).   The main asset is natural as it includes the pastures on which the cattle feed and the cropands that produce cattle food for winter.    The natural resources on which cattle feed are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Natural.   The VC is much larger than this landscape region, since the labelling, production and sales are carried out throughout Switzerland. On this landscape, there are four slaughterhouses that produce Naturabeef and allows for the delineation of the Mountain Reference Landscape."
