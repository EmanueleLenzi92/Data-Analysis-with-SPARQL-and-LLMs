'Local Gastronomic Points' offer a family-type culinary experience based upon the hospitality of local households and the traditional food they commonly prepare according to their own local culture and using their own local ingredients. This form of initimate 'gastronomic tourism' started in one community in the Carpathians (Vama Buzăului) in Braşov county and is now spreading to other communities. In addition to Brașov there are currently Local Gastronomic Points in three other counties (Covasna, Sibiu and Tulcea) and together this growing network is known as 'GASTRO LOCAL'. The first Local Gastronomic Point was established in 2019 in Vama Buzăului commune in response to the need to offer the increasing number of tourists visiting the area a real, safe, unique culinary experience in the local villages. This need exists in many other mountain areas and the concept of a Local Gastronomic Point is very straightforward to replicate. It is also a very good way to build community spirit and social capital through cooperation - whilst improving household incomes and selling increased quantities of local food and drink. .   Local hospitality at the level of individual households and the quality of the local food and drink they serve to their visitors.    The main challenge remains the consistency of the 'product' offered to tourists. This can be highly variable within the households cooperating within one Local Gastronomic Point (i.e. at village / commune level) and between Points. There are also issues with food safety and hygiene (a common challenge also for many small food businesses) and an important additional activity has been to form an alliance with the public health authorities in Brașov county to jointly prepare a good practice guide for establishing a 'Local Gastronomic Point' that is fully compliant with all national and EU legislation.

Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The concept of Local Gastronomic Points is a very new approach for Romania and grew from recognition that the traditional hospitality of the Romanian village could be exploited collectively by the community as a source of income - in other words, it combines tradition with an innovative new business opportunity. Almost a form of 'retro-innovation'. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Grassland. The local assets include Social and cultural."
