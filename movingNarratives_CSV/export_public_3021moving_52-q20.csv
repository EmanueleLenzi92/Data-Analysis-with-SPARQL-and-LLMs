High quality product with long history and Demeter bio-dynamic certification.   The main natural asset is the climate. This region has one of the driest weathers of the European Northern Countries with high amount of direct sun hours, which makes it adequate for aromatic herbs growing. The social assets start with their values linked to Demeter bio-dinamic philosophy. Besides, through Gudbrandsdalsmat SA they commit to a cooperation among local producers that share a concern about their territory and the practices they perform on it.    As they directly sell their products from the farm to the consumers, the restrictions in mobility and lower tourism due to COVID-19 Pandemic may have negatively impacted their activity. In this sence, the important role of the local producers' cooperative sshould be highlighted for its supporting role in developing an online store.
