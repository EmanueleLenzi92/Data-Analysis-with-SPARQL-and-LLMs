Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 CZ. Chicken husbandry is present on many farm located in the mountain region. There are a few farms that directly specialize on chicken meat production. These farms keep chickens and also process meat, which they directly sell. The most common marketing chanells are eshops, farmers markets and farmers shops in towns. Some farms also have their own restaurants, where they use the chicken meat, which they produce on their own. Such combination creates many positive synergies for their business. The VC is succesfull in providing alternative to conventional large-scale chicken husbandry. It makes sense to pay attention to this VC within the MOVING project, because this VC is still underusing the local potential. Improving the ability to utilize the local assets would positively effect the impacts of this VC in terms of ecology and economy.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Klatovy. Moountainm Reference Landscape is very diverse. The area of the region (LAU 1 Klatovy) is covered by 46 % by agricultural land. About 55 % of the agricultural land is arable. Lower areas of the region (LAU 1) are suitable for relatively intense production of crops (including wheat and rape seeds). Upper areas are suitable for potato production. The south-western borders of the region neigbor the Germany. This is the area of the Sumava mountains. Due to the large share of the areas with high altitude there are many areas covered with forests. About 43 % of the region's areas are covered with forests.   The size of the area (km2) is 1946. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 250. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1370. The total population (in thousand) is 86.405.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 40.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.60%.   Chicken production belongs among examples of small-scale farms located in the mountain region Sumava. Chicken husbandry and chicken meat production creates important linkage with urban areas, because there is a hugh demand for chicken meat that comes from un-conventional farms. Specialized farms are often detached from plant production, since they buy feedstuff for the chickens. Chicken producers develop specific niche that competes with industrial large-scale farms. Some farms are trying to certify their farm process and refer to a specific quality scheme. However, these examples are quite rare. The small-scale farms of this kind are very important for elaborating local food production that valorizes local assets. One of the key challenges for the VC would be the localization of inputs that are used for feeding chickens. Despite the traditional nature of the VC, there is a potential for innovating marketing strategy just like in case of other alternative food networks.   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The chicken producers are using the local assets only partly (since the feedstuff for the chickens is often imported to the farm). Operating the farm requires specific social and expert skills. Chicken husbandry is a typical activity that belong among the rural traditions.    Chicken production on small-scale farms faces a challenge related to profitability and animal welfare. The examples of small-scale chicken farms play very important role in shifting the food production towards more local food production and consumption. Since the chicken husbandry does not directly rely on land, the farms can be also located in mountain regions where the arable land is scarce. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The VC is considered a traditional, because it imeplements established farm practices. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are The chicken husbandry does not rely on 'land', since the inputs are often transported to the farm. The VC rely available technology and skills of farmers. The local assets include Cultural."
