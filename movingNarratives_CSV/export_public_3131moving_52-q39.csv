Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 CH2. The VC has 237 dairy farms, 9 cheese dairies and 2 ripeners. It is labelled with the protected designation of origin (pdo) and can therefore only be produced in a limited area straddling two cantons. It is organiised by three associations: Interprofession Tête de Moine who asked for the label, Association of tête de moine producers and the Association of involved dairy farmers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corgémont; Cormoret; Cortébert; Courtelary; La Ferrière; Mont-Tramelan; Orvin; Renan (BE); Romont (BE); Saint-Imier; Sonceboz-Sombeval; Sonvilier; Tramelan; Villeret; Sauge; Péry-La Heutte; Belprahon; Champoz; Corcelles (BE); Court; Crémines; Eschert; Grandval; Loveresse; Moutier; Perrefitte; Reconvilier; Roches (BE); Saicourt; Saules (BE); Schelten; Seehof; Sorvilier; Tavannes; Rebévelier; Petit-Val; Valbirse; Saulcy; Le Bémont (JU); Les Bois; Les Breuleux; La Chaux-des-Breuleux; Les Enfers; Les Genevez (JU); Lajoux (JU); Montfaucon; Muriaux; Le Noirmont; Saignelégier; Saint-Brais; Soubey; Clos du Doubs. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 75.26. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 415. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1606. The total population (in thousand) is 59.13. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 78.57. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.95%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 24718.16. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 24391.03. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1085. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 1.16%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 879. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 75. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.21%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 43.17%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 48.31%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Successfull registration of a quality scheme and territorial identitiy with a PDO, high quality product; maintenance of a high milk price for the dairy producers in the VC (in the face of competition and the opening up of markets with EU), thus maintaining the pasture and the landscape, contributes to the maintenance of extensive grazing in wooden pastures. The processes have not changed. The innovation is linked to the capacity of farmers and other acotrs to organisze themeselves (governance systems) and place their product on the market thanks to the invention of the girolle (new product).   Milk is produced from cattle on extensive grazing systems, often in wooden pastures. The cheese production is based on traditional knowledge dating back to the 17th century. The current pdo organization demonstrates furthermore social ressources, such as interactions among farmers and cheese producers, to maintain a sufficient milk price.    The natural resources on which the milk used for cheese production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Counterfeit of the 'girolle' have emerged on the market, which represents direct competition and takes away the unique and innovative aspect of the product. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The invention of the 'girolle' in 1999 following a reorganization of the actors in a PDO in 1997, represents an innovation since it placed the cheese as an unique product on a niche market (feast and costly), and allowed a big increase in the production. The girolle is a wheel that which allows the cheese to be scraped to form small flower. The innovation is related to New products and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The VC is in two different cantons. The selected reference landscape does only take into consideration the Franches Montagnes Region in the Jura canton and not in the Bern canton, beceause considering the canton of Bern greatly biases the population and economic figures at a NUTS2 level."
