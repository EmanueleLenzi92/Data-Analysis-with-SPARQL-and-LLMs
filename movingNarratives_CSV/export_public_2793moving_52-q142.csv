Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 FR. The beekeeping activity is guided by the body responsible for managing the PDO. But other organizations bring together other professional and non-professional beekeepers outside the PDO. Which have different visions of the profession and management systems. A major challenge is to design public action adressed to the activity for the services provided by beekeeping to the environment and the damage it suffers due to the weakening of resources and the production of honey.However, the value of Corsican honeys is linked to the range of PDO honeys and therefore to the preservation of the diversity of natural environments today weakened by climate change.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. The value chain concerns all the corsican region because of the mobility of apiaries from littoral to medium and high mountain in the same way.the production of chestnut honey is widespread and requires a stay of 1 to 2 months in mid-mountain areas, often near villages.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   The fame of Corsican honey is old but its contemporary reputation results from the professionalization of the activity since 1980 and subsequently from a recognition consecrated by obtaining a PDO in 1998. The PDO brings together six honeys, four of which are produced from the spontaneous flora of the maquis. Except in winter, which is the season during which bee colonies rest, there is one honeydew per season. The definition of honey and its controls are based upon its taste and pollen analyzes, reflecting the foraging areas (heather, asphodel, lavender, broom, oaks, anthilli, thyme, etc.). The value of honey is very directly linked to the management of apiaries in a set of varied environments exposed to climate change. The location of the apiaries is strategic for the production of different honeys, especially those located in the mountains. The value is therefore dependent on the melifer and pollen potential of the foraging areas and the ability of beekeepers to choose the right locations.   The weak industrialization of Corsica and the way in which apiaries are managed, which use several layers of vegetation, are the assets. They also show as many dependencies to the local environment as there are types of vegetations/forageing areas, and as many potential vulnerabilities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. However, global warming is modifying production cycles and honey flow. Beekeepers are forced to practice transhumance and often to breed queens to face news challenges.The sharp drop in production leads beekeepers to borrow breeding techniques, especially breeding queens, and to resort to feeding practices. The challenge is to continue to produce each of the honeys in the PDO range, in particular summer honeys - in decline due to drought and access to the mountains - and chestnut groves affected by cynips disease and drought . The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural.   It is present in every MRLs : Austria, Czech republic, Crete, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia."
