Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY UNIMOL and UNIPI. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 36 IT. The cheese is produced only with milk from the 'Podolica' cow which is a local breed. The processing relies on tranditional activities which are mostly performed at the farm. Thus, farmers are the main actors of the VC. The product is mainly sold on-farm or in local markets. 'Caciocavallo dei Monti Dauni' holds the label of 'Traditional Food Italian Product'. For such products a production specification scheme needs to be followed and it dictate that milk only from wilde and semi-wild breed Podolica cows must be use to produce the cheese only using traditional production techniques. For all these reasons, the product is considered an identity of the area.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Appennines. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Monteleone di Puglia.

The Caciocavallo cheese holds the national label of 'Traditional Food Italian Product' and it can be considered an territorial identity of the area. The product valorise a cow breeding ('Podolica') tipical of Southern Italy and it is produced valorizing local traditions and cultural know-how. The connection with the land use system is strong, since the cheese can only be produced by 'Podolica' cows bred through the wild or semi-wild systems. The amount of product available for the market is limited. Thus, besides the local makets and on-farm selling, producers started to exploit alternative marketing strategies to reach larger consumer communities such as e-commerce and on-farm selling connected with hosting activities.   The area is characterised by a higlhy mixed land use system, where forests and natural grassland the dominant land use systems in the interplay with agricultural land. The 'Podolica' cow breed is traditional asset of the Southern Italian regions, characterized by lower milk production compared with intensive cow breed (e.g., Frisona, Pezzata Rossa), but very much suited for breeding through in wild and semi-wilde systems.    The Caciocavallo cheese is produced in a very remote mountain area with a market trait of rurality which is affected by ageing population and depopulation. The remoteness of the area make it difficult for the active part of the population to share formal and informal knowledges and experiences that can promote the valorisation of local natural (busheses, woods, and natural grass land) and human (traditional know-how) resources . Additionaly, intensive agriculture production drastically reduced the areas dedicated to natural land, natural grassland, and thus, the activities connected with traditional livestock activities such as the 'transumanza'. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The cheese is moinly produced on farm with very few number of larger processors in the territory and thus a limited amount of product available for the market. For these reasons, producers are exploring alternative marketing strategies besides local markets, such as e-commerce and on farm selling (usually coupled with agritourism actvities). The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is present within the two mountain areas present in the Province of Foggia (NUTS3: ) ('Gargano' and 'Monti Dauni')."
