Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 SER. Local wild berries picked by local people in order to supplement their incomes. Pure natural product dependent on the state of the natural system. Local knowledge of the terrain and growing conditions is required in order to find the berries and pick them at the right moment. Since pickers are usually the poor local people, their bargaining and negotiating power is most likely reduced and they depend on what the purchasing stations are willing to pay them. Most producers/processors further down the VC adhere to at least one quality scheme such as the HACCP standard.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Kopaonik Mountain/ National park, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Dinaric Mountains, mountain Kopaonik. Kopaonik National park and its vicinity have been a poligon of mass winter sports tourism in the last decades. BEing the highest peak in Serbia, there has always been a lot of pressure of visitors and even increased lately. Kopaonik owes its name to its abundance of mineral resources. To this day, ores of iron, lead and zinc, as well as silver and gold, can be found in the bottom of the mountain.Today, Mt. Kopaonik is the number one ski resort in Serbia and the wider region, still with lots of construction and tourism that are seen as the best development opportuity. At the same time, there is diverse plant and animal life, as more than a thousand plant species grow here, including Kopaonik's houseleek, Kopaonik's violet and Pančić's bittercress as the most famous among them. Wood and non timber forest products such as wild berries and mushroms are supplementatry income for many of the locals, without enough consideration on the impact made. Still unsustainable and even illegal construction make the strongest pressure on the mountain at this moment.   The size of the area (km2) is 606. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2017. The total population (in thousand) is 14.60. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 24.09. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -11.75%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 78618. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4547. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 97.2. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 37.70%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 50.70%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.20%.

'Wild blueberry' and other NWF products are collected and used for domestic products and local specialities in the area of Kopaonik mountain / very well known touristic area. Many products are also exported / cold pressed juices, lyophilised fruits, etc. Opposed to cultivation of blue berry in the region, these berries grow in the wild, are hand picked by locals and offered to the same processing VC as the cultivated ones with the added attribute of being wild. Amounts that can be picked is determined by government regulations via permits in order for the sustainable use of this resource. This product is potentially a niche market for more health and ecological oriented consumers who would prefer wild berries over cultivated ones. For this, the VC down the line would have to devise new marketing strategies and create new markets for instance in health shops, green markets, pharmacies.   People that pick the wild berries are local people that supplement their incomes with picking the wild berries. They sell them to local purchasing stations that then pass them on to the same processing facilities that serve the cultivated berries.    Since the wild berries are sold to purchasing stations and from there find its way further through the VC, the same challenges regarding underused capacity, lack of effective marketing strategies, etc. apply. On top of that come the problems posed by the effects of climate change such as drought, late season frost, etc. In addition, while for the cultivation of blue berries stable production and quality via applying cultivation techniques can be assured, this does not apply for wild berry picking which is dependent on local climatic and soil conditions. Wild berries are not always easy to find and don't have the same characteristics over various season thereby not guaranteeing stable quality. Other challenges could lie in picking at the wrong moment (too soon or too late) or overpicking thereby damaging the sustainable use of this resource. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. There is no innovation in the picking of wild berries. Hand picking is done by traditional means. The only 'innovation' would be that the berries can be labelled as wild and 'from Nature' as opposed to their cultivated cousins. No information about this labelling further down the VC with especially marketing techniques targeting specific segments of the consumer market could be ascertained at this moment. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
