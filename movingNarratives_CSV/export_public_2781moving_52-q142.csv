Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 FR1. Drome stone fruit value chain is a well established value chain. The main production are peaches and abricots with an average size of the orchard are 15ha. The main cultural system is conventionnal agriculture in monoculture. Fruits are collected by cooperatives actors (Lorifruit, Rhodacoop), marketers and wholesale. Theses prodcuts are mostly driven to long supply chain distribution and export. Abricot des Baronnies (south of Drome) is currently in the process of obtention of an IGP. Stone fruits cultures are currently facing strong pressure due to climate change: more and more freezing episodes in the spring, water scarcity as well as invasion of disease and parasites. To adapt, various strategies are tested: fight against frost with heating technics, fight against disease with treatments, insect nets, diversification of produced variety and fruits. In parallel, an organic production of stone fruits is developping. They are facing the same challenges but using different cultural practices to saveguard biodiversity (introduction of nesting box, chickens in the orchyard) and seeking to diversifying (new fruit culture more adapted to climatic conditions). Organic producers are more driven to direct sale and local market channels.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Drome Valley. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Drome departement. Drôme is a very diversified departement in terms of geological, natural and agricultural resources. The North-East of the territory is characterised by middle and high mountains (Pre Alps and Vercors Natural Park): agriculture is this area is mainly livestock and small diversified gardening. The South is characterized by the beginning of the Provence and the mediterranean climate, we can find there aromatic and yard large cultures. The West of the territory is characterized by plains were the Rhône and the Drôme rivers meet. Agriculture ther is mainly large cropland. Within the Drôme departement, Biovallée territority gathers 3 associations of municipalities (EPCI) - 95 muncipalities in total. It is a very preserved and diversified territory, following the Drôme River, from Pre Alps to large plains of the downvalley.   The size of the area (km2) is 2200. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 50. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2453. The total population (in thousand) is 58.56. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.3. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.6%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 14532.49. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 20.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 77.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 32799. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 242040. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 24.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 74.30%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 56167. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 37%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 6400. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 115. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 24.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 71.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.10%.   Stone fruits is representative of Drôme fruit production. Main productions are abricot and peaches, mainly produced in conventional agriculture orchards and driven to large-scale supply or export. One quality scheme is in the process of being acquired (Indication Géographique Protegée) for Abricot des Barronies (south of Drôme). New products: diversification of species adapted to climate change: more resistant species, grenades, almonds New processes: technics to fight against freezing episode, technics to favour biodiversity protection in orchyards, agroforestery.   Natural asset: eastethic landscape Social asset: creation of local job and local value Cultural asset: contribution to Drome territorial identity, gastronomy and attractivness.    Stone fruit production is strongly treathen by freezing episode. In 2021, 80% of the Drome stone fruit production was frozen. Stone fruit production also faces disease and parasites. The current challenge is to find solutions to fight freezing episodes but also to diversify towards more adapted cultures. Due to the climatic crisis, the VC depends on regional public aids. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation stands in the fact that the stone fruitd VC is currently diversifying to face freeing episode challenge: production of new species such as grenade, almonds which are adapted to climate change and responding to new consumer demand. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Stone fruit is a VC present in all Auvergne Rhones Alpes region but Drôme is the first departement in terms of organic production."
