Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 GR. Key activities include the collection of raw material, sifting out small stones, leaving the raw materials under the sun and laying them in plastic bags. All these activities are applied by indepentent producers and no intermediaries are engaged in this process. In many interactive workshops, tourists and clients have the opportunity to participate in this process. The partnership with the Psiloritis UNESCO geopark has enhanced and given notoriety to the pottery production traditions and their ties to the landscape. Also, further synergies have been developed with local enterprises of the UNESCO Global Geopark resulting in a local quality label, the Psiloritis Land that characterises products and services of the territory. A plan for sustainable development is under implementation by the Management Committee supporting initiatives that focus on geotourism, local art and culture promotion, as well as strengthening local economy.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is PSILORITIS MOUNTAIN. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is MARGARITES. Psiloritis mountain is a Unesco territorial site. Mountain Idi (Psiloritis) is the highest in Crete reaching up to 2,456 m.The volcanic elements in the soil make the mountain unique for use in pottery. These traditions are part of the culture for centuries. Moreover, the ancient myths surrounding the mountain bring tourists to the area. The mountain is contribuous to sustainable development, since it's the focus of geotourism, where local art and culture are promoted, all of which strengthen the local economy.

The pottery and ceramics products in Margarites village are made of local soil and schist, a kind of soil of very high granularity and concentration in argyle extracted from Psiloritis Mountain. Hence, the activities are highly relevant to the ample reserve of clay found in the surroundings of Mountain Ida or Idi (Psiloritis) 2,456 m (8,058 ft). Margarites pottery workshops have partnered with Psiloritis UNESCO Global Geopark. The Geopark is characterized by great geodiversity and biodiversity expanding the pottery tradition's impact into tourism, maintaining the cultural heritage, sustainable village development, and preserving the biodiversity. More than 23 potters exist in this village. ""Psiloritis UNESCO Global Geopark"" was recognized as such in 2015 since then Psiloritis geopark plays an active role in the global efforts for the conservation and promotion of the environment, of the natural and cultural heritage, as well as of the sustainable local development through the geo-tourism and the other kinds of alternative tourism. Regarding the Margarites Village Pottery and Ceramics, the natural traditions and cultural knowledge are part of educational programs in schools, educational, and cultural institutions from Greece and abroad. In addition, thematic and cultural tourism is beginning to flourish in the region. There are 23 potters and their workshops in the village continuing a centuries old tradition. Hence, a community of practice is well-established. They produce pots and ceramics for household and ornamental use. Pottery making, workshops, and the long history of the cultural traditions support thematic and cultural tourism with heritage craft themes contributing to the preservation of these forms of cultural heritage and concomitantly sustaining village life. The natural landscape in the Municipality of Mylopotamos includes many raw materials that are connected to this value chain. Margarites village has a pottery and ceramics tradition dating back centuries. Pottery is one of the oldest arts developed in Crete from 3000 BC and current pottery-production activities and techniques are similar to those traditionally applied. Psiloritis geopark, in co-operation with the Municipalities, the University of Crete and other Bodies of the local authorities and communities, developed the appropriate infrastructure to provide to both its inhabitants and its guests a high quality life in a non-urban environment.The geopark also plays an active role in the promotion of the natural and cultural heritage, as well as of the sustainable local development through the geo-tourism, cultural tourism, and thematic tourism. Potters from all around the world participate in the summer festivals of pottery in Margarites. Overtourism is a possible risk for Crete Island as a whole. Another risk is the less time-consuming forms of producing ceramic goods for local and tourist consumption. The governmental measures to restrict the spread of covid-19 have dramatically reduced the number of tourists that visit Margarites. Urbanization is a major challenge, since the village has become a tourist attraction leading to the construction of new housing and buildings. Potters have to search for a supplementary income, since the income from the production of ceramic goods is very low during the winter months. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Techniques of pottery production are mostly traditional and date back to the Neolithic period. The innovations concern: 
a. new products. While in the past, the focus was on products of practical utility, in the present more and more products (souvenirs) of decorative use are constructed. 
b. new processes (mix of innovative (e.g. use of blue glaze) and traditional techniques (e.g. use of potter wheel). 
""Psiloritis UNESCO Global Geopark"" was recognized as such in 2015 and since then Psiloritis geopark plays an active role in the global efforts for the conservation and promotion of the environment, of the natural and cultural heritage, as well as of the sustainable local development through the geo-tourism and the other kinds of alternative tourism. Regarding the Margarites Village Pottery and Ceramics, the natural traditions and cultural knowledge are part of educational programs in schools, educational, and cultural institutions from Greece and abroad. In addition, thematic and cultural tourism is beginning to flourish in the region. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. The VC is present in different parts of the country, but in the island of Crete only four pottery centers exist. Moreover, the Margarites village is the one that has the privilege to the particular soil from Psiloritis that is used to make the pottery."
