The Maleshevski mountain offers very good condition for further development of NTFP, including medicinal herbs. Medicinal herbs, as a NTFP product, have a big potential in the region of Maleshevija. This product has a good potential to involve local collectors through clear tenured rights, better collection methods, capacity development, infrastructure and institutional support in near future.
