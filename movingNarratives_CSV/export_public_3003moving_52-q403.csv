Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 SER. Key actors are suppliers (pickers), purchase stations, producers (enterprises), wholesale distributors, middlemen and retailers. Small producers with expert knowledge on how to cultivate and process the berries. VC dependendent on the local and natural conditions which are amply available but under threat of the effects of climate change, predomintantly drought, excessive rain, late season frost and hail storms. Strongly connected to local cultural traditions and important contributor to local culture. Important contributor to fruit production in Serbia and to export to other countries. New marketing strategies as well as innovative production and processing facilities could potentially contribute strongly to increased production and export. Most producers/processors adhere to at least one quality scheme such as the HACCP standard.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Kopaonik Mountain, Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Dinarid mountains, mountain Kopaonik. Kopaonik Mountain Western Serbia, Dinaric Arc. The highest point is the Pančić's Peak with 2,017 m. In 1981, due to its location, climate, rich forests, variety of herbs, and area for holiday and recreation, 121.06 km2 of the range were proclaimed a national park. Stretching for 75 km in the north-south direction, between the rivers of Lab and Sitnica on the south and Jošanica on the north, Kopaonik is one of the largest and longest mountains in Serbia. It belongs to the administrative region of Raška. The Kopaonik mountain massif includes the mountains of Kopaonik, Željin, Goč and Stolovi. The Pančić's Peak, with 2,017 m is the highest point of the mountain. Kopaonik has a continental climate with fresh summers, and long, cold winters with abundant snowfall. The snow season lasts from November to April, while there are around 200 sunny days. On the slopes of Kopaonik there is Kopaonik ski resort which is one of the largest in Southeast Europe. There are 25 ski lifts with capacity of 32,000 skiers per hour. Soil erosion is a threat as there is a lot of logging and deforestation in the park, often illegal. Sky slopes also pose a threat due to soil erosion. Kopaonik has high biodiversity value and an abundance of plant and animal life with many species being autochtonous and endemic. In total, there are 1,600 plant species in the park, out of which 200 grow only on Kopaonik. It also includes over 200 species of fungi. Special value of Kopaonik in terms of biological diversity is that 11.9% of the high mountain endemic species in the Balkans inhabits the mountain. Kopaonik has 175 species of birds, including the protected ones.   The size of the area (km2) is 606. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 38.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 56.40%.   Next to being an important producer and exporter of raspberries, Serbia also produces and export a substantial volume of other berries such as blueberries, blackberries and aronia. These are sold fresh on the markets all around Serbia; exported; and further processed to be frozen or as james, jellies and fruit juices. The cultivation of these berries takes place all over Serbia. For instance, at present, total blueberry production is estimated to be more than 2,500ha. However, whereas raspberry production sites are of a relatively small size, blueberry production is made up of large, intensive farms with modern technologies. With young orchards coming to full capacity, Serbia s annual output is growing fast, and modern coldstorage sites can be seen all over the country. Cultivation of blueberry and black berries takes place on Kopaonik Mountain. From there, products are processed (cleaned, frozen, dried, stored, packeged) and sold on to the whole sale market eventually reaching consumer via retail (markets, supermarkets, restaurants, catering) and export. Serbia is the one biggest producers and exporters of blueberries, blackberries and aronija. Production and access to market show potential for growth. Considerable hurdles however exist that prevent these products from reaching their full potential. Cultivation and picking is very much connected to local mountain conditions and an important source for employment. Main challenges and threats are related to underutilised production capacity, lack of qualified staff, lack of effective marketing strategies, lack of investment opportunities and climate change.   Reasonably good soil and climate conditions. Strong local knowledge on how to cultivate and process the production.    Research has shown that processing companies are privately owned, on average underused their production capacities. It can be concluded that there is great distinction in capacity utilisation among the enterprises. The most common way of promotion is fairs and exhibitions, advertising using leaflets and brochures are rarer, and only a few enterprises promote products in magazines of healthy and organic food. But generally it can be concluded that companies promotion is unsatisfactory, because entrepreneurs do not have enough money to invest in this segment of business. Results showed that only half of entrepreneurs have a valid and legal standards and certificates for trade. Especially, the main opportunities of the enterprises are favourable locations, good distribution channels, and expansion of new products on new markets. Moreover, weaknesses are insufficient export orientation, lack of qualified staff, uneven cash flow and difficulties with payment. External factors negatively influencing business were unfair competition, undeveloped market and lack of favourable loans and subsidies. Other challenges are posed by the effects of climate change. The biggest challenges production of all fruits in Serbia due to climate change faces are drought, excessive rain and flash floods, late season frost and hail storms. Often these extreme weather events follow each other in short succession thereby exacerbating the problems. Water shortages pose serious problems for fruit growers. In addition, there are increased chances of pests due to invasive species. Measures such as early warning systems, hail rockets, hail nets and irrigation systems are applied to combat these hazards but require substantial investments. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The innovation potential lies with designing and implementing new marketing strategies, improving access to markets -both national and international- and investment in better storage and processing capacity in otder to make make better use of underused capacity at processing plants. Better marketing strategies and providing access to markets lead to better integration with EU and global markets. Innovation potential also lies with growing investments in hi-tech orchards, climate change adaptation measures and logistics infrastructure. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   (max 300 characters)."
