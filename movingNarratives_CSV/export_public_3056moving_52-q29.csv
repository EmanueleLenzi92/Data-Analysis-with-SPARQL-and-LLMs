Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 ES. It is the remaining redoubt of the wild bull or aurochs in the Basque Country. It is a semi-wild breed that moves in the mountains, where it feeds and breeds without human intervention. Males weigh around 400 to 500 kg. and females 350 kg. They are milk carcasses of 30 to 40 kgs obtained from calves of 3 to 5 months of life fed exclusively on mother's milk. Without any other type of feed. The mother's diet is based on natural fodder and does not accept feed with transgenic components or additives. The reproductive cycle is associated with the seasons, and they usually give birth to a calf every two years. It is estimated to produce 100 carcasses and 20 jerkies per year. The census in Navarra in 2016 was 603 heads located in 19 farms.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Pyrenees. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Goizueta. The historical production area is the Euskalherria mountains. Its peculiarities of great rusticity, together with its historical and traditional value in the Basque mountains, give this breed a special interest for the use of marginal and mountain areas.

The Betizu is a breed of small mountain cattle which live in a semi-feral state in some mountainous parts of the Basque Country in both Basque Country and France. It is classified as an endangered breed by both the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación of Spain and by the Conservatoire des Races d'Aquitaine in France. It is included in the Official Catalog of Basque Autochthonous Animal Breeds, the Official Catalog of Cattle Breeds of Spain, in the FAO Catalog of the United Nations (DAD-IS), as well as in the Ark of Taste Slow Food. Innovation is justified by new public systems and regulations to preserve native breeds, private initiatives by local entrepreneurs, and articulation with social movements that share these objectives.   The management of pastures and forests to ensure the continuity of this breed and its contribution to the sustainable management of ecosystems, fire prevention, and the generation of economic added value are interrelated aspects in this value chain.    The main challenge is the conservation of a breed that is in danger of extinction. This involves the availability of pastures and woodlands where this species can reproduce while at the same time intervening in the management of the agroforestry space and offering economic profitability. Entities such as the Asociación de Criadores de Betizu de Navarra- ASBENA are committed to this challenge. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is related to articulating a local response to a situation that threatens the breed's survival and connects with other international initiatives aimed at the defense of agricultural, livestock, and food biodiversity, such as the Slow Food movement. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   It is one of a small number of semi-feral cattle populations in Europe, with the Albera of the Pyrenees, the Monchina of Cantabria, and the Raço di Biòu of the Camargue. The Government of Navarre has launched a project to conserve this autochthonous breed. They own a herd that inhabits the abandoned village of Sastoya, in the Urraúl Alto."
