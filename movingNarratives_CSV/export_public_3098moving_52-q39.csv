Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The VC is present in all of the Swiss Alps, the MRL mentioned below was chosen because it corresponds most to the area we are working in."
