The term 'botillo,' translated as sausage, blood sausage, or chorizo, defines a product made from the pig's thick intestines in which various types of pork meat are stuffed. Its origin seems to be Roman, being the main gastronomic identity product of El Bierzo, under the Regulatory Council of the Protected Geographical Indication Botillo del Bierzo.   The essential ingredients of botillo are the ribs (minimum 65% and maximum 90%) and the pig's tail (minimum 10% and maximum 20%). At the manufacturers' discretion, other components such as tongue, cheek, shoulder, and backbone could be added to a maximum of 20% of the total, and no component of this rest can exceed half of this 20%. Salt, paprika, and garlic, authorized additives, and other natural spices are subsequently added to all the ingredients. The basic ingredients come from the production area and the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León.    The botillo has spread to regions bordering El Bierzo. The Regulatory Council of the PGI is responsible for controlling and certifying the production process following the rules established by the corresponding Regulations and Quality Manual. It is forbidden to use names, brands, terms, expressions, and signs that, due to their similarity, phonetic or graphic, with the protected ones, could lead to confusion.
