Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 SCA. Although there are hundreds of ways to brew the local traditional beer, they all share a common feature, the smoky taste. The general process is as follows. First the grains are soaked and cleaned. Afterwards they are spread on a growing frame and they are moved by hand several times per day to keep the heat evenly distributed among the grains. Four days after, the grains are dried in the traditional Sainna (a fire drier with wooden planks with holes on top of which the grains are spread). Here is where the grains get the smoky flavour. Finally, after around eight days of hand work with the grains, they are ready to be brewed. Up to 22 beer breweries can be found in this municipality and also few malthouses. In addition, there is an annual beer festival where most of those hundreds of small brewers participate and the best Stjørdalsøl brewer is crowned.

High quality product linked to an old tradition in the region. The innovation is related to the search for new markets beyond the locality, as this VC has traditionally been mostly focused at local scale. In addition, the Growling service is an innovation in the way this product is purchased.   There is a strong beer brewing tradition in the area. There are up to hundreds of small producers that brew their own beer in groups of friends or family just for their own enjoyment and consumption. Knowledge on the basic steps to make this smoked beer is shared among the brewers to maintain alive the tradition, but each of them keep their own recepies' secret, giving this way a great diversity to the local beers. Normally, they use local malt for the breweries and no hops. Instead they add juniper seeds to the water to give flavours from local forests.    Their key challenge is to get a niche in the market outside of the locality. Being an artisanal production, those who want to make a living with it need to improve their market position. They are already doing so by developing e-commerce and also joining regional associations of local producers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The product itself is very traditional. The artisanal making guarantees its uniqueness. However, there are some breweries that are developing their marketing strategies and setting e-commerce and websites. In addition, some are part of the local label AUK SMAKER FRA STJØRDALSFØRET, which also helps to reach new customers and to sell online. Besides, they offer the Growling, a service that allows customers to refill their bottles in the brewery. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Another example of small scale beer brewery exist in the municipality of Vinje (NO0834)."
