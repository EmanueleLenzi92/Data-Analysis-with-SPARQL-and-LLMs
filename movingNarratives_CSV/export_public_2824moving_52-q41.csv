The VC comprises of the activities of groups of local producers and their families and a local cooperative for standardization, packaging, promotion and marketing of a high reputation product.

The area of Kato Nevrokopi is a mountainous basin consisting of several villages in the Prefecture of Drama, Eastern Macedonia. The basin is at 550m with continental climate, with - unusual for Greece - low temperatures in winter. The microclimatic conditions of the area, the frequent changes in temperature as well as the slightly acidic and sandy soil, produce potatoes of special taste and flavor. The area is covered with snow for half a year, so there is no possibility for a double harvest, which is common in other areas, so the soil is not depleted. For more than 50 years the cultivation of potatoes prevails in the land use of Kato Nevrokopi. In the last decade the potatoes are cultivated with integrated management, have gained a PGI, high reputationa and territorial identity. Kato Nevrokopi potato is known throughout Greece for its superior taste and quality characteristics. Its cultivation appeared in the Kato Nevrokopi basin in the mid-1920s, and became dominant in the 60's while in 2002 it was recognized as a PGI product, due to the climate, the soil and the long experience of potato growers. The majority of the local farmers who cultivate potatoes, are heavily depentend on the product. That affects their income, their life conditions and their culture. The potatoes make possible the thriving of the community under very uncommon for Greece climatic conditions (very low temperatures in winter).   The soil and the harsh climate have made the potato cultivation the prevailing land use in Kato Nevrokopi, a basin surrounded by mountains. The potato cultivation is a single crop, supporting the local community and strengthening their bonds against the threats and the precariousness. The climate of the area is condinental and that affects the cultivation and the quality of potatoes. The climate change has brought more rain and less snow, which has started affecting the cultivation of potatoes. Additionally, there is extensive adulteration in potatoes, which intensifies market competition. The income of the local population depends heavbily on the potato production and on the consumption of potatoes in Greece. These factors create vulnerabilities and precuriousness for the local community of the area. During the last 5 years more than 5% of the potato producers have adandon this traditional cultivation. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. A local coopertaive of 50 farmers (out of the 300) has introduced new marketing practices for the potatoes, starting with logos. The innovation lies in the fact that farmers have decided to take extroversion actions in order to face the competition, to protect the product against adulteration and to highlight the uniqueness of the product. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and social. Similar VC, based on mountainous potatoes can be found in Lassithi plateau, in Crete (EL432)."
