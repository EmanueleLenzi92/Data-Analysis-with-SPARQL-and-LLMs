Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 FR. There are 20 dairies collecting milk of about 300 dairy farmers (mostly dairy-Ewe farmers, but also dairy-Goat farmers). Some of those farmers make their own chese two ('mixte producers'). DAiries and farmers interact at each dairy's level, but they have also interprofesionnels organization such as the PDO Brocciu. the 5 most important dairies, each one collecting 15 to 100 dairy producers, push farmers to produce more, even if they have to change to foreign breeds, or adopte more intensive feeding practices. The current production of dairy cheeses knows a disembedding process : it might be less intertwined with the local socioecological system, that is local population on one hand, natural resources on the other hand. A large part of dairies complement their local collect of milk with pruchase of foreign milk, coming from the French Continent or Sardinia.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. Corsica is an island in the sea. It presents a great diversity of landscapes: plains, hillsides, deap and steep valleys Small ruminant farming has long been a transhumant activity, occupying all the region. For the past decades, farmers have settled, in the plains and hillsides. Some of them keep on using mountain pastures during Summer. They are scattered within the region, with no remarkable specialised sub-region. Dairies are mainly located in plains but they collect milk from farmers all around Corsica, some of whom process a part of their production as well.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12.   The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.60%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 80.20%.   high reputation products, coexistence between mountainous area and plains, legitimacy to produce between dairies and on-farm cheese makers, competing access to milk, strategy of localisation and contribution to villages vividness, resources linked to pastoral breeding (breeds, feeding species) and their associated know-how are diminushing.   to (re)assemble resources that have been built and transmitted in the territory (breeds, feeding species.. ) and to be able to address the issues raisen by the agroecological transition. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Tradiotional and Innovative.   Dairies have been created in the 1980ies. These are mostly family businesses, they used to mature cheese or to make it from their own herd's milk and they decided to expand.Dairies produce a large range of cheeses, mostly embedding into local typicality. They are of different sizes and know standardization with various intensity.The most important ones are located in the Corsican plains, some of them are in the hill-sides. They collect farmers'milk everywhere in the region but most of the volume is produced in the plains. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Dairy husbandry and production of Cheese is observable in every other MRLs (Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland). Recognition of GIs and coexistence between artisanal and industrial production are also a common features of those areas. Dairies might not be located within the mountainous areas, but they can collect milk there and so have an influence on the matching SES."
