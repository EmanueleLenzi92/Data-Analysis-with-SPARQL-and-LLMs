Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 AT. The cooperative provides an income basis for the mountain farmers which is also of importance regarding the multifunctionality of the mountain landscape, which has value for tourism and also for the identity (organic products from the region). At the same time there is an investment in the development of new products as well as the cultivation of unusual crops in regard to mountain regions (unusual regards the economic feasibility). Premium products are used to cross-finance less profitable products. The supermarket chain M-Preis is an exclusive partner for the marketing of the products of BioAlpin and has also an important role for the product development. All in all this VC helps to increase the resilience of the farmers and the associated SES.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps.

Bio vom Berg is a Tyrolian brand owned by a cooperative (BioAlpin e.G.) of about 600 farmers and small-scale food processors (bakery, alpine dairy). The aim of the cooperative is to support small farmers and mountain farmers to run their farms in an economically decent way as well as to support organic farming and thus help to sustain the cultural landscape. Besides traditional products they provide premium products and products that are not typical to be produced in mountain regions. They have a close cooperation with the regional supermarket chain M-Preis. The aim of the cooperative is to support small farmers and mountain farmers to run their farms in an economically decent way as well as to support organic farming and thus help to sustain the cultural landscape. The farmers try to provide a complementary set of products in order to avoid over production and therefore decreases in prices. Another aim of these efforts is to increase the diversity of products. Revenue from premium products (like different sorts of cheese) are invested in the development of new products (such as beer) and in the development of for mountain regions untypical and unprofitable products (such as grain). They have a close partnership at eye level with the Tyrolian supermarket chain M-Preis that also invest in product development of BioAlpin.   On the one side the cooperative BioAlpin helps that farmers from the cooperative having a better income and improved marketing options. On the other side the landscape and the small size of mountain farms is an important asset for BioAlpin to promote regional, organic products in Tyrol. The cooperation among farmers as well as the cooperation with M-Preis at eye-level allows knowledge transfer and innovation. Traditional knowledge as well as innovation plays a crucial role for BioAlpin.    Mountain farmers struggle having enough income for their produce the cooperative gives them a structure for a better marketing and income. Climate change is a challenge for vegetable/fruit farmers in regard the increasing heat (and heat waves) and thus for irrigation. For pasture farms climate change regards mostly biodiversity and is a logistically challenge because of the prolongation of the summer grazing period. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Bio vom Berg exists since 2002 as a brand of the BioAlpin cooperative. This cooperative allows democratic decision making, coordination of the production and the development of new products in order to secure the income of the farmers. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is of special interest because of it s actors structure and governance of these structure. However, it doesn t meet the criteria in regard to the mountain landscapes system. That s why data in section 3 are provided at NUTS-2 level, since this VC also extends the boundaries of a NUTS-3 region. Interactions (positive and negative impact) with the SES are thus provided as general information."
