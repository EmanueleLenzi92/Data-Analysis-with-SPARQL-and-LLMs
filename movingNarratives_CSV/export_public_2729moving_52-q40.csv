Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 AT. The value chain includes 4 bee product producing farmers, who market their products either via direct sale (on farm) or through regional partners (shops and gastronomy). They offer educational programmes and vocational trainings, and cooperate with the Austrian apitherapy association.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Weiz (No: 617). The region Almenland (transl.: Styrian alpine pasture region) is one of the biggest connected pasture-regions in Europe (total 125 pastures, 36,6 km2).

The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.68%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21444. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8141. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 11.77%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.50%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.73%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 4310. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.77%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4555. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 30. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 58.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   A group of innovative beekeepers (4 farms - ca. 1.200m) from the Almenland region has set itself the goal of not only producing alpine honey of special quality, but also a variety of other high quality products, such as chocolates, mead, and various products with propolis, wax. Numerous awards confirm their quality work. Morover they offer educational programmes and beekeeping seminars, and they have set up cooperations with medical experts for apitherapy. The VC is of particular interest as it is focussing with a product that is essentially produced in many other places in Austria (and elsewhere) on the particular value of being produced in a mountainous area. Moreover, the diversification in terms of offering a broad range of products, as well as linking with the medical sector (even engaging in related studies), and cooperations with the local tourism in the context of educational programmes and for selling their products makes this initiative interesting.   * close connection with regional development: contributing to the 'Genussregion Almenland ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria)) marketed under a common brand * educational programmes and professional trainings enrich the touristic offers.    Beekeepers and their bees are very closely linked to local weather conditions, thus highly sensitive to climate change issues. Especially in winter, fluctuating temperatures disturb the hibernation of the bees. As soon as the thermometer rises above 10 C, the first bees fly off, but usually cannot find any flowers. If they even keep brood due to longer warm periods in the winter months, this weakens the colonies even more, because they can only generate the necessary brood nest temperature of approx. 35 C by consuming their food supplies. As soon as it gets cold again, the temperature fluctuations demand enormous heating power. That costs the people unnecessary energy. In mild winters, the bees also breed all year round. This favors the development and multiplication of the Varroa mite, because it then also multiplies in the brood cells together with the bee brood in winter. Several, ever-growing generations of Varroa mites can also arise in this way. Most beekeepers do not take notice of this situation in spring because their bee colonies multiply rapidly during this time. The rude awakening follows after the summer solstice. From this point on, the bees reduce their colony size in order to get through the winter as a smaller colony. The varroa multiplication, which takes place up to the summer solstice, then kills bee colonies in summer. There have also been indications for years that a change in temperature in spring disrupts the fine coordination between the pollinator insects and the plants to be pollinated. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. specific quality: In the Almenland Nature Park there are almost no intensively cultivated fields and fruit crops, thus no pesticides are used. Therefore, no spray residues can get into the honey. In addition, the wide range of different herbs and medicinal plants, offers the bees the opportunity to produce honey with special active ingredients. Medical applications of bee products: cooperation with well-known apitherapy experts, who use bees' products in their practice (honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax and bee venom). Engagement in apitherapy professional events. Certified bee mental training offered. Educational programs and bee trails in cooperation with the touristic sector. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and new cooperations (apitherapy). The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   In 2019, there were 30.237 registered beekeepers with 390,607 bee colonies in Austria, and around 4,000 tons of honey were produced in Austria. This refers to a degree of self-sufficiency of 46% (highest per capita honey consumption in the EU is in Germany and Austria). As is typical for Austrian agriculture in general, the beekeeping sector is structured on a small scale. The beekeepers cultivate an average of 13 colonies. There are only a few professional beekeepers in Austria (approx. 1.5%), but they manage 20% of the bee colonies. The focus of Austrian beekeeping is in the federal states of Styria (where the VC described in this card is located as well), Upper Austria and Lower Austria. Almost 60% of Austria's beekeeping businesses are based there."
