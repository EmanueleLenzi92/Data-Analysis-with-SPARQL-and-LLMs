Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 SER. Local pickers, purchasing stations, processors, whole sale, retail and end consumers (markets, supermarkets, restaurants, health shops). Under used potential has lead to the need to supplement local production with imports from Ukraine, Poland and other countries. Most producers/processors adhere to at least one quality scheme such as the HACCP standard.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Kopaonik Mountain, Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is unspecified. Kopaonik Mountain Western Serbia, Dinaric Arc. The highest point is the Pančić's Peak with 2,017 m. In 1981, due to its location, climate, rich forests, variety of herbs, and area for holiday and recreation, 121.06 km2 of the range were proclaimed a national park. Stretching for 75 km in the north-south direction, between the rivers of Lab and Sitnica on the south and Jošanica on the north, Kopaonik is one of the largest and longest mountains in Serbia. It belongs to the administrative region of Raška. The Kopaonik mountain massif includes the mountains of Kopaonik, Željin, Goč and Stolovi. The Pančić's Peak, with 2,017 m is the highest point of the mountain. Kopaonik has a continental climate with fresh summers, and long, cold winters with abundant snowfall. The snow season lasts from November to April, while there are around 200 sunny days. On the slopes of Kopaonik there is Kopaonik ski resort which is one of the largest in Southeast Europe. There are 25 ski lifts with capacity of 32,000 skiers per hour. Soil erosion is a threat as there is a lot of logging and deforestation in the park, often illegal. Sky slopes also pose a threat due to soil erosion. Kopaonik has high biodiversity value and an abundance of plant and animal life with many species being autochtonous and endemic. In total, there are 1,600 plant species in the park, out of which 200 grow only on Kopaonik. It also includes over 200 species of fungi. Special value of Kopaonik in terms of biological diversity is that 11.9% of the high mountain endemic species in the Balkans inhabits the mountain. Kopaonik has 175 species of birds, including the protected ones.   The size of the area (km2) is 606. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 56.40%.   In Serbia, wild mushroom picking is an age old tradition. Most of it is collected to be sold on and processed further down the VC which is longer and more complicated than that of berries. People also pick them however for their own consumption. Permits were issued for the mushrooms boletus (Boletus edulis), chanterelle (Cantharellu scibarius), black trumpet (Cantharellus cornucopioides), milk cup (Lactarius delicious), scotch bonnet (Marasmius oreades) and black summer truffle (Tuber aestivum). Yields especially for chanterelles have shown a steady increase over the years. Overall the growth in trade of fresh mush-rooms increased by 65% per annum. Amounts of picked mushrooms in Serbia are similar to Poland at approx. 8.2 kg/ha. However, the permitted volume is higher than actual production for mushrooms, because of the circumstances which are not of an economically character, such as environmental factors. End consumers are markets, supermarkets, health shops, restaurants and pharmacies. Export product. This is an under utilised VC. There is room for growth in production. New marketing strategies could help to position the mushroom to more nature and health aware niche consumer market segments with a specific notation that these are mushrooms from Kopaonik mountain. The VC faces potential threats from CC, mostly notely drought so awereness and adaptation measures should be directed to protecting this VC from that perspective.   Local pickers (65% of local pickers pick to sell the mushroom to the purchasing stations; the other 35% pick for own consumption). Local purchasing stations that sell on to processors further down the VC. This product is very much dependent on ecological and environmental conditions (soil quality, climate, shady conditions, etc.).    Underused capacity mostly due environmental factors such as the impacts of climate change, mostly drought. Complicated VC. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. There is not much innovation. There is however potential to increase production and to come up with new marketing strategies to market this product to consumers who appreciate natural values, health and high quality food. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This is a long and complicated VC which covers also other MLR. To serve the national and international market, produce from other MLR are also purchased and processed."
