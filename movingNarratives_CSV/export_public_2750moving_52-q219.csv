Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 15 BG. Beekeeping has always been a common activity in the Strandzha region and the design of the bee skeps (baskets) and stumps used in the region today date from the end of the 19th century. The honey is collected during the months of June, July and August when the bees are foraging on the thick, sweet juice called 'honeydew' ('manna') that is emitted from the leaves of the oak trees under the very specific climatic conditions of the Strandzha massif. Strandzhanski manov med has been registered as a PDO since April 2019. It has a very specific reddish colour, thick consistency and slight acidity bitter taste. Most honey is sold locally, but there are significant sales throughout Bulgaria (including by online sales / mail order) - plus demand from abroad. Other therapeutic bee products are also made by the same bee-keepers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Strandzha Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Tsarevo Municipality in Burgas Province (BG341). Burgas Province (BG341) lies in south-east Bulgaria against the Black Sea coast and is the largest province in the country. The Strandzha mountains are in the south of the province on the border with and rise to an altitude of around 1,000 metres. The Strandzha Nature Park lies within the mountain massif and is the largest protected area in Bulgaria spanning a territory of 1,161 square kilometres and including five nature reserves and 14 other protected areas. The relief of the Strandzha mountains is characterised by mild rolling ridges covered with dense woods. To the west the mountain slopes are steeper and more rugged.   The size of the area (km2) is 513.4. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 9.014. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 17.56. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 52.50. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.06%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 6400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2293. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 24.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.50%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 6500. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 5872. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 41.00%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 54.10%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 103875. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 93.90%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 16170. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 18.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 21.50%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 59.80%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 22.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 28.90%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 49.10%.   Many different types of mountain honey are produced in Bulgaria depending upon the season and the vegetation that is flowering, but one of the most famous is the dark brown 'manna honey' produced in the Strandzha mountains in south-east Bulgaria. Tsarevo Municipality (BGS13) in Burgas Province (BG341) is one of the centres of production of this speciality honey.   The very specific natural asset used to produce Strandzhanski manov med (Manna honey) is the Natura 2000 designated oak forests of the Strandzha mountains in the south of Burgas Province. Due to their proximity to the Black, Marmara and Aegean Seas, the Strandzha mountains have relatively high air humidity and mild temperatures which, combined with the local soil conditions, creates a very specific flora in the oak forests.    As in most other countries, there is growing concern amongst Bulgarian bee-keepers about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources. The long-term effects of climate change and climate variability remain unknown but are likely to have negative impacts upon productivity of honeybees. Specific interventions are therefore needed to strengthen the capacity of beekeepers to adapt e.g. by integrating climate services with available indigenous knowledge and local practices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural.   Bulgaria has adopted conditions and procedures for use of the optional quality term (OQT) 'Mountain Product' and a national logo has been approved. However uptake of the OQT is currently very low."
