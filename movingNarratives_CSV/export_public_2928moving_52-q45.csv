Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is PORTUGAL ESTRELA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 PT2. Rye is cultivated in the mountain area and, after harvesting, it is transformed into flour in the water mills that still in operation in the region. The rye flour is then used to produce the Rye Bread. Nowadays, there are small bakeries with wood ovens where the Rye Bread is cooked, imitating the community wood ovens of the past.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cordilheira Central (RR08). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Manteigas. With stunning landscapes, Manteigas is a municipality with 4 parishes, in the district of Guarda in the Centre region of Portugal. Manteigas shares with the municipalities of Seia and Covilhã, the highest point in mainland Portugal at 1993 meters of altitude. The main village of Manteigas is located in the Zêzere Glacier Valley, which is a great example of landscape modeling by glaciers, with its 'U' shape.

Rye was traditionally used to produce bread because it is more resistant than other cereal crops to the conditions of the mountain region, where the soils are poorer and thinner and the winter is very cold. Product highly characteristic of the MRL. Product highly connected to land use and landscape management.   Rye is a cereal grain used for flour and bread that grows well in poor soils and under very low temperatures.    Is land abandonment an issue to this value chain? Local production on Rye is diminishing. Can this VC be maintained or will Rye Bread production depend more and more on imported cereals?. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include N/A.   This product may be produced in different municipalities at Serra da Estrela."
