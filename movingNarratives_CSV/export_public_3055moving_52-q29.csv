Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 ES. The breed has its origin in the Pyrenean stock, whose ancestral representative is the capra aegagrus. The main productive use is meat. The suckling goats are slaughtered at around 35 to 40 days after birth, having drunk only their mother's milk. They reach about 10 to 11 kg live weight which becomes 7 to 8 kg carcass weight. The carcasses are left for 3 to 4 days in airing until they are ready to be cooked. The 'caprino mayor' (from cull goats, which is usually consumed in rural areas and was once used for canning) is also consumed. Owners are family farms, generally small in size (20-30 goats). Farms with more than 50 goats are rare and farms with 100 or more goats are exceptional.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cantabrian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Orozko. The Parque Natural de Gorbeia is a natural park in the autonomous community of the Basque Country in northern Spain.

The Azpi Gorri is a traditional breed of the Basque Country. By the late twentieth century it had become gravely endangered, with an estimated breeding population of 100. In 1997 it was added to the Catálogo Oficial de Razas de Ganado de España, the national register of livestock breeds of the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación, and in 2001 it was included in the official list of Basque breeds of the País Vasco. A breed society, the Euskal Herriko Azpi Gorri Elkartea, was formed in 1999; it has kept the herd-book since 2007. Innovation is justified by new public systems and regulations to preserve native breeds, private initiatives by local entrepreneurs, and articulation with social movements that share these objectives.   These animals have a dual aptitude for milk and meat, although there is a marked tendency to sell live kids. They graze freely in the mountains with little human intervention. They like aromatic and medicinal plants. The Azpi Gorri goats follow a regime of extensive exploitation. After April, the herd is sent to the mountains, where the animals live in complete freedom during the 5-6 months of their stay.    The main challenge is the conservation of the breed as it is in a serious process of recession. It is recognized as a native breed in the Basque Country and the Spanish state, as well as by the FAO, and is included in the Slow Food Ark of Taste. The Bizkaiko Azpi Gorri Elkartea (BIAGE) brings together Biscayan Azpi Gorri goat breeders. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is related to articulating a local response to a situation that threatens the breed's survival and connects with other international initiatives aimed at the defense of agricultural, livestock, and food biodiversity, such as the Slow Food movement. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   It is distributed in the northern part of the province of Álava and in southern Bizkaia, with a few herds in the autonomous community of Navarre."
