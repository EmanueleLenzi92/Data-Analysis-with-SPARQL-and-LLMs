Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 FR1. Conventional agriculture in irrigated field crops is characteristic of Drôme down valley. The main productions are: wheat, corn, garlic, sunflower,seeds, chickpeas, aromatic plants..This value chain is facing strong pressures: water scarcity, drought, parasitism, installation of new diversified farms, implying a new balance in water sharing. Actors of this VC are developping adaptation and transformation strategies for irrigated field crops in the face of climate change: Diversification strategies; Rationalization of irrigation, especially for high value crops and Crop rotation strategies. A renewed network of cooperation around water resource is also in development. Besides, due to climatic change, specific cultures from high and middle mountain areas tend to be developed in large fields in the down valley. It is thus interesting to study this phenomenon and its economic and ecological impact on the territory.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Drome Valley. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Drome departement. Drôme is a very diversified departement in terms of geological, natural and agricultural resources. The North-East of the territory is characterised by middle and high mountains (Pre Alps and Vercors Natural Park): agriculture is this area is mainly livestock and small diversified gardening. The South is characterized by the beginning of the Provence and the mediterranean climate, we can find there aromatic and yard large cultures. The West of the territory is characterized by plains were the Rhône and the Drôme rivers meet. Agriculture ther is mainly large cropland. Within the Drôme departement, Biovallée territority gathers 3 associations of municipalities (EPCI) - 95 muncipalities in total. It is a very preserved and diversified territory, following the Drôme River, from Pre Alps to large plains of the downvalley.   The size of the area (km2) is 2200. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 50. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2453. The total population (in thousand) is 58.56. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.3. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.6%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21100. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 14532.49. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.70%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 20.30%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 77.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 32799. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 242040. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.00%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 24.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 74.30%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 56167. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 37%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 6400. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 115. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 24.60%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 71.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.10%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.80%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.10%.   Conventional agriculture in irrigated field crops is the main agricultural pattern of Drome downvalley. Main productions are: wheat, corn, garlic, sunflower, chickpeas, aromatic plants, seeds, which are mainly drived towards animal food or long chain distribution. New products thank to diversification strategies: chickpeas, lentil New processes: irrigation dedicated only for high added value culture, crop rotation organic matter inputs, green fertilizers, reservoir New governance systems: cooperation between irrigators, new farmers, water management associations, local authorities.   Local employment, production of local value, answering actual and future territorial food demand (if adaptation strategie). Social asset: cooperation, community interactions around water use between farmers, local authorities, local water management associations, environment protection associations.    This value chain is facing strong pressures: water scarcity and pressure on sharing with new actors, drought, parasitism. The interest is to study adaptation and water sharing strategies implemented by irrigated field crops in the face of climate change (Diversification strategies, Rationalization of irrigation, especially for high value crops, Crop rotation strategies). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. This VC implements adaptation or transformation strategies anticipating climate change and water scarcity such as diversification and developement of adapted high added value cultures (chickpeas, lentil, aromatic), crops rotation, increase of organic matter inputs in soils, use of green fertilizers for carbon stockage and soil protection. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Social and economic.   The question of water scarcity in the Drome Valley is pregnant. Farmers irrigation system are connected to the river. Water puncture in the river, namely in low water period are problematic. It questions the shared use and protection of the river. Adaption by conventional irrigated culture actors of the Drome Valley is innovative at a national scale."
