Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 AT. The 'Lungauer Saatzucht- und Saatbauverein' markets two thirds of the edibles via food retailers and Salzburg Lagerhaus (a cooperative of RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG that sells agricultural goods, building materials, construction and garden commodities). The rest is marketed directly by the members of the association. Also this association is important for the breeding and reproduction of the potato. The high cost of potato cultivation together with poor prices have caused the area under cultivation in the region to fall from 366 hectares in 1959 to 150 hectares in 2000. The Genussregion is thus of importance for the marketing. The Lungauer Eachtling is a quality product that is also sold in supermarkets. At present, about 150 hectares of potatoes are planted by 400 farmers, of which the Lungauer Saatzucht- und Saatbauverein manages about 40 hectares (representing 28 farmers). Around 60 percent of the acreage is cultivated according to organic standards. The harvest is used as seed potatoes (40 %), food potatoes (40 %) and fodder potatoes (20 %).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Tamsweg (No: 505 = NUTS 3: AT321: Lungau). The Lungau region is congruent with the district of Tamsweg in the southeast of the province of Salzburg, Austria. The Lungau in Salzburg is an inner alpine basin at over 1,000 meters above sea level, delimited by mountain ranges that influence the harsh climate and vegetation quite decisively. The region is also known as the 'Austrian cold pole'. The region is particularly sheltered from the wind and low in precipitation due to the surrounding mountains. The natural, humus-rich, sandy soils (primary rock weathered soils) found in the region are particularly well suited for potato cultivation. Optimal climate and soil conditions make the Lungau a potato health area with low pest pressure.   The size of the area (km2) is 1019.65. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 20.251. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 19.86. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -2.77%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 78.05. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.78%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 20216. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 698. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.01%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 26.07%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.92%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 20428. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 25710. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.82%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 24.58%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 74.61%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 16955. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 5.78%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1079. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 96. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 10.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 26.53%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 63.27%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.38%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 19.77%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.85%.   Lungauer Eachtlinge ( Eachtling is a dialect word from Salzburg for potato ) are produced in the central Alps of Austria in the federal state of Salzburg, where the potato grow very well. Lungauer Eachtling is regarded as traditional Austrian food. Different potato varieties have been cultivated there since the end of the 18th century. Since 2005 this VC is embedded in a 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). The Lungauer Eachtling is marketed as quality product which is connected to the Austrian quality food initiative Genussregion . Most producers are organic farmers. Transparency is also very important: The origin of Lungauer Eachtling must be traceable from the field to the retailer. To this end, every farmer is required to keep records of which potato varieties were grown on which areas and when they were harvested according to variety. In food retailing, the packaged goods are labelled with the name and address of the agricultural producer, variety, method of production (organic or conventional), quantity, delivery date, cooking type, and address of the seed growers' association.   The Lungauer Saatzucht- und Saatbauverein is the most important actor in this VC, because the association has been the bearer of traditional knowledge that is used to cultivate and breed the (different) potato (varieties). The 'isolated' location of the region is advantageous for potato cultivation (e.g., lower incidence of rot diseases).    Due to the alpine climate conditions and the altitude of the cultivated areas at over 1,000 meters above sea level, the yields per hectare are rather modest. Therefore the Genussregion and niche markets are very important for the potato farmers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The Lungauer Eachtling is marketed as a quality product because the region allows for appropriately qualitative products, but large quantities cannot be produced. The work of the Lungauer Saatzucht- und Saatbauverein, which initiated the Genussregion, is highly relevant. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The cultivation of potatoes for the mass markets happens in the flat lands in Eastern and Southern Austria. There are few other mountain regions where the potato is cultivated and marketed as quality products (also in supermarkets) such as Murbodner Erdäpfel (see other VC AT11)."
