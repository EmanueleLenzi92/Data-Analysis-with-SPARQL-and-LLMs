Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 RO. The Dulceață made in the Valea Doftanei commune is an artisanal product manufactured on a small-scale by a single household business. All ingredients are grown or hand-picked locally according to the season. The Dulceață is sold in small 200 - 350 gramme jars that are labelled in full accordance with national legislation, including prominent display of the 'Mountain Product' logo. Sales of the Dulceață are the primary source of household income for the producer and also contribute positively to the local village economy.

A traditional homemade 'jam' made from various fruits, flowers and vegetables. Production is commonly small-scale (artisanal), but some larger-scale commercial processing may also be found. Very popular and very diverse. There are three types of Dulceață (Sweet Chilli, Elderberry and Raspberry) produced in the Valea Doftanei commune (136107) in Prahova County that are registered as 'Mountain Products' under Romania's adoption of the Optional Quality Term (OQT) - see below.   Cultivated fruits (and some vegetables), plus wild collected flowers and berries are the main natural assets. The traditional recipes, knowledge and techniques that are used to make the Dulceață can also be considered as cultural assets.    Value chains for artisanal products such as the Dulceață produced in the Valea Doftanei commune are vulnerable since they command a premium price and there are many lower quality / 'counterfeit' products on the market that undermine their sales. Registration as a 'Mountain Product' helps greatly to promote the product and ensure consumer confidence, but such products still rely heavily upon direct sales which can be interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the producers (e.g. covid). This vulnerability could be overcome to a great extent by inclusion into better established value chains (e.g. there are now many supermarkets in Romania with sections selling local products), but this also brings additional challenges for small-scale businesses. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Romania has been one of the most active Member States in developing and adopting the Optional Quality Term (OQT) for products from its mountain areas. It is also currently the only country that has decided not to use any derogation for the registration of 'Mountain Products' - thereby strictly requiring that products originate from within a designated mountain area (reducing the distance to 0km). The National Mountain Area Agency (part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) has overall responsibility for co-ordination of the OQT, including maintenance of the National Registry of Mountain Products (https://produse.produsmontan.ro/). Processing and approval of requests to use the OQT and associated 'Mountain products' logo is undertaken locally by 30 Mountain Development Offices located in mountain communes. The National Consumers Protection Authority is responsible for regulating the market in 'Mountain Products' and checks if producers have been granted the authorisation to use the OQT and if the labelling is in compliance with the national regulation."
