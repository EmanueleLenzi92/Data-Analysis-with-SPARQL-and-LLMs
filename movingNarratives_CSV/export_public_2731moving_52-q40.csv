Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 AT. The initiative links various key actors from tourism, the wood sector (production and processing), farms, companies from the sector of renewable energy, but also educational institutions. Lots of different activities are implemented, such as e.g.: wood as primary product for the (green) building sector (label ReinHolz ) Construction of the biomass farm and logistics center Naturwärme St. Lambrecht. Construction of many small hydropower plants (stock 45: 150,000 MWh). Regional electricity generation supplies a surplus in the summer months. solar energy: equipping 50% of all buildings in the Murau district with solar or photovoltaic systems. Cooperation between plumber enterprises and regional energy producers Cooperation and networking of organic farmers for the production and processing of organic products joint regional marketing for organic products in cooperation with gastronomy, trade and tourism.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Murau (No: 614). The district of Murau is a peripheral region in the center of Austria north to Carinthia and east to the Lungau (a NUTS3 region in Salzburg, see VC of Lungauer Eachtlinge therefore next to the cold pole of Austria). The region can be considered as (very) peripheral (main roads are far away; the high-level rail link on the edge of the district will be lost in the next few years due to a new route). The river Mur (after which the region is named) flows through the main valley. The district of Murau is enclosed by the Niedere Tauern mountains in the north, the Seetaler Alps in the east and the Gurktaler Alps in the south and west. The lowest place is at an altitude of 650 m above sea level and the highest place 1,763 m above sea level. The highest elevation is at 2,740 m. The district of Murau is one of the most densely wooded areas in Styria, thus wood in general play a major role economically and thematically. The district has the largest closed stand of Swiss stone pines in Central Europe. The district also has an relatively small-scale industrial structure and has been scoring increasingly in the field of tourism for years.   The size of the area (km2) is 1385.4. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 650. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2740. The total population (in thousand) is 27.543. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 19.88. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.15%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.28. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.30%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21614.5. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2877. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.48%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 39.66%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 55.86%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21539. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 43050. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.84%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 35.12%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.04%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 12940. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 8.32%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1613. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 82. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 7.87%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 62.50%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 26.47%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 67.99%.   The Holzwelt Murau was founded as an association for regional development, which links hotels, restaurants and other touristic businesses from the region with businesses in wood construction, carpentry, and wood based energy production. The association aims to promote, as well as the economic, ecological and social development of the district or region of Murau. By means of a joint brand many companies, initiatives, organizations and public bodies should be recognizable in their corporate design as part of a region. The raw material wood serves as the most important resource in the Murau district. Another important economic pillar is tourism (especially winter). In addition, the region is characterized by a very high proportion of alternative forms of energy (biomass, water power, solar systems, wind power). The combination of these two aspects as main pillar of a regional development strategy going along with a regional brand and awareness raising measures is linking various actors, which is an interesting perspective.   The initiative addresses the economically most relevant sectors in the region; wood is an important additional income source for food producing farmers in mountainous areas. Accompanying awareness-raising measures are not only supposed to strengthen a positive perception of the Holzwelt Murau initiative within the region, but also to raise awareness for climate change related issues. The initiative also implies sustainable mobility: The Murtal train is powered by regional green electricity, which is to be the driving force behind the Austrian flagship region for sustainable mobility in rural areas.    Changing climatic conditions are increasingly affecting the forest. Necessary sensible adjustments to forest management must be designed for a very long-term period and take into account scenarios of climate developments. Although forestry has a relatively high adaptability compared to other sectors, the implementation of individual measures is time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the results often only show up after many years. The forest is not only affected by climate change, it also plays a key role in adapting to it and for climate protection. Consequently, wood based businesses are on the one hand at risk due to climate change, on the other hand they offer solutions as well. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The actor constellation is interesting as it links the economically most important sectors within the Region and fosters the interface between them. Building on the Murau energy vision, the implementation and steering-related structure of an energy competence center for renewable energy sources is being developed and reinforced by the climate and energy forum. The integration and joint organization of all energy-related activities relating to the climate and energy model region Holzwelt Murau is the main goal of the energy competence center. Municipalities and large companies act as role models for the region. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   There are similar initiatives within other Energy Model Regions in other mountainous regions as well (e.g. Almenland)."
