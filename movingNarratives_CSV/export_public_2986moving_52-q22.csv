Scottish breakfasts (mainly served in tourist cafes and accomodation i.e. BandBs) always contain at least one type of 'pudding' based on oatmeal, barley, beef fat and beef or sheep offal, traditionally served in a sheeps' stomach. They are often associated with remote rural agricultural areas and regions. Haggis, especially, has cultural connections to territorial identity, being frequently eaten across Scotland (and beyond) within a 'Burns Supper' to celebrate Scottish poet Robbie Burns. Black pudding from Stornoway (Western Isles LAU1) has PGI status. Such puddings need to be made on the Isle of Lewis to a specific recipe. Charles MacLeod (original producers of Stornoway Black pudding) has won multiple awards including six Great Taste Awards.   Natural assets: relies on land use for livestock farming, also landscape/ scenery to link to tourism ventures (i.e. scottish breakfast puddings often served in tourist accomodation). Social assets: strong links throughout the VC including between farmer/crofter, butcher and touism provider. Cultural assets: Links to traditional knowledge for pudding production, but also crofting and livestock farming practices. Haggis and black pudding are also important cultural icons for Scottish food industry.    relies on tourism for a good market for selling produce (potential challenges from BREXIT/ COVID). Relies on good relations across the VC (i.e. farmers, pudding producers, tourism ventures, tourists). Relies on maintaining land use/ climate so it can be suitable for livestock farming - potential imapcts from climate change may alter this. Only Stornoway black pudding has PGI status, other pudding may be at risk from 'imposters'. Black pudding is also made in Lancaster LAU1. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. traditional as have been created and sold in these areas for many years. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Haggis and other breakfast puddings are made throughout Scotland, includuing in non-upland areas, however, Stornoway Black pudding is the only one with PGI status. In Badenoch and Strathspey, Speyside specialities produce puddings, and others are produced in Edinburgh or even England (Lancaster LAU1) within Scottish branding for teh supermarket chain, Aldi. Breakfast puddings are important for both within-Scotland market and as an export market."
