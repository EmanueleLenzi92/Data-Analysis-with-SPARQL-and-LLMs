Everything takes places on a specific area of Apennines mountain range, from the growing of animal fodder to the breeding of the cows that produce the milk used to make the cheese. The meadows are self regenerating fields, because they have not been plowed, in same cases, not even centuries. They protected the land and are a place of biodiversity, yielding up more than 60 different fodder types that are the key aspect for the cheese quality.
