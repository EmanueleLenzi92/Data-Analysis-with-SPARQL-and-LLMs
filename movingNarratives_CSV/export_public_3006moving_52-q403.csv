Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 SER. Main activities are different types of tours and touristic offers created by the Adventure Network, including outdoor festivals, hiking tours, sky running, yoga retreats, free climbing, mountain biking, bird watching, introduction to the flora and fauna of the area, interaction with other similar organisations and individuals in order to create special programmes for individuals, families and groups. Low footprint of all activities, interaction with local food producers, rural tourism, cultural and historical assets is main objective. Most of the activities are advertised online and through social media, using personal recommendation about experiences as one of the main marketing tool. Positive impact on local population, offering channels for on-farm selling, or through rural tourism. Initiative is also connecting with other similar initiatives in other regions, creating network of people who care about nature, in the same time defining and organising unique experiences for the ones who want to live in harmony with nature.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia - Stara planina (Old mountain) / Rodophy mountains,. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Old Mountain (Stara planina). Stara Planina is located in eastern Serbia, on the border with Bulgaria, and is part of the vast Balkans. As a morphological unit, it is bordered by the valleys of Beli and Trgoviški Timok, and Visočica, and in the east by the state border.This nature park is a treasury of sediments of different ages, from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic, documented faunistically and floristically, which is why the profiles or entire zones that represent the geoheritage of universal value have been singled out. The relief of the area is extremely morpho-hydrologically intersected, and numerous mountain streams enrich the landscape features. The presence of about 1,190 plant species has been determined on Stara Planina, which makes up 34% of the total flora of Serbia. In addition, it is one of the most important centers of tertiary and glacial endemic relict species. Numerous groups of animals that enrich and beautify this mountain are also represented. The research identified 116 species of diurnal butterflies, 18 species of amphibians and reptiles, 203 species of birds and more than 30 species of mammals. Stara Planina is, for example, the main habitat of red buzzard (Buteo rufinus) and field woodpecker (Alauda arvensis) in Serbia, the main habitat of forest snipe (Scolopax rusticola) in eastern Serbia and the habitat of the endemic Balkan subspecies of woodpecker (Eremophila alpestris balcanica). The peculiarity of the area is reflected in the exceptional richness of cultural and historical monuments dating from the pre-Christian period to the 19th century, among which numerous Serbian Orthodox churches stand out for their beauty.   The size of the area (km2) is 1232. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 368. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2169. The total population (in thousand) is 53.82.

Adventure Network is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of adventure and rural development in (SE) Serbia, primarily in the Pirot district. They create programmes for individual and family activities that are based on sustainability, responsible travel and interaction with local people, food and culture. They create content to improve the quality of life and strengthen the adventure community in some of the most beautiful parts of Serbia, mainly in Stara Planina and Jerma river canyon. Besides creating programmes for adventure tourism, they conduct researches of flora and fauna in the area, as well as promote local products and create income for people living in the area. Stara planina (Old Mountain) is protected Nature park, with many natural assets. Territorial identity is made out of beautiful landscapes, natural pastures, forests and rivers/canyons. Local food and products are of high quaity and reputation, with many of them protected under PDO label, like Pirot hard cheese (Pirotski kackavalj), Pirot carpet (Pirotski cilim), Ironed sausage (peglana kobasica), etc. The area is bordering with Bulgaria. Mountain tourism in Serbia is very well developed. Nevertheless, mass mountain tourism with big infrastructure is massively impacting some of the most beautiful areas in Serbia. The Adventure Network is dedicated to create different type of touristic offers, respecting nature and enhancing people's dedication to environment protection, in the same time offering full experience of the area, food, and culture and people interaction. There is a rising interest for this type of touristic offers, especially with people who live in the cities, but would like to stay connected to the nature.   The Old Mountain has been placed under protection, in order to preserve: exceptional value of flora and fauna, places that express exceptional geological diversity of the area, such as certain landforms, special occurrences of surface and groundwater and rock formations, beauty and diversity of landscapes, cultural values represented by medieval monasteries and other immovable cultural goods, objects of folk architecture, traditional tools, objects, occupations and customs of local population. Local food and food products play very significant role and represent valuable asset of cultural and gastronomy heritage of the area.    Old Mountain and Pirot district are bordering region with Bulgaria, with very high level of depopulation. Many villages in the most beautiful parts of the mountains are becoming abandoned, or with few old inhabitants. Infrastructure to the villages is not good, creating even bigger problems for the remaining population. On the other hand, the touristic interest is rising, as well as interest for exploiting natural resources of the mountain, such as building mini-hydro plants at mountain rivers and streams, endangering living ecosystems in and around rivers and right to water. Use of mountain streams for fish production is linked to clear and not pollute waters and springs. The environmental impacts of current economic activities in the area is high, including poor waste management, construction in the protected areas, pollution of rivers and lake Zavoj (water supply lake), etc. Prevailing farming is livestock production (sheep and cows), used for meat production, as well as for production of milk and dairy products, but the number of animals is rapidly reducing. Two autochthonous breeds of sheep and cattle are present in the area (Karakachan sheep and Busha cattle), but their numbers are also reducing, with threatening possibility to loose these valuable genetic breeds. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Adventure network is creating new types of touristic offers for individuals and families that are in line with sustainability, nature protection and protection of the local identity, cultural and historical assets. Low footprint of touristic offers and programmes they create, build awareness of people about importance of nature preservation. Inclusion of local potentials, products and people, create additional value for the area, supporting people to stay in the area instead of migrating to bigger cities, or other countries. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   VC is present in other mountain regions, as well as in other protected areas in Serbia."
