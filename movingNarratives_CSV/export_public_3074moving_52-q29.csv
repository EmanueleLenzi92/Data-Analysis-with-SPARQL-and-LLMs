Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 ES. This VC applies a holistic approach, where nature and culture are intertwined. It aims for a responsible tourism with high commitment to the territory. There are multiple actors: Andalusian government, ADIT Sierra Morena (regional development association), municipalities, accommodation, restaurants, and other tourism-oriented companies. All the assets on which this VC relies are integrated within the social-ecological-system of Sierra Morena.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Aracena. The locality is integrated in the Natural Park of Aracena and Picos de Aroche and this has conditioned its economy. The ecosystem is dominated by holm oaks and cork oaks in a dehesa landscape, where livestock grazes (important for the Iberian ham production in the area) and dense forests of similar tree species complemented by arbutus, bushes of juniper and rockrose and diverse aromatic herbs. In Aracena we can find the Iberian Ham Museum (Museo del Jamón) where the visitor can learn about the relationship between Iberian pigs and ham and the dehesa ecosystem. In addition, the Ruta de Jabugo (Jabugo route) links 31 municipalities of the region where ham is produced, with an extense area within the boundaries of the Natural Park.   The size of the area (km2) is 184.75. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 200. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 851. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 44.68. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 6.70%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 14145. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 9599.3. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 8.33%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 27.46%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 64.21%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.

The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 97.1. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.30%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 13.90%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 68.80%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   It integrates various assets of the region. It mainly consists of cultural and natural landscape enjoynment, bird watching, and local gastronomy. New products such as Iberian ham routes and bird- watching tours are offered by this type of sustainable rural tourism. These new products (e.g., Iberian ham route) are based on new governance systems, where several actors (conservation, bird-watching, restaurantes, accommodation, heritage museums, ..) are involved and collaborate with each other to offer the final product. E-commerce is increasingly being used for promotion and marketing purposes.   1) Making this tourism model more appealing to the visitors and competing this way against the mainstream tourism which is mainly based in coastal areas; 2) Raising awareness among the tourists regarding the benefits and opportunities of sustainable tourism; 3) Resolving seasonality of emplyment in the tourism sector. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. There are several innovative initiatives by regional government, municipalities, private businesses and also rural associations. Here are two examples: 1) Los Pedroches and Jabugo Iberian ham routes (ruta de jamón de Los Pedroches y Jabugo) to visit rural areas of great ecological and also social-cultural value, to enjoy the scenic beauty, and to taste iberian ham and enjoy the local gastronomy; 2) Orniturismo, a project partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund to protect and enhance the ornothological heritage of the area and consolidate sustianable toruism activites that reactivate the economy of the region. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry, Natural land and Urban areas. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   This VC is present in the Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche Natural Park in Huelva, in the Sierra Norte Sevillana, as well as in the Sierra Morena Cordobesa and in the oriental part around the Andújar Natural Park in Jaén."
