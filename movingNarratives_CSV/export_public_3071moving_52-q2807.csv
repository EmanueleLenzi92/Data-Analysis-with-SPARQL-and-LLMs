Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 45 ES. The production occurs in the small orchards located in the described area, both in dry and irrigated land. The production is destined to different markets for its raw sale in Madrid, Israel, or Germany or for its transformation in Puente Genil, Murcia, France, or Portugal. The harvesting process is carried out with the utmost care because although it is hard, its rind is fragile. Traditional techniques have been replaced by more sophisticated agronomic methods throughout the process, from flowering to harvesting and the rest of the year in the thinning and pruning.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Carcabuey. The cultivation of quince is complementary to olive groves, the main crop in the area, adapting very well to the area's climatic and agronomic environment. It is part of a long-established tradition in the municipalities of Carcabuey and Priego de Córdoba. More recently, the incorporation of new processed products such as juice and vinegar has taken place, thanks to the Cooperative Almazaras de la Subbética, centralizing the process of distribution and marketing of the product.   The size of the area (km2) is 79.78. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 600. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1300. The total population (in thousand) is 2.371. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 29.72. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.12%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9969.71. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13153.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 10.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.89%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 370. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,07%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 522. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 82.5. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.62%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 66.48%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   Quince is traditionally produced from a local, rounded and small variety in the area. A sweet has been obtained, and more recently, juice and vinegar have also been made. It is an innovative mix that combines new products and processes with new marketing strategies and collaboration among many cooperative members and value chains within the same cooperative (olive oil, table olives, almonds, goat's milk, and quince products).   Quinces from the production area (Carcabuey, Priego de Córdoba, and Rute) with a harvest between October and November reaching approximately 4,000 tons/year.    Progressively it is being produced with more significant environmental and technical care to obtain high-quality fruits. It is a unique market that demands quality and innovation. There is a growing demand for organic quince. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Since the end of the 1960s, quince juice production began to be experimented with, and it has been taken up more recently by the Almazaras de la Subbética Cooperative, which has also incorporated quince vinegar (dry and sweet). The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Other areas, even nearby (Puente Genil) are specialized in the production of quince jam but not so much juice or vinegar. In other Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Greece, similar quince-based preparations can be found."
