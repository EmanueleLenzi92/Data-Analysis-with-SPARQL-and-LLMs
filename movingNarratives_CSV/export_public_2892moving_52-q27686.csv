Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 33 IT. The wine produced in the area has 2 appellations: PDO 5terre (a white wine from local varieties Bosco, Albarola, Vermentino), and PDO 5terre schiacchetra (a dessert wine from the same grapes). From the 500 hectars of the 50'ies, the vineyard surface is now reduced at about 80 hectars, divided in small lots with an average surface of 2,500 square meters. The commercial production of wine has 4 actors, three family owned estates and a cooperative, this last producing 55% of the total volume of wine of the area. Most wine is sold through the HORECA channel (Hotel, Restaurants, Caterings) and usually has is totally absorbed by local clients. The limited volume of wine of the region do not require the introduction in other domestic or export markets. Nevertheless, the high cost of production and the ecosystem service provided to the landscape would require much higher selling prices, that the local community is not open to accept: therefore, instead of promoting the local wine together with other products of the territory, restaurants of the region tend to propose cheaper wines from other regions. The unsufficient income and the increase of average age of the grapegrowers make questionable the sustainability of this value chain. Several initiatives to mantain viticulture in the region did not succed for lack of adherents: i) land bank, with lots of agricultural land offered for free to new farmers, and ii) public contributions to land consolidation. Excess of bureaucracy makes ineffective most of public initiatives to support present and future grapegrowers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is 0. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is RIOMAGGIORE. The Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. The coastline, the five villages, and the surrounding hillsides are all part of the Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Cinque Terre area is a popular tourist destination. Over the centuries, people have built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the Ligurian Sea. Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages as cars can only reach them with great difficulty from the outside via narrow and precarious mountain roads.   The size of the area (km2) is 10.27. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 787. The total population (in thousand) is 1.421.

The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 44571. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 18.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 80.23%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1142. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 2.72%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 8872. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 121. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified.

The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.46%.   'Survival viticulture', cooperation to rescue some econonmic value on the chian, and to provide basic infrastructures (irrigation, monorail),. Cinque Terre viticulture is an essential component of landscape and the sole agricultural economic activity for the area. Some technical and organisational solutions that allow survival of the value chain might be of some interest for other important albeit residual agriculture activities.   Cinque Terre landscape attracts every year more than 3 million turists from all over the world. The cooperative winery absorb 55% of the local grape production (in total 80 hectars of vineyard), the rest is split into anly 2 commercial wineries. Cooperative has 200 members, with an average contribution of 800 kgs of grape each. Through the cooperative affiliation, the tiny grapegrower can afford investments like the monorail to reach the sloping terraces, the water acqueduct to have water available for plant treatments, the reconstitution of traditional stone walls to keep the soil into terraces.    High level of land fractionation, extremely steep slope, vine cultivation in terraces of 2-3 row, 100% manual work, increase of farmer average age, are the main causes of a progressive reduction of agriculture activity in the Cinque Terre region. Viticulture is in practice the sole culture that still has some commercial dimension, but facing important obstacles in the lack of regulation tailored on heroic viticulture, scarce support by local institutions, scarce availability and high cost of productive factors, mainly labour. Even if Cinque Terre is one of the most famous international tourist destinations, rarely it was found a synergy between territorial products (essentially wine and some olive oil) and local commerce. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Introduction of monorails for transportation of material and people in the steep slope vineyard parcels; Installation of a water supply system to allow wet plant protection treatments in small vineyard plots; recostitution of traditional cement-free stone walls, with landscape significance. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and social."
