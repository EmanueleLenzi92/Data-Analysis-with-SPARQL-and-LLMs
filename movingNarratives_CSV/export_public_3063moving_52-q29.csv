Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 33 ES. From the Sierras Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas some 8,000 head of cattle make this round trip every year, on public roads, looking for better pastures and climate. A journey between mountains and plains of 20 days and about 300 km. In the case of the Sierra de Castril in Granada, five herdsmen spend eight days on a journey that extends almost 100 km. Transhumance shepherds have a profound knowledge of the environment, transhumance being one of the most sustainable and efficient methods of livestock rearing. They also have special practical skills related to the production of food and various handicrafts.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Castril. The rearing and maintenance of livestock, the management of land, forests, water resources and natural hazards, as well as the traditional practices of shepherds, make transhumance an important factor in shaping the relationship and interaction of man with animals and ecosystems. Extensive livestock farming, which is much more than transhumance, expresses its contribution to the environmental conservation of the territory when we overlap the areas where it is practiced with the network of livestock trails and the Natura 2000 Network.   The size of the area (km2) is 243.05. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 750. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1950. The total population (in thousand) is 2.02. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 8.31. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -17.60%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 8160.26. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 15101.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 7.47%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 14.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 77.88%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 764. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,14%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 726. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 125.9. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 9.74%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.46%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 73.80%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   Transhumance in Europe is a form of pastoralism consisting of the seasonal movement of livestock along migratory routes in the Mediterranean area and the Alps. Every year, in spring and autumn, thousands of animals are driven from one climatic region to another along historical routes. Spain has a network of 125,000 km of cattle trails, a public good, for the use of people and livestock. Since 2019, transhumance, the seasonal movement of herds along migratory routes in the Mediterranean and the Alps, has been inscribed by UNESCO (14.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Numerous national and international initiatives aim to maintain and renew this practice as an appropriate strategy for livestock management and natural ecosystems, testing innovative management alternatives, diversifying new complementary activities and articulating a widespread social and cultural support movement.   Following the centuries-old practice of livestock transhumance (sheeps, goats and cows), in November the herds that have spent the summer in the highlands of the Natural Park of the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in Jaén and Castril in Granada, make their particular journey through the province of Jaén, towards the lowlands of Sierra Morena to spend the winter. With this extensive practice, a single herd combines the management of two farms of high environmental value.    Transhumance must overcome the state of occupation and abandonment of livestock trails and infrastructures, as well as the difficulty of living in places with basic living conditions. The aging of transhumance shepherds and the lack of a public strategy to support extensive livestock farming add to the difficulties of their survival. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Transhumance is essentially a traditional value chain that keeps the associated practices intact. However, recognizing its environmental, economic and social importance, it has focused the attention of researchers, municipalities, technical projects and initiatives promoted by civil society aimed at vindicating its survival, the heritage legacy represented by the livestock trails and this peculiar form of livestock economy. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Different Spanish regions and provinces have had a long history of transhumance (Soria, Cuenca, La Rioja among others). In Andalusia a movement survives between the Sierras of Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in Jaén, as well as the Sierra de Castril in Granada to Sierra Morena, as well as movements between Sierra Nevada and the plain area of Granada. Similar movements of transhumant cattle are still practiced in other European regions of Italy, Austria and Greece."
