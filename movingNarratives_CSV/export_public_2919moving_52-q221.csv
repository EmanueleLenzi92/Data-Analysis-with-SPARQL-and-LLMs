Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is NMK. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 22 NMK. Key actors dealing with honey in Maleshevija and the kew brands: a) Pcelarstvo Bobolibbksi b) Shumi Med c) Maleshevski Med d) Pcelarstvo Radinski . At national level there are 2 national federations that are members of a larger umbrella organization called the Federation of Farmers of Republic of Macedonia that unites all farmers in the country. Organic beekeepers are each individually involved through the local associations of producers into the Macedonian Organic Producers Federation which represents exclusively the interests of organic producers.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Mountain Meleshevija. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is unspecified. Maleshevski mountains are located in the eastern part of the Republic of North Macedonia. The are covers the municipalities of Berovo and Pehchevo, and is characterized with the natural and cultural wealth. Two rivers cross the region, Bregalnica and Strumica. Forests covers 52% of the Maleshevija region, while pastures around 20%.   The size of the area (km2) is 806. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 660. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1932. The total population (in thousand) is 174.341. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 49.3. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 83.4. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.20%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 5056. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 769. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 9.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 45.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 44.53%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 5175. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 9332. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 9.75%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 62.50%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 2088. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 26003. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 30.50%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 53.30%.   Because of the geographical location and the relief of Macedonia, the climate in the country is partly Mediterranean and Continental, and on the mountains with peaks over 2000 meters the climate is Mountainous and it offers a very good condition for the honey and honey products. Royal jelly, a white and viscous jelly-like substance, is a form of hypopharyngeal and mandibular gland secretion from the worker bees. It is also known as a superfood that is solely consumed by the queen bee. Royal jelly is widely used as a dietary nutritional complex to help combat various chronic health conditions. Furthermore, it is one of the profitable remedies for human beings in both traditional and modern medicine. Many pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antitumor, antiallergy, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects have also been attributed to it.   Global climate change, environmental pollution, the decrease in natural lands under human pressure weaken the bees and make them more vulnerable to diseases. Chemicals used sometimes wrongly and needlessly, by farmers and beekeepers, excessive and unnecessary treatment of the hive/colony, are threating the honey across the country , including Maleshevija-Osogovski mountain. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Royal Jelly is used in different final innovative products. Recent years have seen the fast application of bee products in both traditional and modern medicine. Currently, many studies are targeted toward investigating directed health benefits and pharmacological properties of bee products due to their efficacies including the Royal jelly. Royal jelly consists of water (50% 60%), proteins (18%), carbohydrates (15%), lipids (3% 6%), mineral salts (1.5%), and vitamins 16 . Based on modern spectrometric analysis, approximately 185 organic compounds have been detected in royal jelly. Royalactin is the most important protein present in royal jelly. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Social and cultural.   Given that honey with dried fruits is a usual product, it is also present in other Member States."
