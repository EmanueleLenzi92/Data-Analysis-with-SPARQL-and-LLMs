Harris tweed is important for territorial identity of Western Isles. It is a highly reputable product with a legal act behind it. Strong connection to the natural asset - the land in the Western Isles.   Harris tweed relies on maintaining the mountainous landscape so that sheep can continue to be kept on this land. Also natural assets such as scenery are also important for drawing visitors to the Western Isles. Cultural assets are important as tweed production relies on long-standing traditional methods of production, for both the wool sheering and the production of tweed. Also given that Harris tweed can only be produced on the Western Isles, this represents its importance as a cultural and social asset. Other Social assets include good relations with local farmers and processors of harris tweed.    Although the majority of the wool for harris tweed comes from the UK mainland, maintenance of mountainous land mass in Wetern Isles for the additional harris wool into the mix is important. Thus maintaining land use important. Threats to exports and tourism due to Brexit and COVID. Threats of cheaper fraudulent copies of Harris Tweed being produced more cheaply. It is considered a sustainable industry due to its localised production methods and environmentally friendly methods too. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. This is a traditional VC as it uses long-standing traditions for gathering, making and processing the tweed. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Harris tweed is unique to Western isles - it legally cannot be made elsewhere. Similar uses of wool are undertaken/ processed throughout the Member State including tartan production (another wool product) used for a range of items including kilts. Tartan is produced across the Highlands and Islands. Wool from Shetland (LAU1) has a PDO."
