Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 CH2. The malthouse has 34 members, including 14 farmers, 16 breweries and other malt processors, as well as 14 other people interested in the development of the regional brewing industry. Farmers can bring in their barley, which is processed into malt to be used in the production of beer.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Orvin; Bourrignon; Delémont; Haute-Sorne; Val Terbi; Les Bois; Saignelégier; Cornol; Courgenay; Fahy; Basse-Allaine. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 29093.

The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 114.02. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 6.46%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25178.56. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.43%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 56.92%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 41.65%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 24844.22. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 714. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.77%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 338. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 46. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 4.58%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 34.13%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 61.29%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Cooperative that promotes barley from the Jura region and shortens the production circuit of local beer, from the barley sower to the consumer, by setting up a malting plant. New governance system as a cooperative where the malthouse is owned by the members who take part in the decisions , new product since the barley from the Jura Arc is used as malt to produce beer, which did not exist in the region .   Horizontal cooperation amoung all the actors in the VC, participatory funding, strong community interaction.    The cultivation of barley varies greatly with the weather flucutations and the quantities of barley processed therefore vary greatly, which can penalise downstream beer production. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation comes from the creation of this cooperative with participatory funding, including all the actors involved in the production of the beer in a horizontal and participative process. The innovation is related to New products and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Social."
