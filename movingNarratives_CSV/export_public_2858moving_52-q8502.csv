This farm closes the production chain of a typical traditional local product ('pepperoni cruschi') with the processing and sale to the final consumer. The dried fried sweet peppers are the flagship product, but the farm also produces and sells other products, such as aubergines in oil, and there is a cattle farm. The farmer Arleo was nominated the best 2020 Guardian Farmer ( Contadino custode ) because its activities are oriented to preserve the local agro-biodiversity. The Masseria Casa Arleo products are also certified by Prodotti di montagna label (Mountain products). Processing, packaging and direct sale of local products also via digital platforms.   The dried fried sweet peppers ('peperoni cruschi') are a typical product of the Basilicata region's food culture that the farmer tries to exploit in an innovative way combining the preservation of the rural tradition and the enhancement of local excellence also using digital platforms to sell.    The VC is relatively tiny. Farmer is involved in regional farmer associationism, but its VC does not include other local farmers. The socio-environmental elements of the SES engaged in the VC are the farmer skills, traditional local vegetables and local culture. The farmer production seems not well market-oriented and not very connoted in term of both local culture and sustainable production. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. In this case, the farmer closes the local product's production cycle, and he is personally involved in preserving the local food culture and biodiversity. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Cultural.   In its land is present a ZAC (dog training area) specifically for hunting dogs."
