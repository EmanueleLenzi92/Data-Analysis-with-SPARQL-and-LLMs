Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 FR1. Diversified organic market gardening with direct sale or local distribution is representative of the local agri-food landscape of the Drôme Valley. It represents 190 producers and 314ha of organic vegetable production which make Drome departement the 1st producer of organic vegetal in France. Most of the vegetables produced in the Drôme Valley are distributed locally (except garlic and onions). This VC is characterized by diversified and productive cultivation on small surfaces, innovative agro-ecological techniques using less water and land and preserving biodiversity, direct sale and distribution in local circuit. This type of production is innovative because it produces local added value and jobs in the area, meets local demand for vegetables, fruits, cereals and plants and contributes to food autonomy at the local and regional level. Besides, it promotes agroecological and social values.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Drome Valley. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Drome departement.

Diversified organic market gardening with direct sale or local distribution is representative of the local agri-food landscape of the Drôme Valley. The study of the value chain of organic market gardening presents the following interests - Diversified and productive cultivation on small surfaces. - Innovative agro-ecological techniques using less water and land. - Direct sale and distribution in local circuit - Production of local added value and jobs in the area - Meeting local demand for vegetables, fruits, cereals and plants - Contribute to food autonomy at the local and regional level. new products: diversification to propose products responding to the local food demand; use ancient variety and farmer seeds new processes: agroecological practices to adapt to water scarcity and to produce quantity in small parcels new marketing strategies: direct sale, distribution in local supply chanel.   Naturel asset: agroecologic practices respectful of biodiversity and water scarcity challenges Social asset: response ot local food demand, autonomy, cooperation between farmers, promotion of ecological and social values.    This VC is challenged by: competition with bigger actors, acces to water, marketing technics, the need to propose a production corresponding to local food demand. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. - innovative agroecological practices - high diversification on small parcels - direct sale and answering local food demand. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland and water. The local assets include Natural and social.   Drome is the first organic departement of France, where diversified organic market is strongly developped and illustrates the possibility of developping local food production responding the local food demand."
