Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 31 ES. There are about 300,000 head of Malaga goats in Spain. About 200,000 in the province of Malaga, distributed in more than 1,500 goat farms, the largest European concentration of this livestock. The suckling goat is an animal of one month of age, with a live weight between 8 and 10 kilos, fed exclusively on mother's milk. The breed is controlled through a Stud Book or certification by the Spanish Association of Malaga Goat Breeders (Cabrama). The 'Marca de Garantía Chivo Lechal Malagueño' (Malaga Suckling Goat Guarantee Label) implies the fulfillment of an exhaustive set of conditions. Malaga suckling goat meat is increasingly consumed in the province of Malaga and beyond. 80% of the cattle farms have some territorial base so that the predominant management in the farms is semi-extensive. It confers unique properties, aroma, and flavors to the meat and milk, transmitted to the cheeses and the rest of the derived products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic Systems. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Canillas de Aceituno. The Sierras Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama, are Natural Park since 1999. With its 2,065 m. altitude and very diverse flora, its lands are suitable for the cultivation of vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees such as orange, fig, and loquat, etc. Its marginal character has favoured the conservation of the landscape, traditional architecture, and its natural values.

The Malaga goat, a native Spanish breed, is highly prized for its milk production and its suckling goat meat quality. It has excellent fertility rates, being the Malaga milk goat, the first Spanish goat meat, and the first fresh meat in Andalusia, to have a quality label. The Malaga goat sector has a great potential for job creation. In addition to agri-food, with all its ancillary industry, catering and gastronomy or agrotourism, there are still other opportunities to be exploited. Cosmetics, linked to goat's milk, or all the goat skin crafts are two examples of lines to be developed.   Malaga goat farming performs important environmental tasks through local resources, fire prevention, soil and biodiversity maintenance, and ecosystem conservation. The Malaga goat generates landscape and takes advantage of crop residues and marginal areas that other livestock types cannot graze. The management of the Natural Park promotes the integration of the goatherds with the natural space management.    The greatest challenge is keeping the farms alive in the face of generational replacement problems, excessive bureaucracy, lack of nearby slaughterhouses, low meat prices that remain the same as 20 years ago, and the need to establish an articulation of the sector. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Much has been done to promote the quality and differentiated value of this meat. Unfortunately, a strong business model has not yet been secured to accompany the development of new strategies, in any case, associated with some local restaurants that have innovated using the product, its processing, and online sales to take home processed product. The innovation is related to New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The total census of Malaga goats is approximately 300,000 head, including the province of Malaga, with about 200,000 specimens. It is found in other Andalusian areas, Spanish regions, Portugal, and northern Morocco."
