Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 50 CH2. The key actors are the farmers themselves, as it is a farmer-driven and motivated action. There is no particular organisation within this value chain. Each farmer manages and promotes his activity independently. They are all in direct competition.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura.

The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 218.62. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 383. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1650. The total population (in thousand) is 245.48. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 112.29. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 4.82%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 27254.85. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 26722.71. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   This activity allows farmers to diversify their activity and increase their resilience to climatic or economic shocks. The innovation is not a new product but a new service offered by the farm, which is a night, a meal or a daily activity.   The local assets represent all the natural and cultural capital present to motivate a tourist to stay in this region (monument, local horse breed, canoing, landscapes, etc.) . This can be directly on the farm but also in the surrounding area.    Visibility to customers can be the major challenge in carrying out this activity. Competition between farms can be another difficulty, as they often offer similar services. It is therefore necessary to know how to differentiate and make yourself visible. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Innovation comes from diversifying farmers' activities and not just focusing on food production. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
