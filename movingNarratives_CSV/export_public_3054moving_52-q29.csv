Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 ES. The breeding of equines has been traditional in the Cabra and Zuheros mountain ranges for centuries, first as work and transport animals, both horses and mules and donkeys. Fifty years ago there was a change in production orientation and since then two stud farms have been dedicated to the breeding of the Pura Raza Español (PRE). The horses are highly recognized in morphological and dressage competitions, both national and international, and have even participated in the Olympics. The stud farms follow the complete process of breeding foals that are sold at one year of age or from three years of age when the dressage process begins.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Cabra. Horses are bred extensively, they grow and develop in a natural environment, where altitude, rain, rocky terrain and winter cold give them a special strength. Nature itself prepares them to be functional and strong. There are two stud farms with 450 and 650 hectares of land, respectively, which include separate pastures for mares and foals, as well as some unique buildings. Horse breeding is a hallmark of these mountains declared a UNESCO World Natural Park and Geopark because of its impressive karst geomorphology.   The size of the area (km2) is 229.16. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 350. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1100. The total population (in thousand) is 20.347. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 88.79. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -4.30%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13,793,33. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13153.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 10.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.89%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 523. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,09%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1362. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 64.9. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.62%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 66.48%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   There is documentary evidence of horse breeding in the Sierra de Cabra since the XVI century. It is a special type of horse, wild, with bone, of great height and very functional. Thanks to the handling and the relief, the foals exploit the best functionality of the Purebred Spanish Horse. The main innovation is linked to the type of mountainous terrain and extensive breeding, as well as the orientation towards the specific breeding of Pura Raza Español (PRE) horses. In some cases, the activity has been diversified by combining beef cattle breeding and the opening of a restaurant.   Horses are bred extensively, they grow and develop in a natural environment, where altitude, rain, rocky terrain and winter cold give them a special strength. Nature itself prepares them to be functional and strong. There are two cattle farms with 450 and 650 hectares respectively.    The successive crises have diminished the national market for the sale of these foals, which on the other hand have their main outlet in the foreign market, where more and more Spanish Purebred horses are being sold. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The extensive management taking advantage of the relief and the suitability of the natural pastures, the taming of the colts, the combination with the breeding of black Andalusian cows (native breed) and the opening of a restaurant in one of the cattle ranchs are signs of innovation and identity. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Horses are present in the Spanish mountains. In the 1970s, Galicia had 22,000 wild horses in the mountains. Today, this number has been reduced and it is estimated that there are about half of them left. Even so, it is the largest semi-free-range horse population in Europe. In Portugal, we can mention the Garrano horse, located in semi-freedom in the mountains in the north of the country."
