Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 1. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 26 CH1. In the past, various nut trees were grown all over the Swiss mountain regions (e.g. chestnut in Ticino), but due to the low yield and difficult processing, nut cultivation has declined considerably. There is a very famous tart from Grisons whose main ingredient is walnuts, but today they are mainly imported. In 1951 there were over half a million walnut trees in Graubünden, but today there are fewer than 150,000. However, an interest group - supported by the organisation and label 'Alpinavera' - is trying to bring nut production back to Graubünden.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is unspecified.
