Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 CZ. Sheep husbandry has got a long tradition within the Sumava region. The VCs spans over all important activities - from breeding, husbandry, processing food and products towards marketing. The VC contributes to a typical image of the Sumava region. Due to a economic risk associated with sheep husbandry, the sheep are often kept on farms with other animals (cattle and/or goats). Since the different groups of ruminant utilize different groups of plants, farmers can manage various types of plots include those located in nature protected areas.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Prachatice. Prevailing area of the region (LAU 1 - Prachatice) consist of submontane highlands (with altitude 600-800 meters). Some settlements are located in the altitude around 800 meters. Climate conditions are affected by relatively high altitude of the region. The region is rich of forestsw, which cover 52 % of the region. Share of agricultural land (due to the high altitude) is above regional average (wthin NUTS 3 level). The region is highly attractive for tourist during WInter and Summer season due to the unique nature. The region includes two nature protected areas.   The size of the area (km2) is 1377. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 410. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1378. The total population (in thousand) is 50.978.

Sheep husbandry is a traditional farm activity located in Sumava region. The region is associated with a special breed of sheep 'Sumavska ovce/Sumava sheep', which belong to a catalogue of the world genofond of endangered farm animals. Sumava sheep can produce milk, meat and wool. Sheep husbandry is a traditinal farm activity that valorizes natural (grazing management), cultural (history and traditon of the sheep breed) and symbolic local resources (tourism) of the Sumava region. However, the traditional products from the sheep farms have been substituted by other goods, so there not a stable demand for the sheep products (namely meat and wool). Farms are creating new marketing chanels for selling their products.   Sumava Mountains provide pictoresque landscape and unique natural assects, the regions has been partly abandoned during the socialist-era (1950s-1989). In the last 30 years many farms have been renewed based on the pre-WII tradition. The region is highly attractive for tourists in Winter as well Summer season. The sheep farms and their products are highly attractive for tourists. Some of them offer also services in agro-tourism.    The VC is firmy embedded and the region and relies on local resources. Sheep farms are important providers of ecosystem services. (1) The VC faces economic challenges, the farms rely on agricultural subsidies. (2) The VCs is also vulnerable due to the ongoing climate changes. Dry seasons result in shortage of water that reduce availability of grass (hay). These changes may threaten farms with large herds that may not be able to secure enoough feedstuff for the sheep. (3) Farms are often located in nature protected areas (or nearby). There areas are also a home for some predators, such as wolves, that have ben re-introduced by humans. The predators are protected, however, they often cause damages to sheep farms. A present challenge is thus finding a balance between the environmental and economics interests that would enable to purseue the goals of the both sides. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Due to a fairly low demand for sheep products (meat and wool) that farms have to aim on innovations in area of marketing. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land and grazing meadows and management of perennial grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The classic breed of the regional sheep is also kept on farms in Germany."
