The Sarılop fig variety, which is the most suitable for drying, accounts more than 90% of the total fig production, and it is an important export product for the country. Fig is consumed fresh and dried. Dried fig is generally exported. Small family farmers are growing and harvesting fig, while cooperatives and firms processing, packaging and sell.   Aydın/Sarılop fig is very valuable and important for export. The altitude, soil type, climatic characteristics give this fig variety a lot of character.

The fig activities enforce the social bonds and have a positive impact on the conservation of the local population and their activities. Fig cultivation is an important activity in the North East Aegean region; apart from its economic value fig has a pronounced mark on the socioculture of the region.    High production cost, disease and pests, drought, geothermal energy waste are main challenges of the VC . High aflatoxin risk is one of the most important food safety problems in dried fig. Geothermal energy waste problem: geothermal energy plants near distance, located in the fig orchards quality and yield are negatively affected. Drought caused by climate change causes degradation of quality. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and social.   Neither dried nor fresh fig is included in other MRLs in the Member State.
