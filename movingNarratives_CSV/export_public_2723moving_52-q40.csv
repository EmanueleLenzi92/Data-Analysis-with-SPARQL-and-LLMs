Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 AT. The oil is produced by 4 family farms, who sell their product on-farm, in farmers' cooperative shops and other small shops in the region. The marketing is supported by the regional tourism initiative (Spielberg Tourismus).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Bruck-Mürzzuschlag (No: 621). The district of Bruck-Mürzzuschlag was created only recently in the course of a district merger. It is located in the eastern Alps in the northeast of Styria. The weather is considered to be very changeable. The region is located in the northern limestone Alps. The main valley is the Mürz valley, where the river Mürz flows into the river Mur near Bruck an der Mur. This valley intersection 'Mur-Mürz-Furche' has been an industrial area for decades. In the North of the Mürz valley there are also many side valleys, from where the Mürz river is fed.   The size of the area (km2) is 2156.9.

Climate changes in recent years have introduced the pumpkin cultivation in new regions, such as in the Murtal. It might be expected that the production of pumpkin seed oil might be further extended towards mountainous areas. In general, the Styrian pumpkin seed oil (PGI) is mostly / traditionally produced in non-mountenous areas. Due to changes in climate, in recent years pumpkins are also cultivated in the mountainous region Murtal . Some farmers produce pumpkin seed oil, but they are not allowed to use the PGI Steirisches Kürbiskernöl as the region was not producing that oil during the registration of this oil as PGI. Styrian pumpkin seed oil (PGI) is mostly / traditionally produced in non-mountenous areas. However, recently also in the mountainous region Murtal some farmers produce pumpkin seed oil, are however not allowed to use the PGI Steirisches Kürbiskernöl . Thus the regulatory framework is of high interest in the context of this VC.   The production of pumpkin seed oil enriches the local culinary landscape.    As already addressed above, farmers are not allowed to market the oil by using the PGI label. The fact that pumpkin seed oil from the Murtal is not officially a 'Styrian pumpkin seed oil' is due to that only products from certain regions are intended for this label. The growing areas of the pumpkins must correspond to defined political districts. A bit ridiculous in this context ist, that these traditional pumpkin growing areas are not only located in Styria, they can also be found in Burgenland and Lower Austria, but the area is not expandable, even if it is located in Styria. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The cultivation of pumpkins, which had not been grown in that region traditionally, was introduced by some farmers. In cooperation with a local destillery a unique schnaps with pumpkin seeds was created. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural.   Pumpkin seed oil is usually not produced in Austrian mountainous regions."
