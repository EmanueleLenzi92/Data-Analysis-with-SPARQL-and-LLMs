Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 21 ES. Pello Urdapilleta, the first producer of the Slow Food Presidium, transforms his flavorful meat into a range of cured meat products. The SLOW FOOD Presidium was created to develop and promote traditional sausages made from Euskal Txerria pigs. The project wants to encourage other local farmers and artisans to follow Pello's example, and results are already being achieved. Euskal Txerria-based dishes are starting to appear on the menus of local restaurants and some renowned Basque restaurants. Pello's model farm is regularly visited by children and students interested in discovering a portion of food that was a staple of the Basque diet for many centuries.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Cantabrian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Bidania-Goiatz. Bidegoian is the highest municipality in the historical territory of Gipuzkoa. Surrounded by farmhouses, forests, and mountains, among which Ernio (1,075 m) stands out. Bidegoian has managed to maintain the essence of rural Gipuzkoa. Also, this isolation has contributed to the preservation of the natural environment that surrounds the municipality in perfect condition. The pigs take care of the beech forest. They graze in the meadows, together with sheep and cows and goats on steep terrain.   The size of the area (km2) is 13.74. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 450.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, every farmhouse in the Basque Country had a small group of pigs. It was a similar situation throughout Celtic Europe, although the livestock trade flourished much more in the Basque Country. There were even three autochthonous breeds of pigs: the Baztanesa, the Chato Victoriano -both extinct- and the Euskal Txerria. In the 54-hectare Elola Farm, beautiful green meadows are planted with ryegrass, white and purple clover, mountain grasses and alfalfa, nettle and rumex roots, and the fruits of centenary native hardwoods, which make up the majority of the pigs' feed. In winter, the rainy, snowy, icy, and windy season their feed is supplemented with cereals such as corn, beans, barley, fodder, alfalfa, peas, and bran. All this, together with this ancient autochthonous pig breed's slow development, means that their fattening life span is almost 24 months, reaching a weight of 120-140 kg.   The Slow Food Presidium pigs are only raised extensively and do not exceed 14 animals per hectare: they graze freely on acorns, chestnuts, hazelnuts, and grass. They only reach a proper fattening phase in their last two months, feeding on corn, beans, and bran (only non-genetically modified feed is used) until they get 120 kilos in weight, at which point they are slaughtered.    Of the three autochthonous pig breeds of the Basque Country until 1974, only the Euskal Txerria survives. In 1929, 158,000 head were registered, but in 1989 there were barely 25 head left. In 1989 in the Aldudes Valley, the 'Association of the Pie Noir du Pays Basque' was created around Pierre Oteiza. In 1996 Pello Urdapilleta started the recovery of the 'Euskal Txerria' breed. Today he has a herd of Celtic trunk pigs, enjoying extensive meadows and forests. The challenge is to maintain a herd that today has about 400 mothers and 50 boars, slaughtering about 2000 heads per year. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The Urdapilleta online Store delivers a wide range of products, including ham, shoulder, loin, txorizo, cured chorizo, fresh chorizo, txistorra, lukainka, salchichón, pate, and pancetta, among other products. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Also called Pie Noir , the Basque pig is a breed of Iberic pig and is one of the 6 acknowledged local races along with the Gascon, the Limousin, the Corse, the Western White, and the Bayeux. The Basque pig originally comes from the Basque country, Bearn and Hautes Pyrénées regions of South West France. Nearly extinct and declared as an endangered species in 1981 by the Ministry of Agriculture , the Basque pig has survived thanks to the perseverance and commitment of a handful of local breeders."
