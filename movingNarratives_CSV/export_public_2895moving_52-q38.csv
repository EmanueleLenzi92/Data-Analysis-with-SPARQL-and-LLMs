Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 40 IT. Forests (PEFC certified) produce timber and wood that are used by local sawmills to produce materials for other local actors to produce construction pieces, frames, pieces of furniture etc. Resonance woods are sold in annual auctions and bought by local but also foreign instruments producers. By products (sawdust, chips etc) feed a local biomass plants network to produce heat/energy. All the value chain, and product thereof, can use the PEFC certification system, with the scope to increase the value and identity of the timber/wood for all actors. The value chain involves about 200 enterprises (small), forest owners (municipalities, commons managers, private owners), sawmills, wood products producers, side-products users. Many of them are members of the cooperative (https://www.legnoservizi.it/soci/).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ampezzo and Sauris (2 adjacent municipalities). Carnia is the North-Western part of Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. It includes large part of Carniche Alps mountains and valleys, with more than 20 picks above 2000m on sea level and 4 main river valleys, the Natural Park of Friulian Dolomites. The climate is colder than analogous areas (300m lower vegetation limits) and high rainfall. Number of inhabitants dramatically dropped after Second World Word, from 66000 to less than 35000 nowadays, with a high average age and low birth rate. Economy is based on few industries localized in the valleys, agriculture and forestry (declining) and tourism. Tourism in increasing especially in new forms, not so much linked to skying resorts as it used to be, but more linked to trekking, biking and outdoor activities, cultural events and resources, thermal stations. In terms of use of the land, there is a rapid and progressive increase of forest share, due to the abandonment of steep or small plots. Small size and scattered properties are a weak point of local farms, that hampers their economic sustainability. Dairy production is the main agriculture activity that can count on the use of a net of mountain huts for Summer high altitude pastures use, with relevant impact on cheese and landscape quality.   The size of the area (km2) is 115.1186. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 450. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2120. The total population (in thousand) is 1.35. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 13-9.5 (2 municipalities). The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -9.3%;-8.1%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 153.3. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -1.25%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 16829. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 34743. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.90%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 29.10%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 68.90%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 17887. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 34742. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.90%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 29.10%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.90%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 1152. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 3.08%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 14041. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 60. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 30.90%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 66.30%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.70%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 30.90%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 66.30%.   1) high quality wood products ( construction timber, furniture use, even some resonance wood); 2) PEFC (Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes) collective certification; 3) valorization of by-products (for energy production in local plants) 4) partially collective ownership or public ownership of the forests; 5) a cooperative whose members are all involved actors (municipalities, private forest owners, wood/timber processors, users.); 6) part of the forests are National or Regional Natural Protected Areas; 7) touristic value. In several European mountain areas forest are an asset but very often their economic performance is too low to grant a continuity in their management. This case is an attempt to respond to the challenge of preserving environmental value of the forests but at the same time granting an economic sustainability. A key aspect is the attempt to solve the problem of property fragmentation and increasing age of owners and managers through a cooperative that can provide several services and supports.   In Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region, forests cover 41% of the total regional surface. 93% of the forest are in mountain areas (324.000ha) and employ about 200 forestry enterprizes. Large part of forests used to belong to Venice Republic (used for boat construction and city building) and have a traditional common management (now as Consorzio Boschi Carnici) besides area owned by private companies. In line with the common management the environmental certification process of all Regional forests and woods have been driven by the Regional Government and managed collectively. Now the cooperative Legnoservizi gathers all public and private actors in the value chain and can be the tool to faced described challenges. This describes the cultural/traditional and social assets, besides the fact that In Sauris a German speaking community is historically living, while in Ampezzo the local language is Furlan, with a minority of German speaking population. Concerning environmental assets: large part of the forests are protected areas (either under National or Regional protection schemes) and are the basis for the local touristic offer, so providing also an asset in economic terms. In environmental and economic terms another asset is the setting up of value chains, in last 10 years, for products and by products: timber for construction, wood for furniture, by products for energy production (biomass burning) and with some excellence like resonance woods for musical instruments production.    1) fast depopulation and aging of residents of the area; 2) climatic risks and actual damages due to climate change (VAIA storm in 2018); 3) increasing role of enterprises from other areas/countries, not engaged in the preservation of the area but selected on cost basis (open calls); 4) to maintain the added value locally (Regional RDP project running on how to increase market value of forests: https://www.legnoservizi.it/attivita/innovazione/) . Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Quality wood and timber production has historical background (since Venice Republic who owned large part of the forests) but its qualification, in terms of intrinsic quality, environmental certification and by-products valorization (for energy production) started about 20 years ago. The Regional Government supported the environmental certification scheme implementation with regionally funded projects and facilitated the establishment of a cooperative (www.Legnoservizi.it) for the management of forests and their products in order to safeguard the environmental value of the area (with touristic relevance too) and enhance their economic value, a key aspect for maintaining population in mountain areas and attract young people to work in the forest sector. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Vineyard area. The local assets include Natural and social.   The proximity with Austria and Slovenia allows an exchange of experiences and practices, even if the ecosystem (including the social and economic dimensions) are different. There is a flow also of economic actors and materials among the 3 countries. A common framework, overarching the 3 countries, was in the past studied in Interreg projects, but it is still a potential to be fully explored."
