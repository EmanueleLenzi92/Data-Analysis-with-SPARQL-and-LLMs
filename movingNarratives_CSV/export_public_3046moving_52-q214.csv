Special air quality in high mountains; tradition of spa resorts in Slovak mountains and related territorial identity of high mountains with healing recreational stays for people with respiratory problems. In the past, mining and metallurgical companies from all over Czechoslovakia built sanatoriums for their employees in high mountains in Slovakia. The healing method is basically an outdoor stay at the fresh air and walks or some physical exercise. Land use systems related to this use are natural areas and forests. Popular use of Slovak high mountains which has been increasing every year.   Natural assets are natural areas and forests. Social asset is an increasing society demand for visiting high mountain areas. Cultural asset is a tradition of visiting high mountain areas for healing and recreation.    1) Climate change and environmental quality may decrease air quality in the mountains. 2) Society demand: In the future, there is expected that a society's demand for healing stays in the mountains will increase due to numerous reasons: the health system supporting prevention, increase in health awareness of the people, increase in respiratory diseases, etc. Additionally, as Slovakia is an inland country, with mountains being the main areas for holidays and recreation, the accessible areas in the Slovak mountains were often crowded during last years. It causes less privacy for visitors and may harm vulnerable mountains' environment. 3) increasing urbanization and construction (sometimes illegal) in protected mountain areas. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as N/A.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and mountain air.
