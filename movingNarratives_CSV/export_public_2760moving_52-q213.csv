Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is CZECH REPUBLIC. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 CZ. Farms - sheep breeding, sheep husbandry, grazing, perennial grassland management. Farms often implement organic farming methods. Vast majority of farms process their own milk, produce dairy producsts and sell these products. Typical marketing chanells include (sales on farm, farmers markets, farm shops in nearby towns). Regional and other quality labels are not so important. The 'sheep products' are quite unusual a highly demanded by consumers. Demand for such products is fairly high, specific groups of consumers are willing to pay high premiums for such products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sumava - Cesky les. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is LAU 1 Trutnov. LAU 1 - Trutnov is the largest district within the NUTS 3 Kralovehradecky. The landscape of the region is very diverse with large differences in altitude. Such landscape makes the region less favorable for agricultural activities. 43,2% of the region covers agricultural land. Approximately a half of the agricultural land is arable land (53%).

The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 9762.62. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 23148.69. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 3.29%.

The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 55419. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.45%.

The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 59.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 36.26%.   Sheep husbandry is a typical VC that can be found on numerous mountain areas all over the Czech Republic. The sheep husbandry is very similar to the goat husbandry, however less common in terms of presence. Sheep dairy products represent a specific market niche. The products are highly demanded. The VC is typical of using organic farming methods and creating additonal process-baseed quality of the food products. The mountain areas and symboliv value of the region contributes to valorization of these food products. Sheep husbandry bring many positive effects in term of ecology, since the farms often employ specific grazing managements.   VC directly utilizes natural assets of the given locality (grassland, high nature value farming areas). Sheep are capable of using grassland in areas that may not be used by other ruminants (cattle, goats). At the same time farms located in mountain region also utilize the symbolic value of the territory. The mountains are associted with 'purity' and 'nature' and this association is typically used in the promotion of the food products from the given VC.    The sheep dairy products create unique niche market. The assets are very specific. Main challenge for the farms is associated with succesful marketing of the products. The farms are located in remote areas, but they need to sell their products to urban consumers, who are willing to pay for the premiums. Another challange is associated with economic pressure. Farms rely on direct payments, since much of their farming activities is linked with provision of ecosystem services. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Natural land and grazing meadows and management of perennial grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC constributes to a typical image of the farming in mountain areas. The VC is complementary to the VCs describing cattle and goat husbandry."
