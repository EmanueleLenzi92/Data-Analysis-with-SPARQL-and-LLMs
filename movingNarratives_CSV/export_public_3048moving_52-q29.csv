Around 400,000 bottles come out each season from the five current distilleries, especially of the most typical products such as sweet and dry anise, rosoli, or pacharán. Also noteworthy is the increase in alcohol-free liquors in recent years. Some of these distilleries have been active since the 19th century. Along with the production of liquors, they have given value to their historical heritage, receiving thousands of visitors in their facilities as well as in several thematic museums.

Rute brandy (also called ruteño or anise from Rute) is a dry aniseed brandy typical of Cordoba liquors tradition. The preparation is carried out by hydroalcoholic distillation in stills. The emergence of non-alcoholic liquors, the opening of tourist and cultural visits to the distilleries, and the creation of thematic museums have allowed a certain revitalization of the sector and maintenance of the activity and territorial prestige linked to the production of spirits in Rute.   This distillate of high graduation (45 -55 ) comes from the artisan distilleries located in Rute and Baena municipality (province of Córdoba) since the 17th century. It is characterized by its elaboration flavored by green anise seed, or Pimpinella Anisum from the fields of the province of Malaga.    The aniseed-flavoured spirits sector is less important than in the past, also due to the higher demand for lower alcohol degree beverages, the seventies' industrial crisis, and rigorous tax rates. All of that has contributed to the disappearance of many companies and currently there are only five. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation is associated with the need to introduce new products, associated cultural and tourist services and synergies with other productive sectors (mantecados, hams, etc.). The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are The activity does not directly connect with the use of agricultural land to obtain its products. However, it has given rise to a valuable real estate and cultural heritage linked to brandy and spirits' production system. The local assets include Social and cultural.   More than 3,000 towns in Spain have manufactured aniseed brandy, reaching more than 10,000 distilleries. In Andalusia, the spirits produced in the area of Cazalla de la Sierra (Sierra Morena) are worth highlighting."
