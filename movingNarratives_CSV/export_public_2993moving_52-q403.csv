Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 27 SER. There have been registered several operators in the last few year, while the number is probablly in dozens of small home made processing workshops. The processing is almost never linked to farming, so the raw material is bought localy from farmers. Direct sale on food events and festivals, linkaged to HORECA sector and lately specialized food shops and retial, have been the main marketing channel. This is one of the most expensive meat products, however the demaind is stil high due to very different nature of proecessing (most of the dried meat is usually smoked and pressed sausage isnt). This increased demand also threatens the quality of the product, as many are now trying to raise volumes at any costs.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Eastern Serbia, Balkan mountains region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Balkan mountains. Balkan mountains in Serbia or Stara planina Nature reserve, are he cheese was originally made from sheep milk since the area was well-known for the two indigenous breeds pirotska pramenka and pirotska pramenka oplemenena which freely grazed on the slopes of Stara Planina (Old Mountain). Following the changes in animal breeding, traditional cheese-making industry in Pirot has been slightly altered, and kačkavalj is nowadays produced from unpasteurized sheep's or cow's milk, or a combination of both. REcent years have brought incerased interest for the region and also tourism and agriculture, but not yet the improved policy frame for promoting sustainable practices.   The size of the area (km2) is 1232. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 368. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2169. The total population (in thousand) is 53.80. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 44.00. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -6.71%.

The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4557. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 75. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 45.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 52.80%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 38.40%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 56.40%.   Pirot pressed sausages is premium product, manufactured from the best quality of different kind of meat, mixed with spices. It is assumed that dates back to the time of the Ottoman empire and it truly reflects the diversity of livestock production in Serbian part of Balkan mountains (Stara planina Mt) which is a natuanal park. For making Peglana sausages carefully selected pieces of goat, sheep and beef meat are used, though some use even donkey meat. Though present for centruries, this product has been revived and in only last decade has gained much reputation and popularity as high quality typical product of mountain areas. It is naturally and slowly dried, no smoking or preservatives and know for a particular process of pressing, that has been traditional know how of local people. Linkages to Balkan mountains Natural park Stara planina and its livestock breeding systems as well as traditional know how of producing a durable meat product that is naturaly dried, make Pirotska pressed sausage one of the very recognizible brands of South Eastrn Serbia. Also, this region is very much in focus for aspirations for use of natural resources in many ways, for small hydro power plants which puts at risk much of the local rural population that lose access to fresh waater, to tourism pressures which are not always moderate and controled.   High quality meat localy raised on the pastures with strong floral biodiversity, is being transformed through unique process of pressing and drying to obtain a valuable and high protein content product. There is also cultural and social assets over nutritional and even medicinal values of this product which is considered very potent and concentrated 'super food' according to local criteria.    Depopulation and change of lifestyle from pasture grazing system to stationary are the main reasons for decline in number of sheep and milk shortage. There are 13760 sheep now, and the are the aging and uninhabited villages cannot sustain the needed production. Apart from these, the management of natural resources bocomes an issue with increased vulnerability and threat of investments in small hydro power plants that deprive population from fresh water and destroy watershead and scenary. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. A traditional product where the traditianal process has been taken over by the processing facilities of modern times. There is quite some new design of the small scale processing machinery that can replicate the old school of pressing with a bottle or similar round and smooth obect. The development of the product could be lately attributed to a sequence of local festivals, where forgoten product has been revived and reintroduced to the community, so that commercial production has started. Now it is on the way of protection of geographical name and has many new alterations in packaging, meat mixture (goat, sheep, cow or donkey) and spices. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
