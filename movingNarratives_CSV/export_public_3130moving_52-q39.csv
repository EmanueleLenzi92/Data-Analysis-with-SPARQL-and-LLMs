Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 06 CH2. The VC includes a family farm that produces, processes and sells yogurt directly on the farm. Sales are also made to local cheese dairies. The products is labbeled 'IP Suisse'.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Renan (BE). The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 1.26. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 823. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1265. The total population (in thousand) is 0.93. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 73.40. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 8.93%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 193.02. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25100.11. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.79%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 32.83%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 66.38%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25100.11. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 127943.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.86%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.65%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 60.49%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.00%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 21. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 75. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.59%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.22%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 59.19%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.63%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.61%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.57%.   Labelled product from the jura region, milk from the Swiss breeds Graubünden and Appenzell goats which belong to the ProSpecieRara foundation (foundation supporting the heritage and genetic diversity of plants and animals), milk produced and processed on a very diversified farm, on-farm direct selling, other use of grazing areas than cow cattle which is the main landuse system in the swiss mountains, pasture landuse system threatened by climate change with summer droughts. The diversity of the farm's activities therefore generates innovation and increases its resilience.   Dairy production is based on pastures (natural asset), which represent the typical swiss cultural landscape. Grazing therefore depends on these landscapes and these landscapes depends in return on cattle, otherwise they would return to the state of the forest. The goat species are part of pro specie rara, the Swiss foundation for the heritage and genetic diversity of plants and animals which represents a storng cultural heritage.    The natural resources on which the milk used for yogurt production is based are threatened by increasing droughts due to climate change (loss of fodder, death of spruce trees in wooded pastures changing the landscape and shade). There are uncertainties about the real effect of climate change on grassland production and animal health (reduced grass growth in summer but a one-month longer growing season depending on the scenario). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. Traditional, family-based and diversified agriculture farm who produces and tranforms and sells the goat's milk into yogurt on the farm. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
