Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 19 SCA. Family-owned forests in Finland represent between a 50-60% of the forestry land and produce about the 80 percent of the timber needed in industry. The average size of a family owned forest in Finland is 30,5 ha and more than a half is transferred by inheritance. The Forest Owner 2020 survey showed that tendencies of owners that live in urban settings are changing and new generations are willing to stay close to their forests. In fact, over 50% of the owners live in their holdings. The number of owners with higher education is also increasing. The growing season last around 80 days in Finland and in 2018 the average growth per day was of 1.3 million cubic metres. Forest industry is the main export sector in Finalnd.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean mountains - Lapland. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Rovaniemi. Rovaniemi is the capital of the Finnish region of Lapland. It is located near the Artic Circle. Due to its geographical location and environment, tourism has risen since the end of the last century (the average of visitors per year is 500000) attracted by the northern lights, winter sports, the village of Santa Claus, and reindeer or husky rides. For its importance as capital of the Finish Lapland, Rovaniemi has an international airport. The locality also hosts the Forestry Museum of Lapland where the history of this industry in the region is explained. In addition, in a close municipality, Kemijärvi, a biorefinery works, transforming wood into energy and other transformed and innovative materials.   The size of the area (km2) is 8016.75. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 45. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 360. The total population (in thousand) is 63.528. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 7.92. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 5.72%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 0.04. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -5.76%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 37754. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6018.6. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.18%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 34.42%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 61.41%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 37690. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 39217.42. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.19%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 29.23%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.57%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 26813. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 40.30%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 15630. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 205. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 2.04%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.77%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 81.28%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.94%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 23.35%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 70.71%.   It represents one of the main land use systems in Finalnd, and all along Scandinavia. Besides their natural value and relevance for nature conservation, forests have an important social and cultural value in this area. Innovations related to end-products based on wood nanocellulose are being developed. In addition, new processes in forest management are being tested, aiming to adapt to changing conditions, working both in practice with logging techniques and in research and IT (e.g., digital twin).   Finland is one of the most heavily forested countries in the world with 4 ha of forest per person. One of each five families in Finland own a piece of forest. However, access to all of the forest areas is free. Consequently, there is a strong link and also culture related to the forests among the Finnish people. The main tree species in boreal laitudes for forestry are Scott pine, spruce and birch.    Climate change will affect the methods and species in the industry. With warmer temperatures and higher rain rates, an increase in the yields is expected. Conversely, in some areas, the fire risk will grow, new pests and diseases will arrive and difficulties for the logging are also expected due to changes in soil structure. Turning the industry more sustainable is one of the biggest challenges facing Climate Change for which alternative logging methods are gaining attention. Finally, although trends are changing, there are concerns about the ageing of the industry. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The increased use of continuous-cover method over clear cutting and the integration of both is an innovation for the sector in Finland, where clear cutting has been the dominant method. In addition, new products such as wood isolation foams and wood-based packaging and textile products among others are breaking into the markets as sustainable alternatives for plastics. Finally, an EU project is aiming to develop a digital twin (virtual model) of forests in Finland, Germany and Romania to model and predict the development of forests and some of their services such as carbon storage. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Besides Finland, where the most productive forest area is located in the Eastern region, the VC is also present in Sweden and Norway."
