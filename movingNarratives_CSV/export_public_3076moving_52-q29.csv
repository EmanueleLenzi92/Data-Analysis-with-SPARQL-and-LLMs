Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 ES. In Cazalla de la Sierra there used to be around 15 destileries, but only two remain today. Its quality was once certified by a Comitee of Cazalla producers, which dissapeared with the other destilleries. Nowadays, the quality is recognised based on the history of this product and its relation with the locality, keeping the traditional making. In fact, the name of Cazalla for these kind of drinks directly reffers to the municipality of Cazalla de la Sierra that once was the main producer of anis drinks. The production of Cazalla started as a complementary industry of wine making and thanks to the wild aniseed that grows in the region. Nonetheless, the vines from the region Sierra Norte de Sevilla and the produced wines are still a growing asset, producing quality wines under a PDO label.

High quality product with old tradition in the area. The important wine production that Cazalla de la Sierra had during the 15th and 16th centuries, resulted in the distillation of the leftovers in order to obtain the alcohol with which this drink began to be manufactured.
