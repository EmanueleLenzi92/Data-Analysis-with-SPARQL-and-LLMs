Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 ES. In the Sierra Morena Cordobesa, there are around 1500 hunting grounds and 70000 hunters registered, and the extension of the hunting area within the province is of 437.852 ha. The area is covered by multitude of land uses, such as fields, dehesas (open oak forests) and mediterranean forests. In addition, all along the Sierra Morena, and also in the part that belongs to Corodba, there are protected areas where hunting is allowed. The main prey of the area is deer with more than 13000 animals hunted per year during the hunting period (from October to February).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra Morena.

Its landscape is dominated by mediterranean forest with holm oaks, cork oaks and undergrowth, in addition to riverside woods of willows, ashes and alders. It also hosts a big diversity of aromatic plants and grass species; and it has high hydrological value, with two reservoirs, El Retortillo and Bembezar, standing within the town's boundaries. Hunting is another important activity of the mountain reference landscape. More than the 60% of the area has a slope above 15%.   The size of the area (km2) is 585,84.

The hunting sector is experiencing an industralization that put under threat the natural ecosystems on which this activity depends. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   This VC is present all along the Sierra Morena region, including the provinces (NUTS2) of Huelva, Seville, Córdoba and Jaén."
