Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 SCA. Rakfish is fermented trout, and is one of the most extended traditional products in Norway. Fish is taken from the water and right after put into buckets with specific salt concentration and temperature to trigger a safe fermentation. In 2006, Rakfisk from Valdres was approved as a protected geographical indication. The fish must come from farms in Valres and be transformed into rakfish within the region. In 2001, Rakfisk from Valdres was the first rakfish in the country to get the quality Specialty of Food Label. They sell it all along Norway in stores and restaurants and through their website. One of the risks of this VC is the pollution associated with fish introduction into mountain water bodies. If it is not done under high control, it can lead to an increase in organic matter and mercury concentration in water, with dramatic consequences for the microbiome.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Nord-Aurdal. Nord-Aurdal is located between the valleys of Hallingdal and Gudbrandsdal. It has some large inland lakes like the Tisleifjorden and Aurdalsfjorden. More than 50% of the area is above 900 masl. The Valres region is one of the most well known for cross country skiing, hiking and mtb cycling. Fishing is also an important touristic asset of the region, where other activities such as farm visits, cheese making and cultural activities can be enjoyed by visitors. Livestock farming is also a traditional activity in the area with free ranged animals grazing in the alpine meadows during summer.   The size of the area (km2) is 906.48. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 304. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1325. The total population (in thousand) is 6.413. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 7.08. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.03%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 7.13. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.86%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 44096.75. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 7448.29. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 7.42%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 19.70%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 72.88%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 46253.25. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 15265.23. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 3.65%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 23.37%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 72.98%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 3704. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 14.54%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 4 271. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 185. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 1.21%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 15.43%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 83.36%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 4.27%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 22.73%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.03%.   Rakfish has a high reputation and long tradition in the Norwegian cuisine. E-commerce and quality and geographical indication labelling to improve marketing.   The fish farm consists of a series of ponds where fish swim. Water is in continous renewal from natural streams that flow through the ponds. This generates the best environment to breed fish as they can excersice swimming in fresh and clean water. Water temperature, speed and biochemical characteristics influence the fish quality. The social asset is represented in the PDO that brings producers together. Finally, the rakfish is a traditional product consumed all along Norway and the traditional fermentation method is quite unique in Europe.    In the light of climate change, this VC may face a challenge if the natural mountain water streams change their regimes as precipitations are expected to increase while snow cover period is expected to decrease. In addition, a rise in the mean temperatures is also expected, which could threat the population of trouts as they do not have high thermal tolerance. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The innovation is the e-commerce platform. Although they do not use anymore the traditional wooden barrels to cure the fish, the method and farm system is quite traditional. Another innovation may be the fact that rakfish from Valres was the first rakfish to get the Norwegian Specialty of Food Label, and one of the first fish products to get a PDO certification, as before 2003 the regulation did not allow it. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural water streams. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
