Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 RO. In the reference landscape chosen the key actors in the certified value chain are private forest owners (in other regions there is more state- and/or church-owned forest), professional woodcutters and firewood traders. The professional woodcutters have the expertise to select the most appropriate trees to harvest for firewood, plus the experience of working on the steep mountain slopes characteristic of the area. The firewood traders have storage space, transportation and a reliable supply of available labour for the intensive work of cutting and splitting the firewood.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Moeciu commune in Braşov County (RO122). Braşov county is a hilly mountainous region (500 - 2000 metres altitude) located in the south-eastern part of Transylvania. The relief is a diverse mix of mountainous (35%), hilly (50%) and lower altitude plain areas (15%) with an associated land use of forests (mainly in the mountain areas), permanent grasslands (mainly in the hilly areas), cultivated arable fields (in the hilly areas and lower altitude plains and hill areas) plus some urban, industrial and water surfaces (lakes and reservoirs).   The size of the area (km2) is 110. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is unspecified. The total population (in thousand) is 4.722. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 42.93. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 68.2. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.90%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 12600. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 6259.84. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 2.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 35.80%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 61.80%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 10000. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 21007.63. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.40%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 38.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 57.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 17795. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 39.20%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 47980. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is unspecified. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.80%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 40.30%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 51.20%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 42.20%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 48.00%.   Wood continues to be very important fuel for heating and cooking in many households in mountain communities in Romania, including in Moeciu commune in the western extreme of Braşov County where households are very dispersed and basic services such as a public gas supply are poorly developed. This dependence upon firewood puts the local forest resources under great pressure - notably from unregulated and often illegal harvesting and collection of firewood for personal use and/or sale.   Predominantly mixed decidious forest, especially areas which are most accessible for motorised or horse-drawn vehicles.    The harvesting / collection of firewood (mainly beech and birch with some oak, ash, spruce and fir) has been much more strictly regulated in the last few years and commercial sales must be accompanied by a certificate of origin. The records of registered firewood traders are regularly inspected and spot-checks by the police and environmental inspectors ('Garda de Mediu') are also common. However, the increased regulation of firewood (and reduced supply) has contributed to a significant increase in price - around 250% in 10 years - which now provides additional incentive for the illegal trade in firewood to continue and flourish. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural."
