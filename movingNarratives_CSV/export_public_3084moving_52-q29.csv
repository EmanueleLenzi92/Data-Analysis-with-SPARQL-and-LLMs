Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 22 ES. The goats produce various values. On one side, the milky goats are sold for cooking traditional dishes. In addition, it serves as touristic asset as the activity is also promoted by the administration of the Guadarrama National Park. There are some conflicts with the other livestock producers of the area in the use of common lands. Also the neighbours of the municipality play a role because they live with the herd, so they must agree with its presence as a public asset. Regarding the connection with the social-ecological-system, the herd generates multiple benefits and ecosystem services (e.g., fire prevention, cleaning the public land of bushes, composting, cultural asset, and a potential profitable activity).   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra del Guadarrama. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is El Boalo. The MRL belongs to the TERRAE Network. This is a national network of municipalities that use the principles of the Agroecology as values and basis for their development. Therefore, they aim for a sustainable future for their municipalities, with special attention to food chains and social cohesion.   The size of the area (km2) is 40.13.

This is an autochthonous goat breed with public ownership. The herd is owned by the municipality of El Boalo. The herd grazes in the natural mountain pastures of the region, generating numerous ecological benefits, specially in relation to fire prevention. The ownership of the herd is quite special, being the municipality who is in charge of the expenses and also the management of the whole activity. In addition, adding value to this traditional activity with the School of Sheperds and the touristic packages is an innovation in the value chain of small-scale goat production.   1) Abandonment of traditional practices and jobs (sheperd) due to societal and structural changes (demography, modern life style, global markets, competitivity, etc.); 2)Economic profitability; 3) Conflicts with livestock producers in getting access to natural resources (those producers consider the herd as a recreative activity and less important than their meat bussinessess); 4) Finding an interested group of people that may take care of the herd. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Extensive grazing is not an innovative practice, but the public character of this herd, owned by the municipality, is an innovative governance system. However, due to complications in the management and conflicts with some neighbours and other producers, they are currently looking for interested people to take care of the herd. In addition, this activity is used to develop the School of Sheperds that take place every year with this herd. Finally, the herd is a touristic asset with the initiative 'Sheperd the goat' launched by the municipality of El Boalo. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
