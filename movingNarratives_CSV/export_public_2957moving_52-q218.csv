Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ROMANIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 16 RO. Production is divided between men and women with everyone involved respecting the specific sequence of operations. The men are the potters. They select and dig the earth they clean, water, knead, trample and mix to transform it into into the 'clay' from which they produce a red pottery with distinctive shape. Each potter has his/her own method of shaping the clay using traditional tools: a potter s wheel and comb for shaping, a hollowed-out bull s horn and a fine wire-tipped stick for decoration, and a wood-burning stove for firing. Women then decorate the fired pots using specific techniques and tools to draw traditional motifs. Their skill in combining decoration and colour defines the personality and uniqueness of these ceramics. The colours are vivid shades of dark brown, red, green, blue and Horezu ivory . This craft is transmitted through families, in workshops from master to apprentice, and at fairs and exhibitions.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Southern Romanian Carpathian Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Oraş Horezu in Vâlcea County (RO415). The relief of Vâlcea County (RO415) is around one-third mountain area in the north of the county with a mixed land cover of forest and semi-natural grasslands. Two mountain groups dominate the region - the Făgăraș Mountains in the east with heights over 2,200 m and the Lotru Mountains in the west with heights over 2,000 m. These are separated by the Olt River valley (one of the most accessible routes through the Southern Carpathians), along which there are smaller groups of mountains - the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains. The central region of the county is sub-mountainous hilly area with a diverse mosaic landscape of fruit orchards, vineyards and semi-natural grasslands - and in the south there is high plain area cultivated with cereals and vegetables.

A unique type of Romanian pottery (painted clay pots and plates) that is traditionally produced by hand around the town of Horezu (168041) in Vâlcea County (RO415). Horezu is the only centre of ceramic production in Romania in which this trade remains the main source of income for a significant number of local families.   The traditional knowledge and craftsmanship associated with the pottery have been inscribed on the UNESCO list of 'Intangible Cultural Heritage' since 2012 (https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/craftsmanship-of-horezu-ceramics-00610) thereby indicating the existence of a craft-based cultural value chain in addition to the product value chain. This cultural value chain also gives the community a sense of identity, while also providing a day-to-day social function.    Most of the ceramics are sold locally in the galleries of individual families. Tourists and day-trippers are the main customers and for many years have provided a stable demand for the local ceramics and a guarenteed source of income. However, the covid crisis has highlighted that this traditional method of direct sales can be severly interrupted / disrupted by external factors beyond the control of the pottery families. The challenge now is to develop more robust value chains for marketing these very traditional mountain products and there is growing interest in online sales, plus the possibility of some form of cooperation between families to access better established and more resilient value chains. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are The digging of earth to make the potters 'clay' used for the ceramics is not associated with any specific land use system. The local assets include Social and cultural."
