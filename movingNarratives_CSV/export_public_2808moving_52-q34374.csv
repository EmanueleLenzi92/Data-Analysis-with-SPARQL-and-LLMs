Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 GR. Meat production affects the pastures of the wider area of Anogeia and their families. The prospects of the product bring together pastures, cultural associations, local authorities. It also affects local catering, hospitality and agritourism activities. The importance of the VC for the area has been recognized by municipal and regional authorities, who are very cautious in supporting extroversion actions. Anogeia breeders use the transhuman breeding system more than the breeders of other areas to a great extent directing their animals to other areas of Crete (Heraklion, Lassithi). The reference mountain chain of this VC is Psiloritis Mountain. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Anogeia. Psiloritis (Ida) mountain is the highest maountain in Crete and among the highest in Greece, characterized as a Unesco Global Geopark. Phrygana and macchia vegetation dominate up to an altitude of 1,600 meters. The typical maquis vegetation of Psiloritis includes prinos, while scattered are piles of rough pine, cypresses and maples that form clusters up to a height of 1,800 meters. At higher altitudes the vegetation consists of bushes mainly of thorny plants, such as heather. Around Anogeia the shrubby vegetation is prevelant. Relatively close to the town there exist the Skinakas observatory and the Idaion Andron Cave, the cave that Zeus was born, according the Greek mythology. The size of the area (km2) is 102.1. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 680. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1250. The total population (in thousand) is 87.691. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 58.80. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.02%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 76.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.01%. The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 13800. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 1046.08. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 6.52%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 9.33%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 84.16%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 14300. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 7862.21. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.91%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 11.24%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 81.85%. The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 50. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.001%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 13024. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 39. In this region protected areas are present. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 17.38%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 11.83%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 70.79%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.20%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 11.84%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.97%. The meat of sheep lamps and goat kids from the Anogeia area is famous throughout Crete for its excellent organoleptic characteristics. In the area of Anogeia, at an altitude of over 1000 meters, sheep and goat breeding is a traditional activity with more than 80,000 heads of free range animals. The natural flora of Psiloritis mountain contributes to the production of aromatic meat, rich in nutrients, which is used in many different ways. Sheep and goat breeding is a predominant traditional activity in the wider area of Anogeia. More than 200 pastures are organized in a local meat production cooperative. The establishment of the cooperative meets all modern standards for the production of quality meat. In conclusion, the meat of tha Anogeia area is a product of high quality, of great reputation, of predominance of the connected land use system, with territorial identity. The introduction of innovative methods of breeding and slaughtering are vital for the sustainability of the pastoral activities in Psiloritis, which have tremendous impact on the SES of Anogeia. The breeding of sheep and goats in the mountainous areas of Anogeia and the development of pastures is a traditional activity that is closely linked to the local people. Grassland in lower altitudes and forestry in higher ones, as well as natural land, are prerequisite land-use systems for the meat production from free range animals. Until recently, the production was a family business, making it a social norm and a way of life. The cooperative of the local breeders, through the production of meat, give better perspectives for them, their families and the local society. The meat is consumed in large amount in local festivities and agro-touristic events. Livestock farming in the Anogeia area focuses mainly on dual-purpose breeding of sheep and goats (meat and milk). The activity has become economically unprofitable and is heavily dependent on European subsidies because it faces significant competition from other livestock industries ( pork meat, chicken meat, etc.). The local population of Crete shows even today a significant preference for mountain farmed animals due to non-stress type of production. The area of Anogeia is relatively isolated and the population is shrinking. Animal infections and climate change increase the uncertainty and vulnerability of thier activities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. In recent years and on the basis of EU funding, infrastructure (stables, milking machines, feed silos, etc.) has been significantly improved at all stages of rearing as well as slaughter. Lately, the milk whey, a dairy waste, has been utilized as animal feed, a fact that contributes significantly to the environment. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. The island of Crete is characterized by many different microclimates (rainfall, average temperature, flora, etc.). This peculiarity enabled each mountainous area of the island of Crete to have its own sheep breeds. In Anogeia there is the Anogeia tribe, in Sfakia there is the Sfakia tribe etc."
