Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SERBIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 SER. Buckwheat is produced by individual farmers, mostly farmers who also started to grow other old types of grains (spelt, barley, etc.). It is grown almost without herbicides and pesticide, i but it has good yields due to the favorable climate and land. It is also very good honey plant, especially since there are beekepers in the area of Zlatar. Buckwheat is milled in stone mills and packed. It is sold in healthy food stores, as well as in retail stores. Additionally, buckwheat shells are used for making pillows or other products. Besides flower, buchwheat is sold in a format of crusts for human consuption too.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Serbia, Dinaric Alps region. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zlatar Mountain. Zlatar Mountain is in the territory of Nova Varos municipality, and partially Sjenica municipality in the NUTS 3 region of Zlatibor.

Zlatar Mountain is located in Western Serbia, and it is well known for its nature, air (mix of Mediterranean and continental air), lakes and beautiful landscapes. There is a nature reserve (IUCN Ia category) - Reserve Uvac (lake and meanders), home of endangered species / Big vultures. High quality products - beef meat, Zlatar cheese (PDO), medical herbs and buckwheat are important part of the agriculture production with high reputation and presence in touristic offer in Zlatar. Buckwheat has a lond tradition of growing in the area of Nova Varos, some legends say since 14th century. It used to be considered 'poor people' food, but at the begining of 2013, buckwheat was reintroduced in the region of Zlatar. It started in the areas of couple of villages, where it is grown without using pesticides. Buckwheat became very popular as healthy food, especially coming from the Zlatar area, which is considered as clean and ecological. Buckwheat is also grown as organic product (certified). Buckwheat, together with other autochtonous grains like spelt (Triticum spelta) returned as healthy food into people's diets. Buckwheat is grown in mountanious areas, especially in Zlatar region, but, instead of being food for poor, now it brings much higher income to the farmers. Additionally, preparation for market ((milling and packaging) and marketing of the product are creating mixture of traditional and innovative aproach. Buckwheat flower is also used for preparing Zlatar speciality / buckwheat pie with Zlatar cheese.   Key local assets are multi-cultural area, with connections to the neighbouring countries Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Agriculture is mostly extensive, using natural pastures and feeding, and growing buckwheat and other grains/fruits and vegetables with minimum, or no pesticide. Potentials for rural tourism with low carbon print is high. Lakes (three artificial lakes, but of a great beauty) Zlatarsko, Uvačko and Radoinjsko play important role in tourism, as well as in landscape preservation. Beautiful landscapes and forests are specific asset of the area. Production of buckwheat is again becoming important part of image of the Zlatar mountain as healthy, clean and ecological area.    No major challenges are present in the VC. However, populairity of the product creates much larger demand, and therefore wider growingof this grain. Growing conditions are favorable, but also in some years, if the temperature is too high in the flowering season, yields are very small / brining insecurity in the market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Buckwheat was grown in the area of Nova Varos for a very long time, but it was abandoned after the II World War, as it was considered as 'food for poor'. New tendencies and re-introduction of old grains as healthy food in the diet grown without pesticides, made this grain popular again Buckwheat flower is produced in the old mills (stone mills) and the shelves are sold for pillows and other products. No part of buckwheat is wasted. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social, cultural and Habitat of endangered species.   Buckwheat is produced in other mountain areas in Serbia, as well as in plains (Vojvodina). NUTS3 Raska region (RS217) and Pirot district (RS226) are also regions where buckwheat is produced and can be compared B29."
