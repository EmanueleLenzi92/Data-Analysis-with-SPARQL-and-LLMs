Since the middle of the 20th century, a flourishing value chain dedicated to the production of mantecados has been consolidated. The three main bakeries employ more than three hundred people, many of them women. The production of vegan sweets and vegetable fats is an increasingly prominent line of business. Simultaneously, the innovative proposal of artistic chocolate representations, the opening of exhibition spaces and points of sale and the collaboration with other sectors (liquors and hams) attract almost 100,000 visitors to the town in the run-up to Christmas.   The wide range of products uses ingredients such as lard, almonds, sugar, and flour. Most of the raw material is acquired outside the place of production. The traditional productive spaces have been joined by museums and shops that, together with other sites, generate a thematic park of Christmas products.    Diet changes aimed at reducing animal fats and sugar consumption have led to changes in production and the appearance of new products, trying to keep a consumer offer linked to a traditional holiday such as Christmas competitive. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Breaking the seasonality of production is another great challenge. The diversification of the offer and the appearance of new services are considered useful tools for this challenge. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are The value chain connects with sites and resources of socio-cultural and economic value but not with use and productions based on the natural territory itself. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Other regional geographical areas, such as Estepa or Antequera, have special recognition in the production of Christmas sweets, although they compete with an increasingly broad and demanding pastry offer."
