Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 26 IT. Key activities of the VC are vine growing and wine production. The vineyard of Aosta Valley consists of just under 23,5 ha of which more than 18 ha belong to the members of the cooperative 'Cave Mont Blanc', and other 5,5 ha belong to 3 individual wine producers. A peculiarity of local viticulture is the great fragmentation of the cultivated area in small plots of land. Individual wine producers, grape producers, who sell grapes to cooperatives, and the cooperative winery are the key actors of this small value chain. In the last thirty years the wines of Valle d'Aosta have had a remarkable growth in quality, witnessed by the numerous awards at national and international level both in oenological competitions and by guides and magazines. About 70% of the production is consumed locally, thanks to the presence of a flourishing tourist activity that brings more than three million visitors to Valle d'Aosta every year. A share between 10% and 20% is destined for sale in other Italian regions, while the remaining share is destined for export. If, on the one hand, the oenological offer, very fragmented and small in size, does not favor large-scale marketing, on the other hand it finds space in a niche market in search of products on which to boast exclusivity.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Western Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Morgex. Morgex and La Salle are located in the upper Aosta Valley, at the entrance to Valdigne. The municipalities are crossed by the Dora Baltea river and dominated by Mount Paramont (3 300 m) to the south and La Grande Rochère (3 326 m) to the north.The Aosta Valley is a mountainous autonomous region in north-western Italy. Covering an area of 3,263 km2 and with a population of about 128,000 it is the smallest, least populous, and least densely populated region of Italy. The valley is very attractive for tourist for winter sports and for hiking in summer.   The size of the area (km2) is 127.57. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 780. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 3326. The total population (in thousand) is 4. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 31.4. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 3.00%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.5. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.18%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 16857.5. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 4330.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 1.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 18.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 80.40%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16572. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 4330.8. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.20%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 18.40%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 80.40%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 57883. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 1.13%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 242. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 140. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 21.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 76.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 3.00%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 21.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 76.00%.   Wine produced under the denomination of origin 'Vallée d'Aoste Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle DOC' is made from grapes harvested in the highest vineyards in Europe, at the foot of the Mont Blanc massif. Prié Blanc is the variety used for its production and is the only indigenous white grape variety of the Valle d'Aosta. This VC is relevant to the project as an example of a quality boost of mountain viticulture, which offers a high reputation product for local consumers and numerous tourists and contributes to the landscape identity of the Region.   The main resource of Valdostan viticulture lies in the local native vine varieties, grown only in the valley. Many native grape varieties, as part of the Valdostan culture, have recently been selected and replanted. The Prié Blanc, the only native white-berried variety, is one of the rare varieties not grafted onto American vines thanks to special climate conditions that have preserved them from phylloxera. Versatility of this variety allows to produce high quality wines of different types: sparkling wine, dry still wine and sweet dessert wine made from late harvest grapes. The vines are grown on terraces supported by dry stone walls, on embankments or, where possible, in the direction of the slope. Given the features of the terrain and the low rainfall in the area, it is not necessary to take any particular measures to channel and control surface water.    One of the main challenges for viticulture in the municipalities of Morgex et la Salle are the extremely high altitude for vines (above 1200 m), which creates constant risk of frost all over the growing season which in one night take away the hall harvest in one night. Another important problem to be overcome, particularly for mountain winegrowing, is that of increasing the surface under vineyards in order to be more present on the market. (At present, the vineyard surface for prodution of wines with the denomination of originis around 270 ha throughout the region, 24,5 ha belong to the Mountain Reference Lanscape of Morgex et La Salle). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and vineyards. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is also present in other MRLs in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Germany."
