Local production of beer has recently emerged as a new VC in the food sector. The local breweries operate on niche markets with emphasis on teritorry and local consumption. Local breweries are typically associated with tourism, accommodation and gastronomy. Local production of beer utilizes local resources (natural, economic and cultural).   The quality of water significantly impacts on quality of the final product. Local breweries utilize cultural sources of the region. Beer products are usually sold with 'stories' that refer to local history, legends, key personas etc.    Local breweries operate on unique niche markets. Distribution of beer relies on direct sale and eventually - depending on a capacity of a brewery - eshops or specialized shops. The VCs depend on incoming guests. Main challange for the future is make the CV more resilient to changes in a number of incoming tourists, and develop additionl marketing channels for sale. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Technology and fresh ingredients (barley and hops) are usually transported in the locality. However, the breweries are dependent on local sources of quality water. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The VC is useful for the project due to its populariy and high added value for the regional economy."
