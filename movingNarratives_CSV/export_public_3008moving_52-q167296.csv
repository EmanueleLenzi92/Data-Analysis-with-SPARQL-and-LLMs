Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 SCA. This cider is 100% made with local apples. The most common varieties of apples are Discovery, Aroma, Gravenstein and Summerred. The labelling PGI Hardanger cider guarantees the use of local apples and has already proved its quality by winning international cider awards. Fiord is great for apple production due to the combination of milder temperatures in winter compared to other regions of the same latitude, and also warm and long days along spring and summer. The milder winters together with the light reflexion from the water of the fiord make apple trees thrive and flourish properly. Cider from Hardanger covers the 80% of the cider sold by Wine Monopoly (a government owned retailer of alcoholic beverages). Finally, the prosperity of this activity is also an asset for attracting new inhabitants and keeping the locals in the region.

Succesful registration of the Geographical Indication that has been accompained by an increase in production and profitability. The area is historically well known for the apple production. The new products are the toursitic tours offered in the area and by the cider brewers. The new marketing strategies are linked to the PGI, as it was the first Norwegian alcoholic drink with a geographical indication.   The Hardanger fiord is a unique location for apple production due to the minerals that flow down from the mountain soils plus the unique climate that the Gulf Stream brings to this region, causing higher temperatures than in other locations of the same latitude. The apple production started back in the 13th century brought by British monks and soon the cider production started.    As the specifity of this product comes from the unique climatic conditions of the Hardanger fjord, climate change can affect the quality of the fruits and also increase the related pests and diseases. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The cider making is a traditional activity of the region, however, here, they have found their way to add value to this product. With the PGI the Hardanger cider upscaled in the markets and became an important asset for Norway, as it is presented as one of the best ciders of the world. In addition, this VC is now an attractor for visitors that enjoy the recreational assets of the fiord together with cider tours. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   This VC is also a toursitic asset for the fiord and farmers. Regarding the MRL of the VC, it is present all along the Hardanger fiord."
