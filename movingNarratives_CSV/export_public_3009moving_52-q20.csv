Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 03 SCA. In Scandinavia, about 6500 Sami are engaged in reindeer herding. Overall, in Norway and Sweden only Sami people with ancestors linked to reindeer herding have the right to be recognised as reindeer riders. In Finland, even if that is not mandatory, also Sami people are the main practitioners of this VC. In June-July, every calve is marked in the ear, indicating who is the owner (each herder has its own mark). Each year the maximum number of reindeers per region is regulated by the managerial organism (the Norwegian Reindeer Husbandry Administration (subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture of Norway) , the County Administrative Board (according to the Swedish reindeer husbandry act) in Sweden, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Finland). In Finland, within the declared reindeer husbandry area, reindeers have permission to graze freely regardless of the land ownership. The main product of reindeer herding is both raw meat and cured meat (during spring to let it dry under the sun and cold wind), but also skins and bones are used for handicrafts. Besides, there is also an important touristic industry linked to this VC.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Guovdageaidnu - Kautokeino. Guovdageaidnu - Kautokeino is one of the two main cultural settlements for the Norwegian Sami area. It is the largest municipality in Norway and it shares a border with Finland in the South. It is located in the Finnmarksvidda mountain plateau, covered by birch and sparse pine forests, extensive bogs and lakes. The most characteristic activity is the reindeer herding. It hosts one of the main Sami festivals, the Easter Festival of Kautokeino, where visitors can learn about Sami culture, experience some traditional activities and purchase handicrafts.   The size of the area (km2) is 9707.35. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 192. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 970. The total population (in thousand) is 2.91.

High reputation and quality product linked to ancient traditions. It is the main activity to sustain Sami livelihood and it has been of great importance for Sami people for centuries. There are new products linked to this VC as well as new practices in the herd management. Lastly, the EU granted a Protected Designation of Origin to the Lapland reindeer meat and cold-smoked meat is adding value to this VC.   This VC is highly linked to the arctic pastures and conditions. Reindeers are completelly adapted to this climate and natural environments. In addition, nowadays the VC operates in a complex network of organisations at regional, national and international levels (e.g., County Administrative Boards, Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Sami Parliamen , and the Finish Reindeer Herder's Association). Within each country the VC functions slightly different so the interactions among organisations is quite important to guarantee the rights of Sami people. Finally, this practice represents part of the Sami heritage and means a lot for the Sami's identity.    In some areas an increase of certain industrial land uses (ex. mining, wind energy, logging) threats the reindeer pastures. In addition, measures must be taken to control the attacks of large carnivores. Finally, climate change is expected to challenge the VC as climate patterns may change with consequences on arctic ecosystems. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The innovation relates to new techniques and mechanization of some processes. Nowadays, snowmobiles and tracking collars are used in reindeer herding in winter. Besides, there is a growing touristic industry based on reindeer herding. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The reindeer graze on pastures with an area of approximately 146 thousand km2 in the provinces of Finnmark, Troms, Nordland and Trøndelag, which is 40% of the mainland part of Norway. In Sweden, reindeer herding is practised almost everywhere in the provinces of Norrbotten, Västerbotten, and Jämtland, and in parts of the provinces of Dalarna, Västernorrland, and Gävleborg. Reindeer pastures occupy about one-third of the territory of Sweden. In Finland, there are 56 districts in the reindeer husbandry area, 41 of which are in the Province of Lapland and the remaining 15 are in the Province of Oulu, covering the reindeer area around the 33% of the country's surface."
