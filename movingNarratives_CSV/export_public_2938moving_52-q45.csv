Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is PORTUGAL ESTRELA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 PT2. Wool used in the production of Burel comes from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira autochthonous sheep breeds and also from Portuguese Merino breed. The sheep are shorn and only the best quality wool is used for textile purposes. The spinning allows the transformation of wool into yarn with the desired thickness, which is then used in weaving. After weaving, the wool fabric is beated and scalded in a machine called Pisão, which causes it to shrink by about 30% to 40% and transforms it into Burel. Burel is more resistant than wool fabric. Different Burel Products such as wall panels, carpets, curtains, cushion covers, poufs and benches, suitcases, backpacks, footwear and clothing items are produced and then sold locally, nationally and internationally.

Wool from two autochthonous sheep breeds (Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira) is used to produce Burel Products. Burel is highy connected to territoral identity as it is the traditional material used to make the shepherds' cloaks. Burel products are available through e-commerce. Burel is highly characteristic of the MRL. Burel is highly connected to land use and landscape management. Burel is produced from wool which is 100% natural, biodegradable and renewable.   Bordaleira Serra da Estrela sheep breed has a medium stature and is white or black in color. It has horns curled forward and females have a well-developed udder. It has, predominantly, dairy aptitude. Churra Mondegueira sheep breed is of medium stature and is white in color.    Reduced number of shepherds, as this job is sometimes seen as unattractive, due to being physically demanding, in sometimes harsh weather conditions, and low wages. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Burel is a sheep's wool fabric of medieval origin, often associated with shepherds' cloaks. Nowadays, it has reinvented with new colors and new purposes giving rise to new products with very distinct functions. These products take advantage of burel characteristics: abrasion-resistant, water-resistant, acoustic and thermal insulation, hygroscopic, anti-electrostatic, among others. The innovation is related to New products and new colours. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include N/A."
