Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 ES. The organic production of olive oil in mountain areas represents a small group of producers and a niche market that can guarantee their survival as long as a specific market niche, sufficient public aid, and a process of training and internal leadership are consolidated. At the present time it gathers a small group of producers that generally must go to companies located outside the municipality to acquire inputs and to elaborate the olive oil, except for a small family oil mill that elaborates its own oil. Neither of them put their oils on the market except in a symbolic way. The local olive oil cooperative does not have an organic production chain, although it does certify its production under the BAENA Denomination of Origin brand. The main reason why this Denomination of Origin was created is the diversity of varieties existing in this municipality, which, however, is hardly valued commercially. The municipality attracts thousands of tourists, which represents an opportunity for the trade of local products.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Zuheros. The municipality of Zuheros is located in the Sierras Subbéticas Cordobesas Natural Park, with clear characteristics of a mountain area. Its agriculture and livestock, given the geomorphological characteristics of the area, have always been integrated with the management of the mountain ecosystem. However, the initial abandonment of cereal and legume crops in higher altitude areas, the decrease and simplification of livestock farming and the current evolution of the olive grove which is more closely linked to the mountain (between abandonment and ploughing for its transformation), mark a trend to which only an innovative process (organic production, regenerative practices associated with the conservation of the landscape and the ecosystem, social and business leadership, development of alternative commercial channels) can provide an answer and structure a balance for the coming decades.   The size of the area (km2) is 42.36. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 500. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1300. The total population (in thousand) is 0.635. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 14.99. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -17.20%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 97. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been -0.01%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 9426.19. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 13153.1. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 10.50%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 17.61%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 71.89%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 16409.45. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 150440. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 6.53%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 20.01%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 73.46%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 169. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0,03%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 151. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 65.9. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 12.90%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 20.62%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 66.48%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.44%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 16.41%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 74.15%.   The organic olive farming can contribute to the conservation of mountain ecosystems, protecting soils, biodiversity and generating social and economic benefits. It adds to existing quality certifications (Protected Designation of Origin), other quality schemes and recognitions linked to the territory, ecology, diversity of varieties or the articulation of the sector. The small group of producers together with a small processing company, develop their practice under the regulations of the European Union for organic production and certification of authorized bodies.   In general, the old traditional olive groves are maintained, based on a complex number of local varieties. However, the replacement of these olive trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, by new specimens is increasing, often altering the plantation framework and tending towards monovarietal crops. In areas located at higher altitudes, with difficult access, steeper slopes and difficult mechanization, there is an unstable balance between plots that are beginning to be abandoned and others that maintain a management adapted to the ecosystem with an important presence of associated natural vegetation.    Emphasis should be placed on: greater interest by producers in innovative systems; greater coordination among producers; the development of processing chains and specific products under organic certification; reference to local varieties of olives and mountain cultivars; the opening of specific marketing channels; synergies with other sectors such as culture, the environment and tourism; adaptation to climate change; technical improvements and capacitation in regenerative agriculture. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The value chain has open space for innovation but today it behaves basically as a traditional chain except for the compliance of a small group of producers with the regulations associated with the organic production system. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Similar characteristics occur in many other mountain ranges in Southern Europe where olive oil is produced. However, with some exceptions, a specific value chain has not been articulated that would gain in scale while connecting organic production with innovative and integrated regenerative practices with the conservation of mountain ecosystems and landscapes."
