Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 34 IT. Individual winegrowers and small cooperatives are producing high quality red wines of two typologies: classic red wines under the denominations Valtellina Superiore DOCG Sassella and the wines made from dried grapes under the Sforzato denominations. Both typologies had gain an important reputation worldwide and are successfully distributed in Italy and abroad. The Consortium for protection of Valtellina Wine plays an important role not only in terms of quality protection but also in marketing and promotional activities. The Region of Lombardy is making contributions available for restoring and preserving dry stone walls, repairing roads and adapting water conveyance systems in order to protect the terraced landscape for the benefit of viticulture and the safety of the walls. The area forms the part of touristic itinerary Valtellina Wine Road.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Central Eastern Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Castione Andevenno. Castione Andevenno is a municipality in the Province of Sondrio in the Italian region Lombardy. Located on the sunny and sheltered Rheatic slope, it has very favourable microclimate climate for winegrowing. Castione Andevenno is one of the municipalities producing Valtellina wines under prestigious Sassella cru.   The size of the area (km2) is 17.03.

High quality red wines produced in the area, very successful marketing strategies introduced in the last decades focuced on the mountain origin of the products ('Nebbiolo from the Alps'), 2500 km of terraces as a human input to the unique mountain landscape.   The terraced layout of the Valtellina vineyard is the element that most characterises the area. Traditional know-how of building the dry stone walls was transmitted trough the generations of wine-growers. First of all, the terracing made it possible to reclaim the foothills for agricultural use and then it also became an important contribution to the mountain scenary. The other important asset is the Nebbiolo grapevine variety, famous also in other Italian regions (Piemonte), but giving wines with different characteristics when grown in mountains.    Highly fragmented vineyard plots are all located on a difficult terrain (altidude and steep slopes), construction and maintenance of dry stone walls is needed in order to support the vineyards. All this factors lead to very high production costs. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and Social."
