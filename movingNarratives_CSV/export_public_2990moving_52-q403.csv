Small producers with expert knowledge on how to cultivate and process the berries. VC dependendent on the local and natural conditions which are amply available but under threat of the effects of climate change, predomintantly drought, excessive rain, late season frost and hail storms. Strongly connected to local cultural traditions and important contributor to local culture. Important contributor to fruit production in Serbia and to export to other countries. New marketing strategies as well as innovative production and processing facilities could potentially contribute strongly to increased production and export.

Serbia is the biggest producer and biggest exporter of frozen rapsberries in the world. The raspberries from Arilje, Serbia, with its Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), are a synonym for quality and refined taste which can be attributed to the rich and fertile soil, favorable climatic conditions but also to them being grown in small family farms. Arilje is the location with the biggest concentration of farms, the highest revenue, the biggest cold storage, the best quality raspberries and the special culture of raspberry farming including methods to continously remove sprouts. Arilje raspberries are immediately frozen after picking and cleaning to conserve their freshness and ready them for further processing while increasingly raspberries are also produced to be sold as fresh or died products, adding more value. Serbia is one of the biggest producer and exporter of raspberries. The Arilje PDO is grown under favorable soil and climatic conditions on small farms, handpicked and with special methods for treatment and processing. It is a highly sought after product with much potential for expansion and improvement, contributing to improved local and regional socio-ecomic conditions and quality of life. Main threats are related to climate change but also VC organisation that is transparent, representative and allows for acknowledged fair contirbution of all players. New marketing strategies are needed to expand capacities to improve existing markets and to create and reach new ones.   Good soil and climate conditions. Strong local knowledge on how to cultivate and process the production. Connection with other berry producing areas in the region such as Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Fruit production is a major provider of employment but fruit production in Serbia faces a number of problems ranging from outmigration of workers due to socio-economic conditions to problems posed by the effects of climate change. The biggest challenges production of all fruits in Serbia due to climate change faces are drought, excessive rain and flash floods, late season frost and hail storms. Often these extreme weather events follow each other in short succession thereby exacerbating the problems. While increasing temperatures can improve growth and quality of the fruits, water shortages pose serious problems for fruit growers. In addition, there are increased chances of pests due to existing ones or in the form of invasive species that are on the move due to climate change. Measures such as early warning systems, hail rockets, hail nets and irrigation systems are applied to combat these hazards but require substantial investments. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. With its substantial production volume and the fact that Serbia s fruit industry is one of the leading sectors of the Serbian economy, as well as a contributor to Serbian export, integration with EU and global markets is the logical next step. With growing investments in hi-tech orchards, climate change adaptation measures and logistics infrastructure, Serbia s modernised fruit production is on the rise and expected to increase in both volume and export. Important contributor so local employment and socio-economic development. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
