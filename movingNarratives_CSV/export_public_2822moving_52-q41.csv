Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 18 GR. The natural beauty of Pelium, a mountain with close proximity to the sea, along with the well-organized traditional apple cultivation create a composite bundle of activities in the area, compising of touristic, forest and farming activities. The local apple producers and their families retain their bonds and their resilience mainly because of their income from apples. The extrovent local cooperative has introduced innovations in production (organic cultivation and control of pests and diseases) and in marketing, which are vital for the sustainability of the area. The authorities in local and regional level and academic institutions contribute to the efforts. The resilience of the mountainers has a positive impact to the preservation of the forest and the development of complementary activities (truffles/mushrooms, apicature, logging, etc.).

Apple trees are cultivated in Zagora area (Pelium mountain, Thessaly) from 300m to 1100m. The apple cultivation is wide-spread in the area. The combination of the microclimatic conditions of the mountain and the sea breeze that prevails in the area, is one of the main factors of the unique taste of the Zagora apples. For over a century the local farmers have been organized in a very successful cooperative which promotes the apples to the Greek and international market. The Zagora apples are PDO/PGI, of high quality, high reputation, territorial identity and high exports. Apple cultivation is traditionally dominant in Zagora, an area of exceptional natural beauty. The vast majority of the producers participate in the local cooperative, which ensures Integrated management of high-standard production, high quality of products and an established brandname. Traditionally, the role of the female farmers is very crucial: in every family the female members are responsible for the sorting and packaging of apples. The VC exibits a traditional and cultural, a success story of a cooperative and innovations in the production and in marketing.   The area of Zagora is of outstanding natural beauty. The apple trees are cultivated with nature friendy techniques in high slope fields. The farmers of the area are organized in a highly efficient cooperative, in which the role of women is very important. The cultivation /exploitation of apples is traditional and nowadays is the most important economic and social activity in the area, which incorporate cultural activities such as an annual apple festival. The international market competition is intensive and sets the high-quality and the guaranteed quantity as prerequisits. The climate change makes the trees valerable and introduces a harvest precariousness. The economic uncertainty in national and international level could become a threat for the business model of the cooperative. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative. The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The cooperative has introduced innovative ways for the control of pests and diseases, based on academic research and participation in EU projects, along with a system of Integrated Production and Organic Production. Apart from apples, the products of the cooperative include the production of apple chips for diabetics, apple juices and organic apples and condensed juice (petimezi). The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural. Similar VCs based on apple production can be identified in MRL (NUTS3): EL532, EL651."
