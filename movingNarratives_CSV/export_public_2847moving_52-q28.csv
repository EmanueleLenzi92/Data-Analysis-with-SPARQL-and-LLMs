They are currently developing a farmers' market/shop/and catering facility and a small processing plant for fruit and vegetables to be used by the whole community. The VC considers a new process and new governance system, because the municipality initiate projects, which is not common. They try to create a sustainable village, which is also uniqe.   The municipality creates and manages a community garden, supports local organic producers with agricultural land and other assets owned by th local authority. They run a transnational project for saving local fruit varieties and create a fruit garden. They turn an old public kitchen into a small fruit and vegetable processing plant open to be used by the local community, etc.    Challenges in connection with climate change (draughts, extreme weather events, etc.). To find enough resources for the implementation of all projects (in Hungary, local governments do not have independent income, they rely on external sources). Located in a beautiful hilly area, overtourism, big investors and rising real estate prices and population change can be future a problem (these problems also show signs now). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The VC is innovative, because all these initiatives are not obligations for a municipality, but extra commitments. We can count the VC traditional, since it relies on local conditions, local land and traditional verieties. The idea and knowledge comes from inside, from the local mayor and his team, but also from outside, because the mayor studied about sustainability on various universities. The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
