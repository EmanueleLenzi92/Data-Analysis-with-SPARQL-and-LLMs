Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 2. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 41 CH2. Familiar farm of 2 hectares of land. The plants are planted, weeded and harvested by hand, then gently dried in a specially designed dryer. Each plant requires a specific treatment that must be respected at every stage from planting to packaging. Some of the plants are purchased from other producers of the VBKB association, which groups together the producers of organic medicinal plants from the Swiss mountain regions. All the products are then transformed directly on the farm, into herbal tea or cosmetics and sold online or on site. The production is certified organic.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Jura. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Vaulion. The MLR is a region composed of limestone rocks, which are permeable and have difficulty retaining water, forming a succession of shallow valleys and high plateaus. It is covered by forest and wooded pasture. Milk and cheese production are the first agricultural resource of the massif. Temperature vary strongly between summer and winter and the annual rainfall are abundant ( 1000 mm). Clock-making by farmers in the form of peasant clockmakers has been practiced since the Middle Ages and offers a cultural heritage to the region.   The size of the area (km2) is 1.32. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 852. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1483. The total population (in thousand) is 0.50. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 37.79. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 9.71%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 199.83. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 23346.60. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 79468.40. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.99%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 29.59%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 69.42%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 23346.60. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 120370.80. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 0.80%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 28.02%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 71.17%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 9. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 0.01%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 12. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 40. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 37.65%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 29.63%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 32.72%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 2.55%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 15.85%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 81.36%.   Cultivation only in mountain areas, high reputation product with a strong demand from consumers and cosmetics companies for the valorisation of medicinal and aromatic plants and herbs, fast-growing market, mostly organic and nature-friendly production, direct sales and e-commerce.   The production depends on altitude, which has a beneficial effect on secondary plant metabolites as long as traditional knowledge.    Complex crops with some problems related to planting, fertilisation, plant protection, optimal harvesting date, cutting frequency and height, drying and storage; weed, disease and pest pressure; difficulty in covering production costs with the selling price, development and preservation of swiss mountainous traditional culture. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and cultural.   The farm is a member of the VBKB association, which brings together all organic medicinal plant producers in the Swiss mountain regions."
