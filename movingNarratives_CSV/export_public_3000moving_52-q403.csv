Zlatibor Mountain is one of the most popular touristic places in Serbia. Health tourism, skiing, hiking, adventurous, and other types of tourism are very much present in the area. Due to its popularity, some of the processes are not fully in line with environment protection, and there is a tendency of over-urbanisation. Municipality of Cajetina where Zlatibor is located also started some positive changes - projects for waste management and recycling, together with programmes of education for school children on environment protection. Zlatibor is well known for its food too - kajmak (milk skim cream salted), cheese, dry beef meat and other good quality products have high reputation. Dry beef meat (Govedja prsuta) is PDO, but it needs renewal of the protection, due to the new procedures for certification. Village Sirogojno is worldwide known for its handmade wool sweaters and other wool handmade products, also protected as GI / non-food product. There are villages open museums, showing the typical organisation of villages in the area, with typical houses of the area made out of stone and wood. Livestock production is prevailing, together with fruit production. In 2019, Zlatibor was the most visited mountain in Serbia with 237.064 tourists and 777.057 nights. The numbers of tourists were highest in May, August, then October and April. Average duration of tourist stay was 3.2 nights. Percentage of foreign tourists is about 30%. In 2020, number of tourists dropped by around 30% in number, but the number of spent days was smaller. Zlatibor was one of the few destinations in Serbia that did not have more significant drop, comparing to other touristic destinations. The area is well known for its natural values, as well as for the quality products. Beauty and natural values of the Zlatibor Mountain are endangered if there is no deep understanding of the effects of the current touristic expansion. Support to the actors trying to initiate some positive changes is needed. The investment planning takes place now over sustainable development planning. New strategies and governance systems need to be developed, and some good initiative need to be supported and expanded (waste management, protecting cultural and touristic assets).   Key local assets are specific climate - sub-alpine climate / wind rose is specific in this area, winter and summer are mild, and the number of sunny days is very high - more than 2000 sunny hours per year. This creates good conditions for air - spa, where many people come to recover after respiratory infections, anaemia and if having problems with thyroid. Flora and fauna are rich, with high content of medical herbs on meadows and different wild animals and species. There are many wolves in the area, as well as boars, foxes, squirrels, rabbits, etc. Culture and history are very rich in the area. Zlatibor became touristic place long time ago - at the end of XIX century, and it was known as 'trendy place' where kings also used to come for holidays and recover. Landscape is unique, and the area is rich in waters, rivers and beautiful and rich caves.    Over-urbanisation of the area is one of the biggest challenges of Zlatibor as a touristic destination. This brings other problems to the sceene, like waste management, water treatment, air pollution, etc. Initial steps were taken by the municipality of Cajetina, but there is a lot of space for improvements. De-forestration is also becoming important challenge, especially because the mountain was named according to its beautiful pine forests (Zlatibor - golden pine, Pinus Silvestris Variegata Zlatiborica which can only be found in the village Negbini, and is under state protection). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Beside commercial and urban tourism, Zlatibor is developing other interesting touristic offers / rural tourism - offering tourists to participate in field works and other on-farm activities; Health tourism - very clean air, combined with favourable winds and high number of sunny days, provide conditions for rehabilitation of respiratory diseases, anaemia and problems with thyroid. In the areas of Zlatibor Mountain which are not so close to the urban part, new types of tourism are also developing - hiking and Nordic skiing. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland, Grassland, Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Mountain tourism is developed also in the area of Kopaonik (Raska NUTS3 region), Stara Planina (Pirot NUTS3 and Zajecar NUTS3 regions)."
