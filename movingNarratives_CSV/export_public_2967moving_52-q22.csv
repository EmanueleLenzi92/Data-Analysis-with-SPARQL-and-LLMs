Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 UK. Most of the Scottish projects are being developed by Angus Davidson Ltd (consultancy based in Inverness) and all projects from this source are being validated by Organic Farmers and Growers C.I.C., which also includes Scottish Organic Producers Association (co-operative) so new actors enroled in this process. These actors are not within the LAU1 or RR9. Other actors are 6 landowners involved, NatureScot (Government nature/environmental agency) and consultants to advise on actions and do the measures (blocking gullies etc). Educational training and resources now being provided to upscale this approach across Scotland. VC very dependent on local assets but the national Peatland Action Programme is being rolled out to the whole of Scotland (including all RR9) and UK Peatland Code covers all UK. About reaching UK/Scottish climate and biodiveristy targets.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Ross and Cromarty. Ross and Cromarty is a region in the far north of Scotland. It is very remote from the largest cities in Scotland, but it does contain parts of the commuter belt to the city of Inverness and some small towns. Most people live in the lowlands and eastern coastal areas of the region. The uplands and west coast are very sparsely populated with spectacular scenery of mountains, moors, lochs and a rugged coastline.   The size of the area (km2) is 5202.051845. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -3. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1094. The total population (in thousand) is 55.581. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 10.68. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 2.44%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 22243.38. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2345.4. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 4.10%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.60%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 73.30%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 8124. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 13.52%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 10230. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 197. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.16%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.33%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 75.51%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Scotland has 1.7mill ha of peatland storing 1.6 billion tonnes of C, but 80% in poor condition. To reach net-zero by 2045 need to restore potential emission sources. Funding for landscape scale, multi-year projects generates skilled jobs in rural areas. Also biodiversity and flood prevention outcomes. UK peatland code (under IUCN) provides independent verification for growing natural capital investment market. Peatland common in upland/mountain areas in the UK, associated with extensive grazing and sporting (hunting game). Example of (re) valorising habitat/land cover previously considered of no economic value. 5 projects in development and one validated project, (Lochrosque Estate, working with 250ha over 100 years, to restore 27 ha eroding bog and 223 drained bogs, with predicted emission reduction of 87,000tCO2e). Currently the EU ETS averages around 23euro/tCO2e. Restoration actions on blanket and raised bogs are being innovated and improved, along with techniques by consultants and experts. The Peatland ACTION programme is a new arrangement with NatureScot (gov agency) that allows funding for nature improvements to be tied to IUCN Peatland code, allowing carbon trading to occur based on predicted restoration and sequestration processes. This involves new actors and brokers e.g. most Scottish projects on registry implementedX via Angus Davidston Ltd (agricultural consultant).   Investment would not be possible without natural asset (raised and blanket peat bogs and associated hydro-ecology); and lack of competing land uses (e.g. not allowed to plant trees or plough the land). Peat used to be associated with local fuel source but no longer occurs in uplands due to environmental/climate concerns. But also land tenure important most projects on large estates where owners willing to invest in restoration as long-term natural capital investment due to having other income sources (often estates are tax havens) so not managed for food production nor does it have to sustain a family.    Since 2012 Peatland ACTION programme only restored 25,000 ha and only 4 verified projects covering 100,000 Pending Issuance Units on UK Land Carbon Registry (20 projects in development) illustrating difficulties in recruiting land managers and achieving restoration. Increasing concern that peatland become sources not sinks for GHGs. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Restoring peatlands that were considered low value land is relatively new. Requires local knowledge to get land manager uptake and practical familiarity with peat bogs to do the work; but the funding scheme, UK peatland code, and actors involved in validation tend to be exogenous (but within Scotland). The innovation is related to New processes and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are N/A. The local assets include Natural and Social.   Other publicly visible peatland restoration under the Peatland Code can be found in Scotland (Achnacarry Lochaber LAU1, Carrick in Arygyll and bute; Ceannacroc, Skye and Lochalsh; Dryhope, Scottish Borders;; Glutt, Caithness, , Invermark, Angus Glens;, Rottal Estate, Angus, , Talla, Gameshope and Carrifran, Scottish Borders); Wales (Aberdwesyn Hill, Powys; Blaen y Coed, Conwy; Bwlech y Groes, Gwynedd, Glaslyn, Powys, Rhiwargor, Gwynedd) and England - New House, Oughtershaw and Stake Moss in N Yorkshire; Webster Meadown in Lancashire). Not all of these are EMAs but will be areas of natural constraint. Those in bold are 'validated' the rest are under development."
