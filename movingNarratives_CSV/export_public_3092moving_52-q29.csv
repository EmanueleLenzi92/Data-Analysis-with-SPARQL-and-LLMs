Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 41 ES. The cooperative La Troje is the main actor but cannot be seen isolated from the network in which they operate (from residents of the area to other organisations, research insitutions and municipalities). Their impact on the social-ecological-system comes with the promotion and use of local varieties that enhance the knowledge on local food production and they are normally less dependent on external inputs (as they are adapted to local conditions), making the systrem more resilient.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Sierra del Guadarrama. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is El Berrueco. Located in the Northern Sierra, its main activity in the past was used to be related to livestock (being grazed in the open forests 'dehesas' of oaks and ash trees). Within the MRL there is a part of the water reservoir of el Atazar that is visited by many citizens from the area and Madrid city during summer to enjoy a bath.   The size of the area (km2) is 28.43. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 830. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1164. The total population (in thousand) is unspecified. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 27.33. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 28.42%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is unspecified. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) is unspecified.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 14858.07. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 0.018458. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 0.25%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 25.93%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 73.82%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is unspecified. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 539. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is unspecified. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 66.347. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 0.66%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 25.00%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 75.00%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is unspecified.   1) Production and reproduction of local varieties of seeds. These seeds are the result of multiple generations of farmers using these varieties along the mountain range; 2) Breeding of endogenous vegetables and fruit trees; 3) All the activities are carried out under the framework of agroecology; 4) Local economies. This association is innovative in terms of their approach to the activity. Not only they produce seeds and plants but foster a change in the agricultural system towards one that is more equal, fair and sustainable. The innovation comes then with their holistic approach to the sector (working on seeds, plants, compost or gardening) and with their parallel activities in research, education and activism.   1) The loss of endemic vaireties that cannot be retrieved anymore; 2) The climate change causing rapid changes in the local conditions that may hamper the efficacy of these seeds; 3) The policies that regulate the seed trade and production; 4) The access to markets and the dominance of comercial varieties of seeds; 5) The change on diets that leave aside many traditional vegetables and do not attend to seasonality. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Plant breeding is not an innovative activity nor are the varieties or techniques that they are using. However, the innovation comes with the multidisciplinarity of this association. They breed local varieties in collaboration with local experts, putting in value the local and traditional ecological knowledge. In addition, they give courses on various topics related to gardening (from seedling to composting). They distribute their own products to keep the direct relationship with the consumers or they sell at small stores that share their principles. They are a cooperative that works to build regional networks of agroecology. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
