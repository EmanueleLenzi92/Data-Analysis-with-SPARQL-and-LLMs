The pure juniper distillate is relatively expensive and has an intensive flavor. For that reason, it is diluted with neutral alcohol and water. The detailed recipe is known only for producers. It is very traditional spirit drink in Slovakia, recognized also by EU as Slovak national drink.   Natural assets are forests and meadows for juniper ( Juniperus communis L) and cropland with cereals for gin part of the spirit. Juniper is an evergreen shrub found in dry, rocky soil in the Slovakian mountains. Especially the shrub fruits and branches from Juniperus communis are used.
