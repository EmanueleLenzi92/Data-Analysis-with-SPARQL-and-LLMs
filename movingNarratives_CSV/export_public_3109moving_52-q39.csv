Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SWITZERLAND 1. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 12 CH1. Gran Alpin is a label for cereals produced above a certain altitude and in organic production systems. It also supports the production of more varieties of cereal. Some cereal specialties, such as buckwheat, used to be grown much more in the mountains, but were then replaced by imported products. In recent years, some producers have started to grow buckwheat again in Graubünden.This is because some traditional mountain dishes are prepared with this cereal, e.g. pizzocheri, a traditional pasta-like dish in Graubünden.

Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. the only innovation is the label and thus the way of marketing and highliting the high quality of the product. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
