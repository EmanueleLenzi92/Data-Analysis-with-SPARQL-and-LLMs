Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 UK. Forestry and the the timber industry are of huge importance to the Scottish economy, with processing £285 million of Gross value added to the economy each year. Furthermore forestry provides more than 30,000 jobs (inlcuind wood production, forest management, haulage and processing). Much of the processing takes place in non-mountain areas, but the wood is often grown on the shoulders of mountains, such as in Argyll and Bute LAU1 (generating £58 million per annum GVA and roughly 1300 direct jobs and 2255 indirect jobs). This area contains semi-natural woodland. Forestry has dual purpose here - for production and for recreation. Argyll Forest Park is Britain's oldest forest and offers opportunities for mountain biking, hiking, wildlife watching. Much of the commercial forestry here is however processed outwith the LAU1. 49 of the LAU1's 122 SSSIs are designated because of their woodland.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Highlands and Islands (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Argyll and Bute Mainland. The mainland of Argyll and Bute is a region in western Scotland, which includes relatively remote peninsulas (Cowal and Kintyre) and some islands. Due to the long and indented coastline and mountainous landscape, road access is relatively poor (involving a long journey to the north) and ferries provide important connections between islands and the mainland. The area has suffered depopulation in the last ten years: there are a number of small towns distributed across the region. The area has extensive forests and moors, with higher mountains and tourist destinations in the north.   The size of the area (km2) is 4493.659279. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is -3. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 1126. The total population (in thousand) is 52.885. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 11.77. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -4.85%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 11.44. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.52%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 21200.32. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 2790.74. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 5.43%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 22.07%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 72.50%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21856.90. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 13770.61. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 4.03%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 27.20%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 68.77%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 29913. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 49.78%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 1944. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 54.6. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 6.25%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 16.67%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 77.08%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 9.29%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 17.26%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 73.45%.   Scottish Government aim to have 21% of Scotland covered by forests by 2032. Forestry used for multiple pursposes - i.e. timber, recreation, but also increasingly biomass energy. Argyll and Bute has a high reputation for forestry, containing most of the forestry sites across Scotland. Also it is an important value chain with multiple connected actors and for multiple purposes (ie., timber vs recreation). Important linking to other land uses i.e. potential conflicts with land owners/ farmers. Roughly 30% of Argyll and Bute's land mass is covered is commercial forestry and as such biomass boilers have been installed across multiple locations in the LAU1 to reduce the carbon footprint.   Natural assets - the forested areas are of key importance, for production, setting and attractive scenery. Social assets - forestry activities require good and productive relationships with forestry managers/ workers, landowners, tourists, local communities. Cultural assets - there are strong links, particularly in Argyll and Bute between the heritage and ancient quality of the forestry and the identity for those in the region. There is also reliance on traditional knowledge for processing and understanding the best growing conditions for various types of forestry.    risks to the forestry areas due to climate change, carbon sequestration levels. Risks from Brexit/ COVID-19 for increased/ decreased visitor numbers of forestry recreation sites to reduce economic value of areas from decreased numbers but also potential for erosion/ damage from increased numbers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Use of forestry for timber and recreation is traditional, but use of biomass heating and energy is more innovative. This is also increased interest in forestry for social prescribing which can include forest walking and recreation activities within the forest areas. The innovation is related to New products. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   Forestry is present across the Highlands and Islands Region, as well as the wider UK. Key locations include within Badenoch and Strathspey LAU1, Northumberland LAU1, Newry and Mounre LAU1. Across the UK forestry is used for the dual purpose of recreation and timber production."
