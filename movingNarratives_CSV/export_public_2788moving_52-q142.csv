Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE INRAE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 FR. Brocciu is a whey cheese from ewes and goats milk, obtained after making cheese. It depends on other VCS, dairy cheese production and on-farm cheese production. In its code of practice, PDO Brocciu is dependant on pastoral ecosystems, schrubs, summer pastures, etc. animals (of local breeds) must be fed with local fodder (grazing or hay). The current production of Brocciu knows a disembedding process : it might be less intertwined with the local socioecological system, that is local population on one hand, natural resources on the other hand.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is Corsican moutains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Corsica. Corsica is an island in the sea. It presents a great diversity of landscapes: plains, hillsides, deap and steep valleys Small ruminant farming has long been a transhumant activity, occupying all the region. For the past decades, farmers have settled, in the plains and hillsides. Some of them keep on using mountain pastures during Summer. They are scattered within the region, with no remarkable specialised sub-region. The area of production of PDO Brocciu is Corsica.   The size of the area (km2) is 8722. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 0. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2706. The total population (in thousand) is 0.334. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 38.6. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 38.6. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 1.10%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is unspecified. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 25400. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 8034.12. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is unspecified.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is unspecified. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is unspecified. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2626. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 333. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is unspecified. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.036. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.162. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 0.802.   high reputation products, coexistence between mountainous area and plains, legitimacy to produce between dairies and on-farm cheese makers, competing access to land use, vulnerability of ecosystems (fire, lost of biodiversity, erosion of heritage), resources linked to pastoral breeding (breeds, feeding species) and their associated know-how are diminushing. PDO Brocciu is currently the only GI for corsican cheeses. It benefits of a strong reputation, but issues have been raising about how it is used. A part of corsican on-farm cheese makers do not adhere to it as they do not feel recognized within it and they do not want their reputation to be associated with dairy processing. the PDO is mainly used by Corsican dairies. There are strong doubts about the origin of milk which is used and potential fraud. For the past years, the syndicate has frequently derogated to the code of practice and allowed more intensive practices.   to (re)assemble resources that have been built and transmitted in the territory (breeds, feeding species.. ) and to be able to address the issues raisen by the agroecological transition. To ensure sustainable coexistence between different stakeholders with divergent stategies and interests. to adress issues of common heritage (food, local culture). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. There are no noticeable innovation in this VC. Brocciu Corse is recongnized as a PDO since 1998. Since then, production and cheese processing is regulated by a code of practice.It has been managed by a syndicate that gathers farmers and dairies. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland, Natural land and agrosylvopastoral systems (schrubs, forests of oaks - accorns, meadows). The local assets include Natural and cultural.   Dairy husbandry and production of Cheese is observable in every other MRLs. Recognition of GIs is also a common features of those areas."
