Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 16 AT. The fish is sold directly, via the gastronomy and mainly by an association named 'ARGE Oberkärntner Fisch'. This association is a cooperation of the 4 fish farmers (who produce 'Kärntna Låxn'), some fish breeders and innkeepers, the regional fishing association and the LAG Nockregion-Oberkärnten. The fish is the lead product of the like-named 'Genussregion' and in these regard a representative quality product of the region. Positive impacts on the SES regards the re-stabilization of wild populations of the lake trout, since fish, which is sold, comes from fish farms with natural ponds.   The reference mountain chain of this VC is RR 11, Austrian Alps. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Spittal an der Drau (No: 206). Carinthia is the southernmost federal state of Austria. The fish is produced in the mainly mountainous region Upper Carinthia (NUTS3: AT212). Since Carinthia is located south of the Alps, the climate is almost Mediterranean in summer. It is characterized by relatively constant weather conditions with high solar radiation, which alternates with thunderstorms and intense precipitation. While summers are hot and moderately humid, winters are long and harsh. Autumn and winter often feature temperature inversions with calm winds, dense fog over the frosty valleys, and mild, sunny weather higher up in the foothills and mountains. The fish is produced at an altitude between 751 and 843 meters above sea level in 15 natural ponds supplied with spring and stream water. The water temperature of the ponds varies between 8 degrees Celsius and 15 degrees Celsius. The natural ponds are supplied with sufficient fresh water, so no enrichment with oxygen is necessary. The average pond area is about 1 hectare.   The size of the area (km2) is 2765. The minimum altimetry of the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 512. The maximum altimetry of the LAU is 2143. The total population (in thousand) is 75.868. The population density (Inhabitants/km2) in the LAU is 27.44. The population change rate of the LAU in the last 10 years (%) has been -3.39%. The overall regional population density (Inhabitants/km2) is 58.86. The regional population change rate in the last 10 years (%) has been 0.82%.   The average per capita income (EUR/year) [Province] is 19933.3. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Province] is 3181. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 3.33%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 28.92%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Province] is 67.75%. The per capita income (EUR/year) [Region] is 21135. The total Gross Value Added (GVA) (EUR million/year) [Region] is 18731. The primary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 1.72%. The secondary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 34.03%. The tertiary sector share of total GVA/year [Region] is 64.25%.   The total number of bed places (BPs) in tourist accommodations/year in the LAU (Local Administrative Unit) is 42315. The regional (Region) share of total BPs/year is 30.79%. The number of agricultural holdings in the LAU is 2228. The nearest settlement with population over 100000 (km) is 75. In this region protected areas are present.   The primary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 8.85%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 23.94%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Province] is 67.20%. The primary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 5.56%. The secondary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 22.81%. The tertiary sector share of total employment/year [Region] is 71.62%.   The 'Kärntna Låxn' (= lake trout from Carithia) is a quality fresh fish product from Upper Carinthia. From there already in the 14th century this fish was delivered to the imperial court in Vienna. A few years ago, 4 fish farms managed to breed again a fish species that was firmly rooted in former times and to anchor it as a fixed point both among consumers and gastronomy. Since 2008 this VC is embedded in a Genussregion ( region of local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria), which means that the fish is a regional high quality product. The 'ARGE Oberkärntner Fisch' (see key actors) has been an important cooperation for the stabilization of the sustainable fish farming: stable fish population and new marketing. Also the 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria) has been a key factor of success.   The production of 'Kärntna Låxn' has been a tradition for more than 500 centuries. The name of this fish has been an important marketing asset since ever. The 'crystal clear' water from one of the high mountain regions in Austria is also part of the marketing communication. The 'ARGE Oberkärntner Fisch' is important for the fish breeding and marketing.    Due to overfishing mainly in Lake Millstatt in the 1970s the fish population decreased dramatically. The marketing as a high quality product is a niche that allows a) a better income for the producers and b) to cultivate the fish sustainably. The trout is known to be vulnerable to climate change. Lake Millstatt is a deep lake which is not that affected although in average the temperature increased by more than 2 K. Since the fish is mainly produced in 'monocultures' in natural ponds that are not so deep, the production might be more affected than wild populations of these fish in the big lakes and rivers. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The marketing under the name of 'Kärntna Låxn' has a long history. After the problems of overfishing in the 1970s there have been made great efforts to rebuild the natural fish stock and the lake trout population by breeding in near-natural ponds since the late 1990s. In 2001, four fish farms around lake Millstatt and neighbouring lakes began to breed the fish species (lake trout), which was the dominant species in earlier times, and to offer it again to consumers and in the gastronomy. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Lakes, natural ponds. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   The 4 producers of 'Kärntna Låxn' are situated in the districts: Spittal an der Drau, Feldkirchen (both same NUTS 3 region) and Villach Land. Beside 'Kärntna Låxn' there are also four other regions in Austria, where the fish is both a traditional Austrian food and the lead product of a 'Genussregion': Ausseerland Seesaiblinge (artic char), Mattigtal Forelle (trout), Salzkammergut Reinanken (coregonus = salmon) and Ybbstal Forelle (trout). In addition there are 3 other regions (total 8), where the fish is only classified as traditional Austrian food (without being a Genussregion): Neusiedlersee Fisch (fish from lake Neusiedl), Steirisches Teichland - Karpfen (carp from the region 'Styrian pondland'), Waldviertler Karpfen (carp from the region 'Waldviertel'). Another four fish varieties are nation-wide classified as traditional food: trout, common carp, coregonus (salmon) and artic char."
