Narrative,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is FRANCE CCVD. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 FR1. Organic still wine production is an innovative VC in the Drôme. It was developped in response to Clairette de Die (famous local sparkling wine) crisis. In fact, Drome viticultors were strongly specialized in the Clairette de Die production while this product's sale are decreasing. To face the crisis, some producers adapted and offer new proposition of still wines. These wines are produced on old converted Clairette de Die vinyards within local grape variety. This VC is mainly represented by organic or biodynamic production practices and vinification process. Drome quiet wines respond national quality label such as: Vigneron Independant, Biodynamic, Agriculture Biologique..

In order to face Clairette de Die crisis, some vinyards developped a new offer of organic still wine convertir old Clairette de Die vinyard with different vinification processes and local valorisation of the products. New products: new still wines using local grape variety New processes: new type of vinification accroding to organic and agroecological models. New marketing strategies: local valorisation in local market or direct sales New governance systems: organisation out of Clairette de Die unions and cooperative. New viticultor group: Cairn.   Natural asset: promotion of organic and agroecological models of production and vinification. Social asset: solution to a strucutral crisis by the creation of new opportunities at local level. Promotion of a different type of local wine. Local valorization through direct sale and local markets.    This VC is innovative as it was developped as a solution to adapt to the Clairette de Die crisis (decrease of sales). Organic grapes production was used by viticultors to develop new products (organic still wine) and new processes (organic, biodynamic, agroecology), new organisation (out of Clairette de Die unions and cooperatives). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is unspecified. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Conversion of vinyards previously dedicated to Clairette de Die into organic still wine production. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland. The local assets include Natural and socialscenary)."
