Three different cheese producers in Nivegy-valley micro-region. They produce high quality artisan cheese and milk products. They keep animals (goat/cow) and their products are marketed in SFC-s, restaurants, farmers markets, on-farm-sales and webshop delivery. Quality local products in a micro-region. Special design, short supply chain sales. High adaptability. There is also a cheese maker who, in addition to his family of 8, can also employ 2 employees - successful model.   The cheese makers use local grasslands as a resource. Nearby the area (Lake Balaton, Káli Basin) there are a lot of tourists, which provides them good opportunity to sell their products. Some of them carry on the traditional animal husbandry activities of the area and the family in a modern way (marketing, new sales channels). They also have a good impact on the social environment, as they employ people.    Climate change (warming, new pests, extreme weather conditions). Civilisation/urbanisation pressure on the Mountain landscape. During COVID, they have problems to sell cheese (lack of tourists, no events, no restaurants, hotels). They have lots of other challenges characteristic to very small producers in Hungary. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Animal husbandry are traditional in this area, however, cheese-making, especially high quality, beautiful packaging and short supply chains, sales via the internet are innovative. All the three cheese-makers started from no experience with cheese, however two od them are from traditional peasent families. The third is from a city with no agricultural past. They all use innovative tools, small machinery, solar power, ICT for marketing, etc. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural."
