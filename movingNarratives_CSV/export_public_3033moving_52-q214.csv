Quality certificates about ecological production, organic farming, and quality marks for herbs, fruits, and tea mixtures. The farm also received various awards, e. g. Award for the most beautiful farm up to 500ha; Award for a company with a turnover of up to 2 million euros. One of the local assets is the clean environment in mountain areas. Thee-commerce is also related to this VC. Organic production requires more handwork. Thus this kind of production contributes to local employment. It is a good example of crop production in mountain areas rending a good quality of mountain environment and respecting natural consitions.   Natural assets are cropland with herbs production, meadows for local herbs collection, and forests for berries collection. The social asset is a social recognition of organic farming's importance and willingness to pay higher prices for bio-quality products. The cultural asset is traditional knowledge about the health effects of local plant species and agricultural production in a local biophysical context without chemicals.    1) climate change and related environmental quality changes can influence the quality of producing herbs and fruits. 2) organic production requires more handwork (e.g., hand skinning, hand-harvesting), but the herbs' production is seasonal. 3) Due to the processing and storage of organic food without chemicals, their storage life is shorter. It requires more frequent processing, packaging, distribution, etc. At the same time, the organic food needs to be controlled at all production and processing stages. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Production and processing of endogenous species of herbs and fruits in a bio quality, using the nevironmental quality in mountains. The innovation is related to New processes. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.   No similar VC in Slovak mountains were found. Other municipalities in mountains where medicinal herbs produced are: 523402, 526967, 543462."
