A young couple - lifestyle entrepreneurs - moved to a village. They collect truffles with their dogs in the Balaton Uplands area. They sell processed products and organise guided truffle collecting tours. Truffle is a special product, and can only be found with dogs. The processed products, cheese stuffed with truffle, oil with truffle, salt with truffle are innovative products, not existed in the area before. Offering truffle hunting as an adventure is also innovative in Hungary.   This VC uses the forests in the area to look for truffles, using dogs that is a method based on traditional culture and knowledge (though in this area it is innovative). Being part of a local immigrant community seeking sustainable lifestyles connects them to short food chains.    Creating their processed products only from local ingredients (e.g. using local artesanal cheese would rise their prices too much). Uncertainty, whether they can continue to use forests to collect truffles. Marketing their truffle-adventure tours. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Innovative.   The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. The processed products within this VC are special and innovative (truffle stuffed cheese, oil with truffle, salt with truffle). Looking for truffles is rare in the area, this VC is based on external knowledge. They are also in connection with a local community promoting sustainable lifestyles and creating and spreading knowledge in this field. The innovation is related to New products and New processes. The land use systems involved are Forestry. The local assets include Natural and cultural."
